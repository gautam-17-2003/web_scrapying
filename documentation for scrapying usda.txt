Steps followed : 


* We started with scraping https://www.usda.gov/topics 
* Beginning with scraping the content available directly under the topics i.e. Animals, Farming etc. 
* After that we scrape the content of subtopics under various topics.
* We made different folders for topics and subtopics itself.
* Under the folder in which the content is scraped, the folder is named as the topic or subtopic for the same url.
* At last we got almost 600-700 kb of data.
