Sprinkler Irrigation Design  
This is lecture number  21 in the  series of irrigation and drainage  course which is  on 
Sprinkler Irrigation Design . In this lecture , we are going to focus on how to  design 
sprinkler irrigation .  We are going to discuss the simple design here and in the next lecture , 
we going to see the hydraulic design of sprinkler irriga tion. 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:58)  
 
The first picture above  presents  the sprinkler irrigation system  layout . The sprinkler system  
consist s of the water source , a pump , the main s and sub mains , the laterals  and then 
sprinkler s to riser  pipe, bends , air vents or air valves , joints , etc., so the whole  system 
consists of these components . An enlarge d view of the sprinkler is shown in the  picture  
above where  the water is be ing spread on the soil surface . Then there is a riser pipe  which 
makes the head and there are hook , gasket and other things to make  the pipe fittings . 
Sprinklers  are mounted on the lateral s (as shown in the layout above) , and then the re is the  
mainline and the pump , it pumps the water through the mainline and then through the  
laterals and the riser pipe and the sprinkler . And the sprinkler sprink les the  water just like 
rainfall . The sprinkler can have  a different kind of  sprinkler nozzles . In the image above 
the impact -sprinklers  are shown , which  is the most commonly seen sprinklers  for 
irrigation . It has the spreader  nozzle  and then range nozzles and there  is an impact arm that 
is going to cut down the flow  and spread s the flow . The water flows out of the sprinkler at 
a trajectory angle , this angle determined the wetted area and impact force of the sprinkler 
droplet.  If you see  in the image  the water ejects from t wo outlets  (spreader nozzle and 
range nozzles ) and the sprinkler  head  is going rotate clockwise  and then the jet which is 
been  created  is going to spread into the air and the water is falling like  rainfall. 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:22)  
 
The image above also shows the spray pad sprinklers , where the water which is falling on 
the pad is going to splash and fall down , that why it is called the impact  sprinkler and 
similarly in the case of serrated deflector pad  it has  some serrations  when  water is falling 
on it, it is going to create  a kind of  splash , and that  will sprinkle water all around .  Mostly 
these kinds of sprinkler s are seen in the case of center pivot  sprinklers . 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:28)  
 
Next is  the design  aspect of the sprinkler irrigation syste m. The first thin g is system layout 
and then operating pressure , nozzle dia meter , sprinklers discharge , and wetted  diameter . 
Then s pacing between sprinkler s and laterals  is very important to be able to irrigate the 
entire  area. Then the design of mainline and sub -lines  involves the length  and diameter  
and also the material , so these three  things  will be considered while designing a pipe or 
mainline and subline .  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:20)  
 
Then  pivot or ranger length , so what is  the range r length . Suppose i n the center pivot  
irrigation, the system is going to  rotate around  in a circular direction, s o in one rotation  
how much  area it is going  to cover  is the ranger length.  System capacity  for water supply  
and then pump  design is also important to maintain the desire d pressure in the system . 
In the sprinkler discharge , there is a thumb rule that there  should no t be more than 10% 
variation  between the points of highest and lowest pressure in the  system . So, if you have 
a pump  in a system ; we have more pressure at the head end than  at the  field end, so the 
pressure difference  between them should not be more than 10%. The difference  between 
the maximum and minimum pressure in a sprinkler  system  should not be  more than 10%. 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:49)  
 
The design principles for sprinkler irrigation are ; first thing is  to estimate the application 
rate which is based on  planned crops or atmospheric  water demand  and soil intake rate. 
So, you have to consider  what is  the crop we are growing and what kind of soil you are  
using and what  atmospheric  parameters   are influencing in that particular area . These 
things should be ta ken care of before and then draw a  layout  based on your area  and decide 
the number of moves  and optimize the sprinkler spacing  and then lateral s, nozzle size , 
operating pressure  - that provide design application and distribution pattern . 
Design of sub main s, main lines  and supply lines  such that required  quantities  are conveyed 
to all operating la terals lines in the required pressures . Finally, the design of the pump and 
power units such that it can efficient ly convey the water to the last point  of the  system  
layout . So, these  are the  principles or basic  things you need to consider in the design . The 
first thing is  the application rate  and layout , sprinkler  spacing . And then main , sub-main , 
laterals and pump designs .  
(Refer Slide Time: 09:47)  
 
Simple Sprinkler Design  - let us consider a simple sprinkler design , not hydraulic  designs . 
So, the first  step is to determine the daily maximum supply  required for  an area for a 
targeted crop . The estimation of  this volume  of water required to irrigate that particular 
area is based on the maximum evapotranspiration . So, in sprinkler irrigation , all crop s are 
expect ed to be sprinkle d with water  just like rainfall , not like  in furrow  and b order 
irrigation where you irrigate  at one end and it leads to the other end or tail end . Here we 
expect the  water which is sprinkled is falling on  the ground uniformly  all around just like 
rainfall . 
The main principle in sprinkler irrigation is you have to replenish the evapotranspiration 
daily  water requirement .  So, every day you have to turn on  and off  the system and irrigate 
the water which is re quired by the plants , that is why it requires less water compared to 
border and basin irrigation s. Another  difference in surface irrigation and sprinkler  
irrigation is in surface irrigation we look for  soil moisture  and irrigation should be  uniform 
throughout , but here we focus  the irrigation on ET based . 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:21)  
 
𝑉𝐴=𝐴×𝐸𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝐸𝑎 
𝐸𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 =𝐾𝐶×𝐾𝑆×𝐸𝑇0 
Where, 𝑉𝐴 = Required volume of water for the area A (m3); A = Specific area that is to be 
irrigated (m2); ETmax = Daily maximum evapotranspiration (m) ; Ea = Design application 
efficiency of the sprinkler ; ET0 = reference evapotranspiration at peak water demand 
period; KC = crop -coefficient at peak water demand period ; KS is the soil moisture stress 
coefficient   In case you are not following any soil moisture stress then KS is equal to 1. KC 
is a crop coefficient  and it has different values for different crops , you can refer to  the FAO 
56 book for different  for values of K c.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:40)  
 
And t hen once you have the volume of water which is required for the particular day  
determine the discharge rate  for a particular  number of hours  QA. The di scharge rate is 
estimated as follows  
𝑄𝐴 (𝑚3
h⁄)= 𝑉𝐴 (𝑚3)
𝑡(h) 
Then o ptimize sprinkler  and lateral spacing  this is important , from the mainline  there is a 
pump  that is pumping and th ere is a lateral where  sprinkler s are installed at different 
locations on the lateral . So, sprinkler to sprinkler distance  is Sm and lateral to lateral 
spacing is Sl. So, when we estimate the area  which is Sm into Sl and then multiplied with 
the average application rate  (so whole  area needs to be  irrigated  with a particular depth 
that is I), the discharge rate at individual sprinkler i s given as follows  
𝑞= 𝑆𝑚×𝑆𝑙×𝐼 
Where,  
q = discharge rate for the individual sprinkler (m3/h) for the area (S m × S l) m2 
Sm = sprinkler spacing along laterals (m)  
Sl= lateral spacing along mainline (m)  
I= average application rate (m/h)  
𝐼=𝑄𝐴
𝐴, if not limited by soil intake rate  
 (Refer Slide Time: 16:44)  
 
So, knowing the  discharge rate , another thing is how to find out the distance between the 
laterals  and distance between sprinklers in th e lateral .  
𝑆𝑙= D ml (1 − F/2) and Sm = D mm (1 − F/2)  
Where D ml and D mm are the manufacturer’s rated wetting diameters of lateral sprinkler and 
mainline sprinkler, respectively;   F is the overlapping factor, normally taken as 0.5 –0.75.  
For windy condition, the overlapping factor may be as high as 1.0  
While irrigating through the sprinklers a circular area is wetted if you do not overlap the 
field you will have some  dry spot . So, to avoid dry spots  the distances between sprinklers 
should be reduced  to get the corners of the  whole fie ld wet. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 19:36)  
 
Number of sprinklers , n=A
Sl×Sm 
Determine System Capacity  QST= ∑ QAin
i=1  
Where i is the number of sub -area like “A”  
 (Refer Slide Time: 20:21)  
 
And finally, once you  estimate the system capacity and multiplying with the head you get 
the power required  to pump th e water  at a head HT 
P=QST×9.81×HT 
HT=Hm+Hf+Hr+Hs+Hsf 
P = power (KW)  
QST = total discharge rate for the system (m3/s) 
HT = total pumping head (m)  
Hm = pressure head required to operate the sprinklers at a minimum required pressure (m)  
Hf= total frictional head in the lines (m)  
Hr = maximum riser height from the pump level (m)  
Hs = suction head ( the vertical difference be tween pump level and source water level after 
drawdown) (m)  
Hsf = friction head loss in suction line (m)  
And so with this all , you get to total  head loss or pumping head . So, next, let us see an 
example of a simple  sprinkler design . 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:31)  
 
Example 21.1:  
A farm of 25 ha is planned to be brought under sprinkler irrigation. The textural class of 
the soil is loam -to-silt loam, having moisture content at field capacity (FC) and permanent 
wilting point (WP) of about 42% (by volume) and 26% (by volume), respecti vely. An 
infiltration test data showed that the constant (basic) infiltration rate is 2 mm/h. A hardpan 
(relatively impervious layer) exists at a depth of 2.0 m below the soil surface. The l ong-
term average reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) rate in that a rea is 4.5 mm/d. Vegetable 
crops are planned to grow in the farm, and the crop coefficient ( Kc) at the maximum 
vegetative period is 1.1. The climate is moderately windy in a part of the season. Design 
the sprinkler irrigation system (various components) fo r the farm. Assume the standard 
value of any missing data.  
Solution:  
Given,  
Area, A = 25 ha = 250,000 m2 
FC = 42% (by vol.);   
WP= 26%  
Ic= 2 mm/h ; ET0 = 4.5 mm/d  
Kc= 1.1  
Dimp = 2 m below soil surface  
Wind status: moderately windy  
 (Refer Slide Time: 24:14)  
 
Now, the solution steps:  
1. 𝐸𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝐸𝑇0 × 𝐾𝑐 = 4.5 × 1.1 = 4.95 𝑚𝑚 /𝑑 
(Assuming depletion of soil -moisture up to readily available level, so that 𝐸𝑇 occurs at its 
maximum rate, i.e., soil moisture stress factor, 𝐾𝑠=1) 
2. Daily water requirement  for the area, A (i.e., for the whole -farm here) is  
𝑉𝐴=𝐴×𝐸𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝐸𝑎 
 (Refer Slide Time: 25:34)  
 
Assuming application efficiency, 𝐸𝑎= 80% , i.e., 0.8  
Then, 𝑉𝐴=250000 ×(4.95
1000)
0.8=1546 .875 m3 
3. Discharge rate, 𝑄𝐴 = 𝑉𝐴 
𝑡 
Here, t= irrigation period = 4 h (assuming for the prevailing windy condition)  
Thus, QA = 1546 .875
4×3600=0.1074  m3/s 
4. Discharge rate of individual sprinkler, q= Sm×Sl×I 
Sl=𝐷𝑚𝑙 (1−𝐹2⁄)  𝑎𝑛𝑑  Sm=𝐷𝑚𝑚 (1−𝐹2⁄) 
Assuming overlapping factor, F = 0.7 (higher for windy condition)  
Taking a manufacturer rated wetting diameter for mainline and lateral sprinkler as 12 m 
and 10 m, respectively  
 (Refer Slide Time: 27:07)  
 
𝑆𝑙=12 (1−0.72⁄)=7.8 𝑚 
                                                     Sm=10 (1−0.72⁄)=6.5 m 
Application rate, 𝐼 =𝑄𝐴/𝐴 = (0.1074 ×3600 )/250000  =1.5468  mm/h, which is 
less than the soil infiltration rate.  
Here, assuming 𝐼 = 2 mm/h (to minimizing evaporation loss in windy climate)  
Putting the values, 𝑞 = [7.8 × 6.5 × (2/1000 )] × (1000 /60) =1.69 l/min  
5. Number of sprin klers, 𝑛=𝐴
𝑆𝑙×𝑆𝑚=250000
7.8×6.5=4930 .9≅4931  
Note: The above calculation is for fixed lateral. If moving lateral is used, no. of laterals 
should be based on the maximum working /pump operating period. Note that each setting 
requires 4 h for the above calculation, so 16/4 = 4 settings can be operated if 16 h is the 
working period.  
Besides, the number of laterals should be based on the dimension of the land, lateral size 
available in the market, etc.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:37)  
 
Power required  (motor capacity required), 𝑃=𝑄𝑆𝑇×9.81×𝐻𝑇 
Here, QST=0.1074  m3/s 
HT=Hm+Hf+Hr+Hs+Hsf 
Hm = pressure head required to operate the sprinklers at the minimum required pressure 
(m) = 28.05 m (= 40 psi) (assuming)  
Hf= total frictional head in the lines (m)  ≈ 5% of H m = 1.71 m (assuming/estimating)  
Hr = maximum riser height from the pump level (m)  = 1.5 m (assuming)  
Hsf = friction head loss in suction line (if suction line exists)  = 0 
Hs = suction head ( the vertical difference between pump level and source water level after 
drawdown) (m) = 0 (assuming that water is pumped from the supply canal)  
Thus, HT=31.26 m  
Thus, 𝑃 = 0.1074  ×9.81 × 31.26 = 32.94 KW 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:48)  
 
Summary  design parameters are as follows: Taking for fixed laterals:  
Pump capacity: QST= 0.1074 m3/s 
Irrigation period = 4 h 
Motor capacity: P = 32.94 KW  
Lateral spacing along mainline: S m = 7.8 m  
Sprinkler spacing along lateral: S l= 6.5 m  
Number of total sprinklers: n = 4931 nos (Ans.)  
So, this is the sprinkler  simple design we haven’t  considered any hydraulic principles in 
it. It gives the number of sprinklers , the spacing and pump capacity  
(Refer Slide Time: 31:32) . 
 
Example 21.2:  
Determine the required capacity of a sprinkler system to apply water at the rate of 1.25 
cm/h. Two 186 m long sprinkler lines are required. 16 sprinklers are spaced at 12 m 
intervals on each line. The spacing between the lines is 18 m.  
Solution:  
Given:  
I = 1.25 cm/h  
Sl = 12 m  
Sm= 18 m  
Discharge in each sprinkler, q = 12×18×1.25/100= 2.7 m3/h 
System capacity, Q= 2.7 x (16+16)= 86.4 m3/h 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:02)  
 
Example 21.3:  
Allowing 1 hour for moving each 186 m sprinkler line described in the previous example, 
how many hours would be required to apply a 5 cm irrigation to a square 16 ha field? Ho w 
many days are required assuming 10 -h days?  
In this example  which is the extension of so previous example , here the extra information 
is given . So, here 2 laterals are  move  to another place  after irrigating a particular area and 
the moving time of sprinklers is 1 hour. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 34:04)  
 
Solution:  
Irrigation time to apply 5 cm irrigation at the rate of 1.25 cm/h  
  = 5 / 1.25 = 4 h  
Time required for moving the lateral = 1 h  
Total time per setting = 4+2= 6 h  
Area of field = 1,60, 000 m2 ;  Length of field  =√160000 =400 m 
(Refer Slide Time: 35:48)  
 
The entire length of 400 m is converted by the two 186 m laterals, spaced 18 m apart, 
hence the number of moves required  =400
18=22.2 say 22 moves   
Total time required for irrigation =22×5=110ℎ =110
10=11 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 36:43)  
 
Example 21.4:  A sprinkler system is to be designed to irrigate 8 ha of the vegetable crop ( 
Root  zone depth = 60 cm ) in deep silt loam soil (Limiting application rate = 1.3 cm/h; 
Moisture holding capacity = 9.5 cm/m depth) in a moderate dry climate.  
The field is flat. Assuming the allowable depletion level = 50 %, water application 
efficiency = 75 % and peak rate of moisture use by crop = 5 mm / day,  
Determine the net depth of water per application, the depth of water pumped per 
application, irrigation period and the required system capacity in ha - cm per day.  
Assuming that system is operated for 1 5 h each day, determine the pump capacity in lps.  
Solution:  
Total available moisture in the root zone =9.5×60
100=5.7 cm 
Net depth of irrigation  =5.7×50
100=2.85 cm 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:39)

𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦  = 2.85
0.75=3.8 cm 
Irrigation period  =2.85
0.5=5.7, say 6 days  
To cover the field in 6 days the system must be able to pump and discharge  
=3.8×8

The pump capacity, Qsys 
From Equation (2)  
𝑄𝑠𝑦𝑠=2780  8×2.85
6×15×75=9.4 lps 
So, this is all for  this lecture , mostly in this lecture we focused on sprinkler irrigation the 
simple design . The sprinkler  system consists of a water source pump mainline , sub mains , 
laterals , sprinklers . And then other components like a filtration system, valves , air vents , 
etc. Basically in the sprinkler irrigation system , our focus is to irrigate the crop to meet the  
evapotranspiration demand or its  consumptive use . Lets us say  today the 
evapotranspiration is 8 mm per day . So, your sprinkler system should apply  that much 
water on the field , every  day you need to operate the  system . In this simple design , the 
discharge at each sprinkler , lateral spacing , main spacing , pump capaci ty and power 
required to operate the pump  are studied. P umping from the  source of water  to the sprinkler 
head  required some  mechanical work to lift water from source to this sprinkler head . So, 
during that process , we need to consider the total head . If you have a suction on , that means  
the source is below the pump central line you have the suction  component  so, you consider 
that head and their corresponds friction head ; and then  the head in the lateral pipes and 
mains  and head at the sprinkler head  riser pipe and operating the sprinkler . So, all together 
combines the total pumping head and when you multiply that with the system capacity , it 
will give the power required to pump the discharge to  the sprinkler system . 
Thank you  so much .
