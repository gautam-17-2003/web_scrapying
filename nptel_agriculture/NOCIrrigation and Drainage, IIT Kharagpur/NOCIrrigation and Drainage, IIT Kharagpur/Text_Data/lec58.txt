Irrigation Performance Evaluation  
Hi friends, this is lecture number 58 on Irri gation Performance  Evaluation. Up  to the previous 
lecture s we have completed the drainage part , in this lecture , we will be talking about irrigation 
performance evaluation.  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:08)  
 
Irrigation efficiency:  the water in the field can be lost in different wa ys it generally may have 
happened  through spray droplets , weed  water use , soil evaporation, furrow evaporation, leaks 
in the pipeline, seepage , and evaporation from irrigation ditches, surface runoff , and deep 
percolation.  So, in the case of sprinkler irri gation , the droplets can evaporate so that is a loss 
and in case of surface irrigation or any other irrigations weed growth is commonly seen,  which  
also require s some water  and also s oil evaporation . All these losses include the amount of water 
you are giv ing and it is not utilized by the plant.  
So, sometimes this causes inadequacy  in irrigation application  and results in  crop water stress 
and yield reduction . Sometimes excess irrigation application results in pollution of water 
resources because the excess  water can cause runoff that carries pollutants and pollute s the 
surrounding water bodies.  Hence the efficient use of irrigation water generally maximizes the 
economic return and water resources sustainability, this is what we are expecting from efficient 
use of irrigation water. The first thing is to get an economic return and the other one is the 
sustainable  use of water resources .  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:40)  
 
The beneficial use of irrigation water are 2 types crop evapotranspiration requirement and then 
leaching of salts from the soil, the first one is to grow the crop the other one is to remove the 
salts from the root zone so that it would not cause any osmotic stress on the plants. The non -
beneficial  use of irrigation water is evaporation from water and  soil surface which does not 
contribute to crop productivity.  
Irrigation efficiency is defined from 3 point s of view one is the irrigation system performance , 
the second is uniform ity of water application and the third is the response of the crop to 
irriga tion. So, we are going to see the different indicators  to understand how the system is 
performing for the given irrigation water.  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:36)  
 
Irrigation efficiency evaluat es the irrigation system performance. There are 6 indicators  viz.,  
Water conveyance efficiency ; Water application efficiency ; Soil water storage efficiency ; 
Irrigation efficiency ; Overall irrigation efficiency ; Effective irrigation efficiency  
(Refer Slide Time: 07:15)  
 
Water Conveyance Efficiency ( 𝐸𝐶)  
The water delivered  to the farm or field is usually less than the water diverted from the source. 
Due to canal seepage loss, canal spills, evaporation losses from canals, and leaks in pipelines.  
𝐸𝐶 =𝑉𝑓
𝑉𝑡×100 
Where, 𝑉𝑓 = volume of irrigation water that reaches the farm or field (acre -inch)  
𝑉𝑡= volume of irrigation water diverted from the water source (acre -inch)  
Typically, conveyance losses are much lower for pipelines due to reduced evaporation and 
seepage losses.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:28)  
 
2) Wat er Application Efficiency ( 𝐸𝑎) 
The objective is to apply the water and store it in the crop root zone to meet the crop water 
requirement.  
𝐸𝑎 =𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑓x100  
Where,  
𝑉𝑠 = volume of irrigation water stored in the root zone (acre -inch);  𝑉𝑓= volume of irrigation 
water delivered to the farm or field (acre -inch)  
Water loss from sprinkler system ( Wind drift, Evaporation from droplets in the air, crop 
canopy , and soil) and surface irrigation ( Runoff, Evaporation from furrow channels and so il 
surface, Percolation)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 11:02)  
 
The table above is showing the potential application efficiencies for a well-designed  and well -
managed irrigation system. For example,  sprinkler irrigation of  low energy precision applicator 
(LEPA) has 80  to 90 % efficiency and linear move sprinklers  and central pivot have 75 to 85 % 
efficiency  and solid set have 70 to 85 %. And compared to sprinkler irrigation  surface irrigation 
are less efficient with 45 to 65 % efficiency  for conventional furrow . The micro -irrigation  
systems can go up to more than 95 % efficiency in the case of subsurface drip irrigations.  
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:08)  
 
3) Soil Water Storage Efficiency ( 𝐸𝑠) 
It indicates how well the system uses the available root zone storage capacity to store water  to 
meet crop needs.  
𝐸𝑠 =𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑓𝑐−𝑉𝑎×100 
Where, 𝑉𝑠 = volume of water stored in the soil root zone from an irrigation event;  𝑉𝑓𝑐= volume 
capacity at field capacity in the crop root zone;  𝑉𝑎 = volume of water in the soil root zone before  
an irrigation event  
Refillin g the soil profile to about 90 %  of the field capacity can be a good strategy.  
Sprinkler and micro -irrigation systems usually supply only sufficient water to satisfy crop  ET 
needs without filling the soi l root zone  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:36)  
 
4) Irrigation Efficiency ( 𝐸𝑖): Irrigation water may be applied for other beneficial uses.  
Removal of salts (leaching requirement)  
Microclimate control (evaporative cooling frost protection)  
Seedbed preparation  
Germination of seeds  
Softening of soil crust  
Chemigation  
When more t han ET water used is considered, only beneficial care is considered in (E i) 
𝐸𝑖=𝑉𝑏
𝑉𝑓×100 
Where, 𝑉𝑏 = volume of water beneficially used. Water losses that occur as a result of excessive 
deep percolation, runoff, weed ET, wind drift are  not considered beneficial uses  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:08)  
 
5) Overall Irrigation Efficiency (E o) 
𝐸𝑜=𝐸𝑐×𝐸𝑎× 100 
Where, 𝐸𝑐 = water conveyance efficiency (fraction);  𝐸𝑎 = water application efficiency 
(fraction)  
6) Effective Irriga tion Efficiency ( 𝐸𝑒) 
Reuse of runoff water decreases the amount of water pumped from a source and can improve 
overall irrigation efficiency.  
𝐸𝑒= [ 𝐸𝑜+ (𝐹𝑅) × (1.0 – 𝐸𝑜)] × 100 
  𝐹𝑅 = fraction of surface runoff, seepage, and/or deep percolation that is recovered.  
  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:29)  
 
Next is the second performance indicator  which is  irrigation uniformity . Nonuniformity in 
surface irrigation is caused because of differences in opportunity time of infiltrations . Suppose 
you have a field and at some parts of the field the infiltration is more while at some parts the 
infiltration is less, so this causes non -uniformity in the soil root zone. Non-uniformity is also 
caused by spatial variability of soil infiltration proper ties and non -uniform grades. So different  
amount of infiltration depth is caused by the infiltration properties of the soil  if there is a 
depression more infiltration is taking place at that point. The  non-uniformity  in micro -irrigation  
is due to Variation s in pressure caused by pipe friction and topography, variations in hydraulic 
properties of emitters or emission points , and variations in soil wetting from emission points. 
Generally, irrigation uniformity is calculated based on indirect measurements.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:11)  
 
1) Christiansen’s Uniformity Coefficient (Cu) for Sprinkler Systems  
Commonly used to describe uniformity for stationary sprinkler irrigation systems and is based 
on the catch volumes  
 𝐶𝑢=〔1−Σ│𝑋𝑖 − 𝑋𝑚│
Σ𝑋𝑖〕x 100 
Where, 𝑋𝑖 -measured depth of water in equally spaced catch cans on a grid arrangement 
(inch);  𝑋𝑚 - mean depth of water of the catch in all cans (inch)  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:44)  
 
The second indicator in the case of irrigation uniformity is lo w quarter distribution uniformity, 
this is applicable  for surface irrigation systems. So, if you see th e image above a furrow irrigated 
field or board irrigation field , water is flowing from head end to tail end and t he water depth at 
the head en d is more and then lowest  minimum water depth will be available at the tail end . 
The beneficial DP water is for satisfying soil moisture deficit SMD  
2) Low -Quarter Distribution Uniformity ( 𝐷𝑢) for Surface Irrigation Systems  
𝐷𝑢=𝐷𝑙𝑞
𝐷𝑎𝑣×100 
 Where, 𝐷𝑙𝑞 -average depth of water infiltrated in the low one -quarter of the field (inch);  𝐷𝑎𝑣 -
average depth of water infiltrated over the field (inch)  
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide  Time: 22:57)  
 
So, the third one is the emission uniformity for micro -irrigation systems. So, in the case of 
micro -irrigation systems , the water is  not wetting the field completely as in the case of sprinkler 
and surface irrigation systems, because if it is a dripper  wetting patches are seen due to  the drip 
irrigation system. So, here C u and D u concepts are impractical for micro -irrigation that is why 
here E u is used.  
3) Emission Uniformity ( 𝐸𝑢) for Micro -irrigation Systems  
𝐶𝑢 and 𝐷𝑢 concepts are impractical for micro -irrigation because the entire field does not wet.  
Uniformity of irrigation water is expressed by emission uniformity ( 𝐸𝑢) 
𝐸𝑢=[1−1.27 𝐶𝑣𝑚𝑛−1
2]𝑞𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑞𝑎𝑣𝑔×100 
 Where,  
 n = the number of emitters per plant;  𝐶𝑣𝑚= manufacturer’s coefficient of uniformity;  𝑞𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 
minimum emitter discharge rate at minimum system pressure at minimum system pressure 
(gpm);  𝑞𝑎𝑣𝑔= average em itter discharge rate (gpm)  
4) Coefficient of Design Uniformity ( 𝐶𝑢𝑑) 
      𝐶𝑢𝑑 = [1 – 0.798  𝐶𝑣𝑚×𝑛−1
2] ×100     
  Where,  
 𝐶𝑣𝑚 = Manufacturer’s coefficient of uniformity ; 𝑛 = the number of emitters per plant  
  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide  Time: 25:36)  
 
The third performance indicator  is the crop response to irrigation. So, the first one is the 
irrigation efficiencies, the second is the uniformity and the third is the amount of water you 
give and how the crop is responding to the water applied.  
Irrigation system performance and irrigation uniformity parameters discussed previously  
evaluate s the engineering and operational aspects of the irrigation system.  
The three most commonly used parameters for evaluating the response of the crop to water  are 
Crop water use efficiency , Irrigation water use efficiency  Water use efficiency  
1) Crop Water Use Efficiency ( 𝐶𝑊𝑈 𝐸):𝐶𝑊𝑈 𝐸 =(𝑌𝑖 –𝑌𝑑) 
(𝐸𝑇𝑖 – 𝐸𝑇𝐷) 
Where, 𝐶𝑊𝑈 𝐸 = Crop water use efficiency (Kg/ha -cm);  𝑌𝑖 = Yield of the irrigated crop 
(Kg/ha);  𝑌𝑑= Yield of the equivalent rain -fed crop (Kg/ha);  𝐸𝑇𝑖= ET for irrigated crop 
(cm);  𝐸𝑇𝐷= ET for a rainfed crop (cm)  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:41)  
 
2) Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE)  
𝐼𝑊𝑈 𝐸 =(𝑌𝑖 –𝑌𝑑)
𝐼𝑅𝑖  
{to characterize crop yield in relation to a total depth of water applied}  
Where, 𝐼𝑅𝑖= Depth of irrigation water applied for irrigation (cm), which does not account for 
irrigation application losses  
3) Water Use Efficiency ( 𝑊𝑈𝐸 𝑏) 
               𝑊𝑈𝐸 𝑏= 𝑌𝑖
𝑃𝑒+𝐼𝑅+∆𝑆𝑊 
Where, 𝑃𝑒= Effective rainfall (cm);  𝐼𝑅 = Irrigation applied (cm);  ∆𝑆𝑊 = Change in soil water 
content in the root zone (cm)  
 It neglects deep percolation losses, groundwater use, and s urface runoff.  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:56)  
 
Example 58.1:  
A stream of 150 lps was delivered from a canal and 110 lps were delivered to the field. An 
area of 2.2 ha was irrigated in eight hours. The effective depth of the root zone was 1.5m. 
The runoff losses t he field was 445 cubic meter. The depth of water penetration varied 
linearly from 1.5 m at the head end of the field to 1.1m at the tail end. The a vailable moisture -
holding capacity of the soil is 200 mm per meter depth of soil. Determine the Water 
Conveyance Efficiency , water application efficiency , water storage efficiency , and water 
distribution efficiency . Irrigation was started at a moisture extraction level of 50%.  
Solution:  
  1) Water Conveyance Efficiency ( 𝐸𝐶) =  𝐸𝐶 =𝑉𝑓
𝑉𝑡x100 
=110
150×100 
= 73.33%  
(Refer Slide Time: 31:13)  
 
2) Water Application Efficiency ( 𝐸𝑎) 
𝐸𝑎 =𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑓x100  
Water  delivered  to the plot =110 ×60×60×8
1000=3168 m3 
Runoff = 445 m3 
𝑉𝑠= 3168 -445= 2723 m3 
𝐸𝑎 =2723
3168x100  = 86%  
 (Refe r Slide Time: 32:43)  
 
3) Water Storage Efficiency (E s) 
𝐸𝑠 =𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑓𝑐−𝑉𝑎x 100  
𝑉𝑓𝑐 = 200 × 1.5=300mm  
𝑉𝑎= 300 × 0.5= 150mm  
𝑉𝑓𝑐−𝑉𝑎= 150mm =  (150 × 2.2 × 10000)/1000=3300 m3 
𝐸𝑠 =2723
3300×100 =82.52%  
(Refer Sl ide Time: 34:44)  
 
4) Water distribution efficiency( 𝐷𝑈) 
The a verage depth of water storage in the root zone  
𝑑= 1.5+1.1
2=1.3 m 
Numerical deviation from depth of penetration  
At the head end of the field = (1.5 -1.3) = 0.2m  
At the tail end of the field = (1. 3-1.1) = 0.2 m  
Average numerical deviation in the depth of water application , 𝑌= 0.2+0.2
2=0.2 m 
𝐷𝑈 = {1−(𝑦/𝑑)}×100 
={1−(0.2
1.3)}×100 = 84.62% 
So with this , I conclude this lecture , the irrigation system performance is be ing understood by 
3 cases. The first one is, system efficiencies , the second is uniformity and the third is crop 
response to irrigation water . So, in the next lecture , we are going to talk about irrigation 
economics.  Thank you.
