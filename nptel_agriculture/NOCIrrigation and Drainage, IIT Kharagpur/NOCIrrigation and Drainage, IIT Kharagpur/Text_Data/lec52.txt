Surface Drainage System Design - 2 
Friends welcome to lecture number 52, we are going t o learn about the Surface Drainage 
System Design 2. In the previous lecture , we talked  about hydrologic design and in this lecture , 
we will discuss the hydraulic design of  surface ditches . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:43)  
 
What does hydraulic desi gn mean ? It refers to the calculation of geometric elements of the 
drainage such as  width , depth , and side slopes. All these design parameters are estimate d by 
knowing the maximum carrying capacity of the channel.   
The geometric elements of the chann el could be rectangular , trapezoidal , parabolic channels , 
or semi -circular channels.  All these different shapes are available, but we will be focusing 
mostly on the trapezoidal channels.  
The design geometric parameters are bottom width and  depth. Besides  we are going to  estimate 
the stable side slopes  to avoid collapsing of the wings, the channel bed slope to maintain the 
non-erosive  flow rate , and also the channel roughness parameters . Manning‚Äôs roughness 
coefficien t is important to avoid channels covering and have enough channel carrying capacity . 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:29)  
 
The open ditch should be designed to fulfil l the following criteria. The first one is it should 
carry the design discharge that is the bare minimum. It should have stable side slopes and also 
longitudinal side slope s for non -scouring the non -stilting velocity.  
(Refer Slide Time: 02:59)  
 
How to estimate the design parameters for channel design.  The first step is to estima te the 
discharge. The design discharge is estimated using the rational method,  cooks method, and 
SCS CN method  or curve  number method  (lecture number 51) ; Any of these 3 methods can be 
used to estimate the design or peak discharge from the particular  wate rshed area .  Then the 
second step is to finalize the grade of the channel. So, the grade should have a maximum 
possible value without exceeding the permissible velocity.  
If you increase the grade  the velocity of flow increases and that will scour the cha nnels. And 
then the grade should not be very low. so that siltation may occur because the flow is not having 
enough carrying capacity to take out the  silt from the channels  and it will get deposit ed in the 
channels.  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:46)  
 
The table above Table 1 gives the maximum permissible v elocities in non -vegetated channels 
for different soil conditions . The first column is the canal material such as fine sand or sandy 
loam, silt loam, alluvial silts. So, based on the different soil type s; the value of  Manning‚Äôs n is 
given . In the second column the permissible or maximum permissible velocit y for clear water ,  
water with colloidal silts , and water with sand gravel  or fragments . So, this table will help to 
identify  the maximum permissible velocities by knowi ng the channel material.  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:46)  
 
The next  step is finding out the cross -section al area. So, for drainage purpose s mostly the 
trapezoidal section is used because it is easy to construct , and it can be maintained easily.  The 
size of the ditch can be determined using Manning‚Äôs formula. So, once we know the channel 
geometry or decided the channel cross -section, then we will be using Manning‚Äôs equation : 
ùëâ = 1
ùëõ ùëÖ23‚ÅÑùëÜ12‚ÅÑ 
By knowing the  Manning‚Äôs n and knowing the permissible velocity V, unknown parameters 
R and S will be estimated.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:57)  
 
The cross -section of a trapezoidal ditch is shown in  the above  figure , Figure1. Table 2 s hows 
the side slopes  for a particular channel. The first colu mn is the soil type :  peat and muck , stiff 
clay, clay and silt loam, sandy loam , and loose sand; for all these  soil type different side slopes 
are given for shallow channels ,(<120cm deep ) and deep channel (‚â•120 c m deep ).  
So for the trapezoidal channel , it has  a parameter ‚Äòb‚Äô the bottom width and depth ‚Äòd‚Äô we need 
to include a freeboard to accommodate siltation or other things ; generally , the freeboard can 
be up to 20 % of d once we put capital D, you can find out the top width according to D. So, 
capital D is equal to 1.2 times d  for 20 % freeboard . 
A berm is also  design ed like spoil banks. Spoil banks help in controlling the collapsing of side 
slopes and other things. So, the earth excavated from the open ditch may be placed on one or 
both sides  and the berm should be a minimum of 3 m. And spoil banks should be provided 
with flat side slopes of 3:1 on the channel side and 4 :1 on the bund side.

Example 52.1:   
Determine the efficient trapezoidal section of a drainage ditch required to carry a peak runoff 
of 1.4 m3/s. the channel is constructed in alluvial silts. The bed slope may be assumed 1/3000 
approximately as per exists topographical condition.

From Table 2 a side slope of 1.5:1 is selected.  
If b is the bottom width and d is the depth,

We know

Therefore,

From table 2, the side slopes for alluvial soils is 1.5 :1.

And then now we checking the velocity  
ùëÖ=ùê¥ 
ùëù= (0.66+1.5√ó1.091 )√ó1.091

=0.609 m/s 
And if you go back to Table 1 you will see 1.05 m /sec is the maximum permissible velocities. 
So, this velocity is within the permissible velocity  
Finally,  
Bed width = 61 cm  
Depth including free board = 1.30 m (included 20% free board)  
Side slope = 1.5:1  
So, that including 20 percent of free board and side slopes . So, this way will be designing the 
parameters for a cross -section trapezoidal cross -section.

ha watershed with a drainage coefficient of 5  lps/ha. The given parameters are: channel bed 
slope, S = 0.2%; channel side slope , Z = 1; maximum permissible mean velocity, V = 0.6 
m/sec and manning‚Äôs roughness coefficient, n = 0.025.

ùëâ = 1
0.025 ùëÖ23‚ÅÑ0.00212‚ÅÑ=1.79ùëÖ23‚ÅÑ 
Hence,   ùëÖ23‚ÅÑ=ùëâ
1.79; ùëÖ23‚ÅÑ=0.6
1.79=0.3352 ;   
ùëÖ=0.19407  
From continuity equation    ùëÑ=ùê¥√óùëâ 
ùê¥= ùëÑ
ùëâ= 0.25
0.6=0.4167  
Also,  
ùê¥=ùëèùëë+ùëßùëë2=ùëèùëë+1√óùëë2 
0.4167 =ùëèùëë+ùëë2 
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:12)

ùëÉ= ùëèùëë+ùëßùëë2
ùëè+2ùëë(ùëç2+1)12‚ÅÑ 
Substituting for b in R and writing R = 0.19407  
0.19407 = (0.4167 ‚àíùëë2)
ùëëùëë+1√óùëë2
(0.4167 ‚àíùëë2)
ùëë+2ùëë(12+1)12‚ÅÑ 
0.19407 = (0.4167 ‚àíùëë2)

ùëë+2.828  ùëë  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:04)  
 
0.19407 = 0.4167  ùëë
0.4167 +1.828  ùëë2 
So, after simplification , you get the quadratic equation  
ùëë2‚àí1.1746  ùëë+0.22796 =0 
This equation has two roots 0.9269 m and 0.2477 m.  
ùëè=(0.4167 ‚àíùëë2)
ùëë= 0.4167 ‚àí0.92692
0.9269=‚àí0.477   m 
ùëè=(0.4167 ‚àíùëë2)
ùëë= 0.4167 ‚àí0.24772
0.2477=1.434 m 
The first root is not feasible as it s substitution in th e area relation give s negative b.  
Hence, b = 1.43 m  ùëéùëõùëë  ùëë = 0.2477  ùëö‚âà0.248 ùëö=24.8 cm

0.519 m2 
The volume of earthwork per meter length of the drain for this cross -section is 0.519 m3  
So, this way you can estimate the geometric parameters of the trapezoidal  cross -sections or 
ditch. So, in this , the main design from hydrologic designs is calculated knowing the Q value.  
In hydraulic design knowing the Q value, you have to assume the trapezoidal channels will be 
used for designing the drainage ditches. So, know ing the Q and permissible velocity and based 
on the soil type  and the corresponding roughness coefficients in table  1 you will be estimating 
the channel dimensions.  
Then if the slope is  not given you have to assume or you have to a takes  slope for a particular  
soil type from table 2.  So, using this information you will be able to estimate the channel 
dimensions like breadth and depth, and also the top width and you can a put maximum of 20% 
as a free board to avoid any siltation in the channels. So, with these , I think we finished both 
hydraulic and hydrologic design in case of surface or drainage systems so.  
Thank you.
