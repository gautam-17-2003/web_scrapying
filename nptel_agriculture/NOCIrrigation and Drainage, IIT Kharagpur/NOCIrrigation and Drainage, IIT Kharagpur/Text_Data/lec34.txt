Pump Characteristic Curves  
Welcome to lecture number 34 whic h is on  Pump Characteristic s Curves . In the previous 
lecture , we have been talking about  the centrifugal pump  and its working princip le and 
also how to calculate the  head . And once you know the head and  by using the discharge , 
you can  estimate the pump  power required to lift the amount of wate r from  a water source ; 
when the water source  is below the centerline of the pump  and when the water source  is 
above the centerline of the pump .  
Now,  we will see what  are the characteristic curve s of a particular pump , just like human 
beings our character s are different , similarly , the pump which is manufactured by 
manufacturer  A is different from  the pump  with the same princip le, which is manufactured 
by the other  manufacturer . So, we need to study the pump characteristics  because it  will 
be useful  in sele cting an  appropriate pump for your desired  application . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 01:36)  
 
Before going to  the pump characteristic  curve s, there is a concept called cavitation . This 
is a common problem  in centrifugal pump s because  the cavitation itself  indicates  the 
formation of cavities  inside the impeller . So, how it is form ing inside the impeller ? when 
the impeller  rotate s and the speed increases that will  increase the fluid temperature . And 
when the fluid temperature increases  there is  a vapor pressure and the water particles or 
the water molecules  started  escap ing from the surface . Then because of vaporization , all 
the vaporized particles which are accumulated inside the eye of the impeller , which  is 
called  the cavities passes  from the low pressure at the eye  of the impeller  to the high 
pressure at the  end of the impeller  or at the end of the vanes ; all the bubbles  which are 
formed at the  center of the impeller  are going to burst . This mechanism o r phenomen on is 
called c avitation . So what is the implication of  that process ? So due to cavitation , the 
impeller  edges are going to  wear  then it is going to complete ly damage the impeller . The 
image in the slide above clearly shows how the cavitati on is going to form at the cent er of 
an impeller  when the impeller  rotates at  high speed , that causes the  increas e in the 
temperature of the fluid and  then that causes the  vaporization  of the fluid and all  vaporized 
particles formed cavity , so then when the cavity  transferred from low pressure to high 
pressure i t is going to burst . And you can see the bursting  effect in the image above  mostly 
at the edges .  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:45)  
 
And then  how to indicate the cavitation , so basically the cavitation co efficient is de noted  
as H sv, which is  the net positive suction head . We are going to see this  in the  next slide , 
but what exactly is the net positive suction head in the centrifugal pump . In order to lift 
water from the suction point to the center of the impeller , you need to  maintain a minimum 
suction . So the net positive suct ion head is  the minimum  pressure or the negative pressure 
required to lift water from the  source  in centrifugal . So, the cavitation coefficient  (σ) = Hsv
H. 
The cavitation coefficient is the critical value  at which cavitation will begin , it can be 
determ ined by testing the pump at constant speed and capacity at varying suction lifts . The 
effici ency increases for lower  σ values  if the cavitation coefficient is greater than  0.3, then 
that means the pump is operating successfully . The safe suction lift shoul d be 4.5 to 5 m 
for most of the pumps . So, in the picture  above you see  the pressure  variation at the suction 
point , eye of the impeller , and then the discharge point . The pressure at the suction point 
is going to decrease at the eye and then the pressure is going to increase at the discharge 
point. If t he low pressure  at the eye of an impeller is  less than the vapo r pressure of the 
fluid , then there is a problem of cavitation  which means the bubbles are  going to form . In 
the first image above the low press ure at the eye of an impeller is above  the vapo r pressure 
of the water and no  bubble  is going to form a nd no cavitation is going to taking place 
whereas , in the second graph condition , cavitation is going to  take place . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 08:27)  
 
Net positive suction head  (NPSH)  as introduced in the previous slide  is the pressure head 
needed at the pump inlet.  
Total NPSH = NPSH +  entrance and other frictional losses in suction pipe  
When pumping water level is below the pump inlet which is below the cente rline of the 
pump , 
NPSH = Atmospheric head -hss 
When the pump water level is above the pump inlet  
NPSH = Atmospheric head + h ss 
Where h ss is the static suction head  
 
 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 10:10)  
 
Pump characteristic curves  are a simple graphical representa tion of  the behavior  of a 
particular pump . Generally,  it is represented with  discharge , Q on the x-axis and y -axis is 
the head H, the other parameters are the power BHP on the y-axis and efficiency . The 
graph above shows 3 characteristic curve s of a partic ular pump , which has Q versus H and 
Q versus  power P , and Q versus  efficiency . These characteristic  curves are  different from  
one pump  to another pump . The usefulness of this  particular curve  is when you purchase 
a pump  you have to check the pump character istic curve and  see, whether the discharge 
you are  expecting and the head you  are looking  for can be obtained from the particular 
pump or not . For example,  in the graph above  your design  discharge  is suppose 16 lps and 
for this particular  discharge , you ca n have  around 29 m maximum head and then  
corresponding ly this will give the power required  and efficiency  of the particular pump . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 12:27)  
 
Next is  what happen ed to the characteristic curves , when you have  pumps connected  in 
series and parallel . When you  connect  pumps in series the Q or the final discharge will be 
the same , but the head is going to increase , you can increase the head  when you  connect 
two centrifugal pumps in series . 
Discharge,  
Q = Q 1 = Q 2

 H = H 1 + H 2 
Combine d efficiency,   
𝐸𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠 = 𝑄(𝐻1+𝐻2)

Where, H 1 = Total head for pump 1 ; H 2 = Total head for pump 2; BHP 1 = BHP of pump 
1 in kW; BHP 2 = BHP of pump 2 in kW  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:10)  
 
When the pumps are connect ed in parallel, the head s are the same  but discharge is 
combine d. 
 the head is constant,  
 H = H 1 = H 2 
Discharge is combined,  
 Q = Q 1 + Q 2

Pump performance  depends on the design and installation . The i nstallation  has practical  
influence and the design part , we need to consider in the design parameters , such as the  
diameter of the impeller , speed ,  power , head , and discharge . We need to understand all 
these parameters and how these are connected . These can be  studied  by using affinity law s. 
Affinity laws are standard expressions that define changes in pump capacity, head , and 
BHP when change is made to pump speed, impeller diameter or bot h

Where, n 1 = Speed at  which characteristics are known; n = desired new speed ; Q1 = pump 
capacity at n 1 rpm; Q = pump capacity at n rpm; P 1 = BHP at n 1, H1 and Q 1; P = BHP at n, 
H and Q

Combining the changes due to impeller speed and diameter  
𝑄=𝑄1√𝐷×𝑛

Where, D 1 = Diameter o f original impeller; D  = Changed diameter of impeller; Q 1 = pump 
capacity at D 1; Q = pump capacity at D; P 1 = BHP at D 1, H1 and Q 1; P = BHP at D, H and 
Q; D 1 = Diameter of original Impeller; D = Changed diameter of Impeller.  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:47)  
 
For example , if you  know the  diameter  and other parameters , then you can estimate , what 
are the  parameters corresponding to the  change in impeller diameter . 
So for example s o, we know that 𝑄
𝑄1=𝐷
𝐷1 . So, Q is given , D is given and what is Q1 for 
D1. So, D1 = 9 inch and D = 13 inch and  Q = 800 GPM. So  this is simple ,  math , you can 
calculate Q1.  
𝑄
𝑄1=𝐷
𝐷1=800
𝑄1=13
9  
𝑄1=9
13×800 ≈554 
Similarly , you c an calculate  the other parameters like head and power  
𝐻
𝐻1=(𝐷
𝐷1)2
and 𝑃
𝑃1=(𝐷
𝐷1)3
 
And then , you can also use a characteristic curve graph  if you have , by knowing the 
diameter , 13-inch diameter and you get  the 9-inch diame ter. The second question is to 
calculate the corresponding reduce d speed , similar  when you get a new speed, for  the 
reducing  the diameter  from  13 to 9 inch, you calculate the speed and you can get the 
reduced speed using the equations .  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time : 23:40)  
 
We also have other pumps  like propeller pumps . You might have seen the propellers  in 
boats  or airplanes . You can see the propeller  takes the air inside  or guides , the air inside . 
Similar ly, these pumps  work on  the same principle . It is a dopted f or high discharge and 
low head pumping  and it is  suitable to lift water from canals , rivers , and streams because 
all are surface waters , so you can easily use propeller pumps  to lift water . These pumps 
are very popu lar in rice -growing regions of S outh East Asia because the rice requires  
shallow water , so, it will be very  useful . The pressure head is developed mostly by the  
propelling or lifting  action of the  propeller blades  on water . So assembly will have  a 
propeller , diffuse r assembly , pump column , discha rge column , and the pump drive . The 
water which is  pump  due to the propeller  action  will be taken inside of the propeller and 
that will be guided t ill it finally reaches the discharge column . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 25:59 ) 
 
The next pump  is a mixed flow pump . So, the mixed flow  has both  the propeller a ction as 
well as  the c entrifugal action . So, it combines some  of the features of both vertical turbines  
pump that is , centrifugal pump and propeller pump . If you see the image of the pump 
above , first water will  flow through  the impeller  then it is guide d in the propeller it goes  
straight  then after that  it goes radial ly. 
It is applicable for  high discharge  medium head  like 2.5 to 10 m, it can be used extensively 
for drainage pumping, and  also pumping  from canals  and rivers . So, mixed flow pumps 
get more head  than, the propeller pumps because of the centrifugal  action , which is added 
in this pump . Head is developed partly by centrifugal force , because of the impe ller and 
partly by  lift vane s on the liquid . So, the flow enter s axially  and discharges in the axial  and 
radial direction . And, the main difference between the propeller  and the mixed flow pump 
is the construction of the impeller , which gives out ward thrust to the water in addition to 
imparting it an upward  velocity . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:22)  
 
Next, is a jet pump also called ejector pumps . This is  a centrifugal pump  that has an 
additional jet unit . In a centrifugal pump , it is practical ly applicable up to 7.5 m, if you  
want to have more head you need to hav e a jet assembly , that adds head to the centrifugal 
pump . So how this  jet works , supp ose, there i s an inflow  and there is a  jet with a  throttle , 
because of t he high j et negative pressure is going to  be create d. Centrifugal pump  is 
sucking the  water  and because o f that the water i s going in , but when you have a jet 
assembly this add ed negative pressure , which is created that will  induce more inflow to 
the suction, compared  to the regular  centrifugal pumps . 
There are two types  of jet pumps , shallow well jet pum ps and deep well jet pumps . The 
shallow well jet pump s assembly is  inside the pump  body  whereas,  in the deep well jet 
pump assembly is inside the well, just like  a submersible  pump . The suction lift increases  
from 6.5 to 8.5 m in case , of shallow well jet pump s where as the suction lift can go up  to 
50 m or 90 m in case  of deep well jet pump s. The e fficiency  in the jet pump s is mainly 
influenced by  the nozzle  throat ratio. For the small jet , the Throat is equal to the nozzle 
diameter , and the length of the t hroat is equal to 6 times  the throat diameter . So, these are 
the design , parameters we need to consider . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 31:06)  
 
The above slide presents the two types  of jet pump , one is the shallow well jet pump and 
deep well jet pump . In the  shallo w well , the jet assembly  is inside the pump , wherea s the 
same  unit when present inside the well , as shown above,  it is a deep well jet pump  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:35)  
 
And there is another spec ial kind of pump called Hydram or Hydraulic Ram , which works 
on the principle of water hammer . Suppose if the fluid is flowi ng in a pipe or anywhere 
you might have seen and if you  make a  sudden  impact  on the flow there is a residing  wave  
or it creates impulse  and that is carried backward , that sudden impact is called hammering . 
We are creating a hammering force  on the water flow and that creates a ripple  and that 
ripple  force can be used to lift  the water . 
This kind of  pump  is used in hilly areas , where  we do  not require any electricity , that is  
the advantage  of this pump . In hilly areas  water is lifted from  low heights to  high heights. 
If you see the source of water  supply  and irrigation , in the case of hilly areas  may be a 
stream  or irrigation canal . The s implicity of construction and automat ed operat ion of the 
hydraulic ram , make it ada pted in rural areas . 
So in the image above  basically  there  is a drive pipe , and a delivery pipe  and you want to  
lift water f rom the water source to the end of the delivery pipe. B ecause of th e slope , water 
is going to fall  from  the d rive tank to the hydraulic ram pump and  because of the high 
velocity  with which it is falling , when it hits  the obstruction at the pump , the flow recedes  
and there is a chamber  in the pump , which is water is stored inside , that water will be 
pushe d up and a valve  will open  and that opening  of a valve  take the water into the delivery 
pipe. So when the  valve opens up pressure will be decreased, and  then again that will  push 
this valve to closed  back . So, a back and forth  mechanism  is created, helping the opening 
of the  valve  and leaving water in the chamber . So, this is  an automatic ,  mechanism and 
no power is required , only water will act as the energy source  in this. 
(Refer Slide Time: 36:16)  
 
So, in the above slide , a broader picture of the hydraulic ram is shown . So, there are two 
valves the waste valve  (A) or impulse valve  and the delivery valve  (B), these two valves 
are very important in the functioning of  the hydraulic ram . When the flow, which  is coming 
is hitting th e waste valve , because it is a high flow  and you  are suddenly hammering it , by 
obstructing the flow  so, what happens initial ly, the waste valve  is open so some water will 
be wasted , that why it is called a waste valve . And then  because of the spring  action , the 
valve again pushes the fl uid into the system . So, when it pushes th e extra fluid  is going to 
lift the  delivery valve ; then it goes into the air chamber  so, because of this air  will be 
compressed  and when it  compress ed the fluid will be delivered to the delivery pipe and it 
will cl ose the delivery valve . So, when this is closed again , the fluid  from the source  is 
going to hit the waste valve again and then opening again  the delivery valve . So, this helps 
in the functioning of the hydraulic ram . 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:47)  
 
The advant ages of hydraulic ram are simple in construction and operation and it does not 
incur  any running cost , it utilizes  the energy of water available  freely and no fuel or 
electricity is required because this operates  basically on hydraulic ram  principle . It has 
only two moving parts , one is the waste valve  another is the delivery valve , both of which 
are lubricated by  the water itself so it does not  require  lubrication . It ensures continuous 
water supply as it operates through out the day and night , does not cause any po llution , 
since  it does not require  any fuel  but since  it is continuously operated throughout the day 
we need  to arrange a storage tank to store  the water . 
And then , the limitations here are a minimum fall of one  meter from the stream to ram is 
required , because that will help in  creatin g that particular flow  with high velocity. I t lifts 
about  10 to 20 percent  of the water being delivered . Since it works 24 hours a day , a storage 
tank is necessary  otherwise , it is going to  be waste d. 
So with this , the pump suction is completed . So, in this lecture , we focused on cavitation 
and then  pump characteristics  and then the other pumps  like propeller pumps , mixed flow 
pump s, jet pumps and then  ram pump , which is entirely  different from other pumps  which  
do not require  any electricity or power and works completely on  water hammer principle . 
So, in the next lec ture, we are going to  see some of the examples as tutorial s. 
Thank you  so much .
