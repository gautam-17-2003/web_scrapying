Lecture – 18 
Furrow Irrigation  Hydraulics  
 
In this lecture number 18  we are going to focus on the Furrow Irrigation Hydraulics again. 
So, previously by knowing the  advance curve we were  able to estimate the infiltration 
characteristics; like, Kostiakov infiltration parameters for a particular  field soil, but in this  
lecture we are going to see the whole procedure  to find out,  the advance curve by knowing 
the infiltration parameters. So, it is kind of a reverse of what we did  previously ; now, by 
knowing the infiltration parameter of particular field, how to estimate  or how to simulate 
the advance curve?  
(Refer Slid e Time: 01:11)  
 
The above flow chart  is clearly showing  the input data required here  such as  Q0, slope  S0, 
roughness coefficient n, shape parameters 𝜌1 and 𝜌2, Z req, this is  what we expect in the 
subsurface. And the cumulative infiltration we expect for a particular crop where a, k, and 
f0 are the  known infiltration parameters . So, our task here in this situation  is to find out , 
what would  the advanc e look like, how the advance is going to move from head end to 
field end  knowing the infiltration parameters? So, the first step is , we again focus on  
volume balance equation  where the  flow area field inlet  A0 is given as follows:  
𝐴0=(𝑄0𝑛
60𝜌1𝑆00.5)1
𝜌2
 
Then initial guess of r here is similar to the b , and b is the power function for waterfront 
advance  coefficient , if you remember in previous lecture . So, please, note that this r we 
are showing is equal to b  in previous lectur e. 𝜎𝑧 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜎𝑠 as previously given is  
𝜎𝑧=𝑎+𝑟(1−𝑎)+1
(1+𝑎)(1+𝑟) 
and 
𝜎𝑠=1
(1+𝑟) 
Before going into the details  let’s see how to solve an implicit function. W hen you have 
the implicit functions that means, the independent variab le is implicit , in that case, you 
cannot  solve the equation directly,  you have to use some numerical techniques like Newton 
Raphson  technique. So, suppose you have a function f (x), and  there is initial guess x 0. So, 
the new guess 𝑥1=𝑥0−𝑓 (𝑥) /𝑓’(𝑥0), this is Newton Raphson  technique so, every time 
you get some initial guess x0, find out what is  f(x) and what is f ’(x0) and you get  x1. Now 
you check whether this x1 is close to x0 or not, if they are very close like x0 - x1, ≤0.001, as 
tolerance  level , then you can stop the process, otherwise again this x 0 needs to have an other  
initial guess.  
So, that would be like x0 = x1, the x1 you get you put it  in place of x0, and find out this 
function values so now, you get new x1 and compare with the prev ious x 1. So, similarly  
with every iteration you will get  the new x 1 and this will be compared with the previous 
x1. If these two x1 and x 0 are very close, then we stop the iteration process and the guess 
will be the right answer or the right solution . This is finding out the solution in case of 
implicit functions. So, here in our case we have an  implicit function, basically we are 
looking for the advance functions  or advance curves that is ‘a’, and then,  there is the time 
also which is the u nknown function so, time and a.  The value of r or b is varied  in between 
0.3 to 0.9.  First let see what is the equation for advance time tL: 
𝑡𝐿=𝑇1=5×𝐴0×𝐿
𝑄0 
So, tL is taken as the initial guess you can also use  any initial guess, but in order to red uce 
the number of iteration, we use  tL. (Refer Slide Time: 06:43)  
 
If you remember the volume balance equations  where  T2 is  
𝑇2=𝑇1−𝑄0𝑇10.77𝐴0𝐿−𝜎𝑧𝑘𝑇1𝑎𝐿−𝜎′𝑧𝑓0𝑇1𝐿
𝑄0−𝑎𝑘𝜎𝑧𝐿
𝑇11−𝑎−𝜎′𝑧𝑓0𝐿 
You get a new T and T1 or tL is the initial T s o, let us say a function x, and here x is the 
time.  So, we are differentiating with respect to time, then  for a particular initial guess, 
substitute T 1 and you get T 2, and now you see whether T 2 is close to T 1 or not. If it is n ot 
close , again you go back to  update the T 1 with T 2, and do the iterations  till T1 is almost 
equal to T 2. We are targeting the advance points at the field end here  which is L .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:22)  
 
So, continuing if T 1 and T2 are very close, then you got the advance point at the field end. 
So now, next advance point  is at the middle  point,  or the  L/2. 
𝑡0.5=𝑇1=5×𝐴0×𝐿/2
𝑄0 
 So, we follow the same procedure for L /2 and then and same T 1 and T2.  So, one at the 
field end  L the other one is at the  L/2. So, we want to find T 1 by substituting x =L/2, we 
follow the same proc edure  - Newton Raphson  technique , and  same iteration  procedure, 
and finally, you get  T2. Now y ou get 2 advance points, and now find out the b value . So, 
initially you started by assuming b value, and f ind out at that particular b value what are 
the 2 advance points, now you  calculate back,  with the same b  and find out the new b. So 
now, check whether this b is close to the initial guess  of b, if they are not close , then again 
change b and find out t0.5 and t L, and estimate b now again compare , if they are  now close 
and finally, you will get the advance point at the field end  and advance point in the middle 
point and r value , where r is the coefficient. So, you get x 1, T1, x2, T2, and also you get t he 
power advance coefficient . So, this is the procedure  for findi ng out the advance point.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:05)  
 
Next is  computat ion of intake opportunity time , it is important  to find out what is the cut 
off time . So, here basically intake opportunity time  𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 is the time that is  required to fulfil 
the Zreq. So, for a particular crop we expect , 10 cm or even 20 c m of the Z req. So, at the 
field end we are expecting the vertical infiltration reaching  the Zreq point . Then the time 
can be obtained from modi fied Kostiakov equation using Newton Raphson  procedure as 
explained  earlier .  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:36)  
 
In a similar manner  make an initial estimate of 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 as 𝜏 𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑞 and c ompute a revised 
estimate as follows  
𝜏 𝑖+1
𝑟𝑒𝑞=𝜏 𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑞−𝑓(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞)
𝑓′(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞) 
𝑓(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞)=𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞−𝑘(𝜏 𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑞)𝑎−𝑓0𝜏 𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑞 and  𝑓′(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞)=−𝑎𝑘 (𝜏 𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑞)𝑎−1−𝑓0 
Compare 𝜏 𝑖
𝑟𝑒𝑞 and 𝜏 𝑖+1
𝑟𝑒𝑞 by taking the ir absolute difference . If they are equal or are 
within an acceptable error tolerance (say 0.5 minutes), the desired value  is obtained.  If not  
then again you have to update  the 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞  and find the function values and  redo the iterations. 
And finally, yo u get the solution  for 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 , so, that is infiltration opportunity time . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:57)  
 
So, once you get the 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 that is infiltration opportunity time so, the time of cut off  (tco) is 
equal to infiltration opportunity time plu s the advance time.  
𝑡𝑐𝑜=𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞+𝑡𝐿 
So, when water front reaches the length L  the time is t L. The Zreq at time t L is 0, now we 
have to deliver water until the  vertical infiltration reaches Zreq. So, 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 is the infiltration 
time you need to irrigate,  that is tL plus the extra time so, that will be the cut off time . The 
value of Q 0 should be adjusted  so, that the number of sets  is an  integer number.  The 
procedure is same to calculate 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 and tL as in Basin and Border irrigatio n system design   
(Refer Slide Time: 16:30)  
 
So, basically  the design parameters require d in simulation  purpose  of the furrow irrig ation 
system , are the Kostiakov -Lewis’s Infiltration Model Parameters ; Field Length ; Field 
Width ; Furrow Spacing ; Field Slope ; Shape Coefficient ; Manning’s Roughness 
Coefficient ; Required Application Depth ; Water Supply Rate ; Flow per Unit Width ; 
Duration ; Number of Furrows .  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:21)  
 
Next is the design procedure, some of the things we have already covered  in the flow chart. 
The design of a free drainage or  furrow irrigation system.  means, the tail end is free, in  the 
sense there is no dike at the end . So, water is flowing directly and causing the run off at 
the field end, So, in this case,  first thing is to collect the following required  fields data  or 
field characteristics . 
Field information’s  like length , width , area, slope and  manning’s  n; soil characteristics like 
texture , water holding capacity  and all other things  like crop, type of crop , design irrigation 
requirement this is very important, and  water supply - what is the total water supply 
available? and fur row characteristics like  spacing, bed to bed  spacing , shape  geometry , 
and shape parameters. So, these are the basic  field data required.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:41)  
 
And then  next is  to determine the furrow  geometry parameters using the equations 
explained  earlier , by knowing the  furrow parameters like a top width , bottom width,  and 
corresponding depths you can find out, furrow  geometric parameters  𝜌1and 𝜌2. And 
compute the intake opportunity time  as explained  in few slides back. S o, how to estimate 
Zreq and then compute the maximum  furrow discharge, that is Q max so, this is  based on the 
non-erosive  flow velocities and this is different  for different types of soil . Non-erosive 
flow velocity  is the maximum flow rates so that  flow r ate does not cause any e rosion.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:44)  
 
And if you see t he table  in the above slide , it clearly shows the non-erosive  velocities  for 
different soil types. Qmax can be estimated in manning’s  equation.  
And then  finally, the fifth step is to find out the discharg e by select ing the furrow discharge 
Q0 near to Q max. This Q 0 needs to be  near to Q max for the particular  furrow field, which 
results in integer number of furrows sets . The number of sets , 𝑁𝑠=𝑁𝑓−𝑄0
𝑄 
Nf is the number of furrows ; Q is total capacity  and number of furrows per set , 𝑁𝑓𝑠=𝑁𝑓
𝑁𝑠 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:48)  
 
Then next is  calculat ing the cross sectional area,  A0:  
𝐴0= (𝑄02𝑛2
3600 𝜌1𝑆0)1
𝜌2
 
Vmax needs to be check whether it’s really matching with the  non-erosive  velocity or n ot. 
If not again you have to change Q 0 so that V max should be non -erosive  flow rate : 
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 =𝑄0
𝐴0 
And the 7th step here is to assume an initial value of advance  exponent, let u s say r . So, 
from here onwards follow the flow chart  we just explained before. First select  an initial 
guess of b equal to 0.5  and we are going to find out 𝜎𝑧, and find out  time at the advance 
point in field end  and middle of the field. And then find  back th e b value, if the b value is 
close to  the assumed value then that is fine ; otherwise you have to change b value and redo  
or recalculate  the final advance point and a middle advance point. So, then you get the b 
value as well as the 2 advance points . 
(Refer  Slide Time: 23:50)  
 
So, this is all in the flow chart,  follows the flow chart  explained in the  previous slide s. 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:16)  
 
After follow ing the flowchart procedure  finally, you calculate r value, and now this r or b 
value will be compared  with the initial guess value.  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:40)  
 
And then  compute the cut off time  as explained  in the previous  flow chart  you will g et tL, 
and then  𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 by using the Newton Raphson  technique . Calculate the cutoff time  which  
is really required t o match the Z req.   
The 14th step is to compute the application efficiency.  
𝐸𝑎= 𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐿
𝑄0𝑇𝑐𝑜 
Then the application efficiency should be maximized considering the different values of 
furrow inflow rate subject to the limitation or eros ion velocity , integer number of sets, the 
availability and the total discharge of water supply, and other farming practices . So, at 
least 3 Q 0 value should be  tried, in order to identify a value that maximize E a. And same 
procedure needs to be repeated con structing representative values for infiltration 
parameters  and lateral irrigation during the season . This is for the first irrigation before 
considering for first irrigation  you got Q 0, the number of sets to be irrigated , number of 
furrows to be irrigated, and  then the other parameters like advance point , time of cut off 
and irrigation efficiencies . 
Similarly,  the same procedure, you can use for the next following  subsequent irrigations, 
because during a season you have a number of irrigations ? So, this is the first irrigation  
and sometimes you get 2 0 - 22 irrigations in a season but the number of irrigation depends 
on the crop . 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:37)  
 
So, that is all procedure so now the actual problem here,  
Design Problem : Design a furrow irrigation syste m for a field with the following 
information:  
Field length, L = 50 m,  Field width, W = 800 m, Longitudinal Slope, S 0 = 0.005, n = 0.04,  
 soil texture = silt, design irrigation requirement = 10 cm, furrow spacing, Fs = 0.8 m,  
 Furrow shape parame ters, 𝜌1= 0.305 and 𝜌2=  2.852,  
 Infiltration function parameters: k = 0.0019, a = 0.692 and f 0 = 0.00025,  
 available supply rate, Q = 4.5 (m3/min),  
 Supply duration = 24 hrs  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:14)  
 
Solution:  
 All the required data including the fu rrow shape parameters are already given.  
1. Calculate 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 to satisfy the irrigation requirement of 10 cm  
Zreq= irrigation requirement x F s = 10 cm x 80 cm = 0.08 m3/m length  
Assume an initial value of 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖 as 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 = 100 min  
Comput e a new value  
𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖+1=𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖−𝑓(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞)
𝑓′(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞) 
𝑓(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞)= 𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞−𝑘(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖) 𝑎−𝑓0𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖 
𝑓′(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞)= −𝑎𝑘(𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖) 𝑎−1−𝑓0  
(Refer Slide Time: 29:52)  
 
𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖+1=100 −0.08−0.0019  (100 )0.692−0.00025  (100 )
−0.692(0.0019 )(100)1−0.692−0.00025=115 .837 
 Since the new and initial estimates are not close, calculate a new value with 115.837 
min as a revised initial guess.  
𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑖+1=115 .837 −0.08−0.0019  (115 .837 )0.692−0.00025  (115 .837 )
−0.692(0.0019 )(115.837 )1−0.692−0.00025=116 .044 
𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞=116 .044 min 
2. Compute maximum furrow discharge (Q max)  
 The maximum non -erosive velocity for silt = 8 m/min  
𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 =(𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥𝜌2 𝑛2
3600 𝜌1𝑆0)1
(𝜌2−2)=(82.8520.042
3600  (0.305 )(0.005 ))1
(2.852 −2)=0.075 m3/min  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:14)  
 
3. After you get Q max and then  next the third step is to find out the number of furrows and 
number of sets. So, here  the following  equations are used : 
𝑁𝑓=𝑊
𝐹𝑠= 800
0.8=1000  furrows  
𝑁𝑠=𝑁𝑓𝑄0
𝑄= 1000  (0.075 )
4.5=16.66 furrows/set  
𝑁𝑓𝑠= 𝑁𝑓
𝑁𝑠=1000
16.66=60 sets 
So, total number  of furrows  is thousand and  16.66  furrows /set, this is a re al number but 
we are looking for integer. So, a new value of Q 0 < Q max needs to be selected iteratively 
such that both the number of furrows  and number of set are integer, that is the reason we 
follow the same pr ocedure by changing the sets . So, 10 sets, 8  sets, 5 sets, 4 sets, 2 sets 
one set, and the combination as show in the following table  
Sets Number of furrows/set  Furrow inflow rate (Q 0, m3/min)  
10 100 0.0450  
8 125 0.0360  
5 200 0.0225  
4 250 0.0180  
2 500 0.0090  
1 1000  0.0045  
So, multiplying sets and number o f furrows/set  should  give thousand  but the sets and 
number of furrows per set are different. So, with these combinations we find what is Q 0 
values,  and the first in this  example let us take  0.045 which is close to your  non-erosive  
flow discharge, that is  0.07 which is  within the non-erosive  flow rate. 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:33)  
 
Now, selecting the Q 0 value find out A 0 and then find out what is V max.  
Calculate the cross -sectional flow area at the field inlet (A 0) 
𝐴0= (𝑄02𝑛2
3600 𝜌1𝑆0)1
𝜌2=(0.04520.042
3600 ×0.305 ×0.005)1
2.852=0.00654  m2 
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 =𝑄0
𝐴0= 0.045
0.00654=6.88m/min  
Vmax< Maximum permissible velocity for silt, and thus chosen Q 0 is satisfactory.  
Now  find out the 2 advance  points using the flow chart explained earlier  i.e., tL and 0.5tL 
Assume an initial value of advance rate exponent ( r) equal to 0.5, rj= 0.5.  
Compute 𝜎𝑧= 𝑎+𝑟𝑗(1−𝑎)+1
(1+𝑎)(1+𝑟𝑗)= 0.692 +0.5×(1−0.5)+1
(1+0.692 )×(1+0.5)=0.72734  
𝜎𝑧′=1
1+𝑟𝑗= 1
1+0.5=0.6666  
(Refer Slide Time: 34:54)  
 
Compute the time necessary for flow to advance half the furrow L/2 distance, t L/2: 
a. 𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖=2.5𝐴0𝐿
𝑄0= 2.5×0.00654 ×50
0.045=18.180 min 
b. 𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖+1= 𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖− 𝑄0 𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖−𝜎𝑦𝐴0(0.5𝐿)− 𝜎𝑧𝑘(𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖)𝑎
(0.5𝐿)−𝜎𝑧′𝑓0(𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖)(0.5𝐿)
𝑄0−𝜎𝑧𝑎𝑘(𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖)𝑎−1
(0.5𝐿)−𝜎𝑧′𝑓0(0.5𝐿) 
𝑡𝐿2⁄𝑖+1=18.18− 0.045 ×18.18−0.77×0.00654 ×(25)−0.72734 ×0.0019 ×18.180.692×(25)−0.6666 ×0.00025 ×18.18×(25)
0.045 −0.72734 ×0.692 ×0.0019 ×(18.18)0.692 −1×(25)−0.6666 ×0.00025 ×25 
= 6.6083 min  
Repeat step b since the initial guess and new value are not within the acceptable limit. 
After an iterat ion a new value of 6.0135 min  was obtained, w hich is close to initial guess. 
Compute the time necessary for flow to advance L distance, t L: 
𝑡𝐿𝑖=5𝐴0𝐿
𝑄0= 5×0.00654 ×50 
0.045=36.361 min 
(Refer Slide Time: 35:05)  
 
𝑡𝐿𝑖+1= 𝑡𝐿𝑖− 𝑄0 𝑡𝐿𝑖−𝜎𝑦𝐴0(𝐿)− 𝜎𝑧𝑘(𝑡𝐿𝑖)𝑎(𝐿)−𝜎𝑧′𝑓0(𝑡𝐿𝑖)(𝐿)
𝑄0−𝜎𝑧𝑎𝑘(𝑡𝐿𝑖)𝑎−1(𝐿)−𝜎𝑧′𝑓0(𝐿) 
𝑡𝐿𝑖+1=36.36− 0.045 ×36.36−0.77×0.00654 ×50−0.72734 ×0.0019 ×36.360.692×50−0.66666 ×0.00025 ×36.36×50
0.045 −0.72734 ×0.692 ×0.0019 ×36.360.692 −1×50−0.66666 ×0.00025 ×50 
= 24.346 min  
Repeat step b since the initial guess and new value are not within the acceptable limit. 
After an iteration a new value of 23.737 min was obtained, which is clos e to the initial 
guess. Compute the revised estimate of advance rate exponent (rj+1) as follows:  
𝑟𝑗+1=ln2
ln(𝑡𝐿
𝑡𝐿2⁄)=ln2
ln(6.013
23.737)=0.5048  
The revised estimate (0.5048) of advance rate exponent (rj+1) is very clo se to the initial 
guess (0.50) of (rj), and hence the value of t L calculated is acceptable.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 35:45)  
 
So, you got advance points  and you got b at the end of the iterations , knowing the  advance 
time and then 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞which is already es timated, then you can find out T co which is  the cut 
off time from delivery point to point where you have to cut down the discharge  so, that the 
infiltration  depth will reach Z req. And then find out the efficiency once it is done . 
Time of cutoff, Tco ( min)   𝑇𝑐𝑜= 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞+ 𝑡𝐿 
=116 .04+23.74=139 .78 min 
Application efficiency, Ea as follows:  
𝐸𝑎= 𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐿
𝑄0𝑇𝑐𝑜 
= 0.08×50
0.045 ×139 .78=63.59%  
So, after finding out the efficiency , check the water availability  duration to  complete 10 
sets. So, for one set it is 139.78  mins hence for 10 sets  
Duration to complete 10 sets = 139.78 x 10 = 1397.8 min = 23.29 hr  
So, if you do not have any  rest time  in between the sets , in 23.29 hours’  irrigation is 
complete d which is  within the duration of water supply . So, repeat the step number 4 to 
13 for all possible inflow rate and set combination . 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:35)  
 
And finally, for each set or each flow rate  you get  efficiency , cut off time  and then you can 
tabulate the  whole thing so you get at a particular Q0, what is time of cut off? What is th e 
application efficiency? and  also the furrow sets and  number of furrows and number of sets . 
So now, you can select based on  maximum efficien cy or  combination  of furrow sets  to 
follow the design  of your irrigation . So, here the maximum E a was obtained for furrow 
inflow rate of 0.036  m3/min with  8 sets and 125 furrows per set. And T co cut off time is 
160.8  6 minutes.  
This completes the whole  irrigation design procedure, in th is lecture basically we focused 
on how to estimate the advance times by knowing the infiltration  parameters . So, in furrow 
irrigation designs the main target is to find out  the particular flow rate  that is 
sufficient /enough to irrigate the whole field by m aking, different sets or  that would be 
enough to give a maximum application efficiency . And the main key  computational  
method  in this procedure i s the Newton Raphson  technique, we will be using this technique  
in drainage case also.  
Thank you so much.
