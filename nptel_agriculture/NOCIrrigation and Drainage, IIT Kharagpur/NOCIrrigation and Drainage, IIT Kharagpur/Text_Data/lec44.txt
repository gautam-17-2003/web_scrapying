Drainage System Design  
This is lecture number 44 which is on drainage system design  and we will be talking about 
the drainages principles and some equations us ed in designing drainages. If you see the 
groundwater flow , it is very slow at first, it takes 10 to 12 m /day, but if you go deeper it  will 
take years. So, this is an entirely different ki nd of flow compared to open channel flow where 
the flow is not  having any interfer ence with the soil particles  and it is not a porous flow  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:23)  
 
So, flow through porous media is very slow . The Laplace equation is the basic principle used 
for groundwater flow. So, let us see how this has been derived. So, this is a combination of 
both Darcy’s equation and the mass continuity equation.  
Darcy’s equation can be written as  𝑞=𝑉×𝑖=𝐾×𝑖=𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑆 
K is the hydraulic conductivity, i  is the hydraulic gradient, dh is the head difference with the 
distance dS.  So, this is the same thing if you have a saturated soil column that has the pressure 
difference dh, and then you have the length dl or ds. And q is the flow that is taking place.  
And then for the three -dimensional system , the same equation can be written as  
𝑉𝑥= 𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑥,  𝑉𝑦= 𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑦, 𝑉𝑧= 𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑧 
For steady -state condition  (no change in storage ), the mass continuity equation can be written 
as  
𝑑𝑉𝑥
𝑑𝑥+𝑑𝑉𝑦
𝑑𝑦+𝑑𝑉𝑧
𝑑𝑧=0 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:48)  
 
So, combining the  two-equation above , putting the values of Vx, Vy, and V z, we get  
𝐾𝑥𝑑2ℎ
𝑑𝑥2+𝐾𝑦𝑑2ℎ
𝑑𝑦2+𝐾𝑧𝑑2ℎ
𝑑𝑧2=0 
For homogeneous and isotropic soil system, Kx = K y = K z 
𝑑2ℎ
𝑑𝑥2+𝑑2ℎ
𝑑𝑦2+𝑑2ℎ
𝑑𝑧2=0 
which is the well -known Laplace  equation for groundwater flow.   
(Refer Slide Time: 04:56)  
 
Exercise 44.1:  
A 1.2 m deep soil column consists of three layers, having 0.50, 0.4, and 0.3 m depth of the 
layers. The horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the l ayers is 0.20, 0.15, and 0.25 m3/m2/h, 
respectively. Determine the resultant horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the soil column.  
Solution:  
We know,  
KH=∑Kidi
∑di  
Putting the value in the equation  
KH=(0.20×0.50)+(0.15×0.4)+(0.25×0.3)
1.2  
𝐾𝐻=0.235 m3/m2/h (Ans.)  
(Refer Slide Time: 07:05)  
 
Next is  groundwater flow to drain, we have known the steady -state groundwater flow using 
the Laplace equation. So, you need to assume certain things while estimating the water flow 
or the discharge or drainage t o the drain pipe. In the image above you can see the ground 
surface  let us assume q is the accretion rate that is accumulate d and t he flow is taking place 
into the ground. And the drainpipe after sometime is making an equilibrium with the flow  
system.  To assume a steady -state problem, recharge has to  be equal to the drain discharge . 
Then flow lines are parallel to the drains  as shown in the image above. 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:36)  
 
Then the next is horizontal flow -based solutions , if you see the image above , in the actual 
condition it is going to the drain somewhere . The pressure at the phreatic surface or water 
table surface is atmospheric  and then you can see the flow lines . In the case of horizontal 
flow-based conditions the Dupuit -Forcheimer assumptions need to be considered  so, the flow 
lines are horizontal.  
So, here we consider these flow lines are horizontal  and then equipotential lines are vertical. 
The vertical equipotential lines and the flow velocity in the plane at all depths are proportional 
to the slope of the water table only an d independent of the depth of the flow system. So, here 
the flow which is taking place depends on the dh /dx, which is the slope of the velocity which 
is taking place or the flow which is taking place , or the drawdown curve . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:04)  
 
And the next is the design of the surface drainage system , the surface drainage is mostly plan 
based on the rational method.  
1. Estimation of Design Surface Runoff  
Peak surface runoff rate ( Q) using Rational method,  
Q = CIA 
Where, Q = runoff rate (m3/h)  
A = area from where runoff generates (drainage area) (m2) 
I = peak rainfall intensity (m/h)  
C = runoff coefficient (0.5 to 0.7)  
For design purpose s, the value of I can be taken from long -term (20 –50 years) peak rainfall 
records. 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:34)  
 
2. Design Considerations and Layout of Surface Drainage System  
So, the first thing is drain layout should be based on topography, the shape of the 
farm /catchment, direction of the natural slope , position of the farm buildings and roads  so that 
it does  not cross buildings or roads  and position /existence of natural depressions channels or 
river the drain base should be a little bit higher than the other river or depressions  so that water  
can go into the depression or river.  
The drain layout should be done with consideration of the minimum length of run and 
minimum crossing of the road  so that the construction cost will be reduced, and minimize the 
wastes of land and cost of culverts.  Land grading serves the purpose of surface drainage 
because if  the lands are not  level then the drainage system does not work properly
(Refer Slide Time: 13:14)  
 
The image above is an example of how the surface drainages are being constructed. For 
example,  you have  an office building , farm implement shed , weather station . And you want 
to construct a surface drain in this piece of land  by considering  these three places  and you 
need to also look at the slope.  The main drain can be seen in the above image whic h is taking 
place  and it is kind of a collector. And there are feeder  drain s that are not crossing the office 
building or the weather station. And sometimes the secondary drain and the tertiary drain  are 
also present, the tertiary drain drains to the secon dary drain, and secondary drains to the main 
drain. So, this way we need to check out the drainage plan system without crossing the office 
building , farm implements shed, and weather  stations.  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:50)  
 
3. Hydraulic Design of the surface drain (drainage channel)  
So, then the next  is the hydraulic design of surface drain, which  is similar to the design of an 
open irrigation channel. In the case of an open irrigation channel, so we will be looking into 
the peak runoff taking place from the p articular area and then design the dimensions. 
Similarly, here the capacity should be based on the design peak surface runoff from the 
drainage area. Using the rational formula, you will know what is Q peak. And the concrete 
channel both rectangular and tr apezoidal types can be easily constructed. So, for concrete 
channels , you can also go ahead with the rectangular , trapezoidal . Whereas for earthen 
channels safety or  stability is concerned so you have to construct  the trapezoidal type of 
channels.  
(Refer S lide Time: 15:46)  
 
Exercise 44.2:  
Surface drainage should be planned for a new agricultural farm to drain out irrigation tail -water 
and seasonal rainfall runoff. The m aximum rainfall intensity at the site in 20 years record is 35 
mm/h. The tertiary drain  would have to carry runoff from 4 ha land. The secondary drain would 
have to carry thrice of tertiary, and the main drain to carry discharge of four secondary drain s 
(of similar flow). Determine the design discharge capacity of the (a) tertiary, (b) secon dary, and 
(c) main drain.  
Solution:  
We know, Q = CIA 
Here,  
Drainage area, A = 4 ha  
= 4 × 10, 000m2= 40,000 m2 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:12)  
 
Design rainfall intensity, I = 35 mm/h  
                                              = 9.72× 10-06 m/s 
Runoff coefficient, C = 0.6 (as of agricultural land)  
Putting the values, discharge capacity for the tertiary drain , 
 𝑄𝑡 = 0.6 ×9.72×  10-06× 40000  m3/s 
  = 0.233 𝑚3/𝑠 
Discharge capacity for the secondary drain , 𝑄𝑠 = 𝑄𝑡×3 = 0.233 ×3  
                                                                                     = 0.7 m3/s 
Discharge capacity for the main drain , 𝑄𝑚 = 𝑄𝑠×4 = 0.7×4  
                                                                             = 2.8 m3/s(Ans.)  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:02)  
 
Next is the design of pipe drainage systems. So, in this system , the variables we will be 
focusing on are the discharge capacity let us say q , and water table depth to be maintained in 
the field relative to soil surface  let us say  H because this is where we will be we are looking 
for our root zone . And then other variables are  field drain age base width W, and the spacing 
of the land , L. These are the main parameters we will be considering in the pipe drainage 
system.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:08)  
 
And then, here for steady -state formula, steady constant flow occurs through the soil to the 
drain and discharge equals to recharges and h is constant. So after equilibrium whatever the 
q taking place that will be equal to the drain di scharges so that the h is constant and it becomes 
a steady -state. And then in the unsteady -state formula , all other parameters are varying, so the 
q may not be  the same as th e discharge , and h is not constant.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:50)  
 
And then drain spa cing, the drain spacing formula input are q, H, and W. From H and W, you 
can estimate h, W minus H  is h. And from q and h knowing the drain type and soil parameters  
you can estimate the drain spacing formula and then estimate the drain space  L. So, this is  the 
simple way to remember how to estimate drain spacing by knowing the q, H , and W and also 
drain spacing formula and other parameters.  In the real case,  W is the base width, D is depth 
to your base from the impermeable stratum.  If you see the flow lines  which are going vertical 
then after that it is going radial. But in the case of schematized , it is difficult to formulate in 
this way. So, in the case of formulations, it is vertical and then horizontal, the flow is taking 
place in three modes, one is vertical, horizontal , and radial.  
So, for radial flow the diameter is 0.7D  and the horizontal flow will be taking place at the 
depth of about L/4 that is from drain base to L /4 below  the horizontal flow. So, these are the 
assumptions  we need to make to sch ematized or model the drain spacing or to find out the 
drain spacing formula.  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:51)  
 
The flow patterns if you just go back and refer , the streamlines towards parallel pipe drains 
typically show a pattern. As seen previously, first i t is going vertically down and then 
horizontal and then radial  so, it shows a particular pattern. In the saturated zone below the 
water table , the water continuous more or less vertical downward  direction but soon turns into 
lateral flow towards the drain.  Towards the end of its path, the f low converges radially.  
So, here the relative magnitude of h, D , and L determines the type of flow. The vertical , lateral , 
or radial  type of flow  will be determined by knowing h , D and L. So, when L, is much  larger 
than h  and D, then this is predominantly horizontal flow ; when the spacing is equal to the 
distance between the drain base and the impervious layer, then  it is an extensive radial flow.  
When L is very less than h, h is the head at the middle of two drains, so th at is a distinct 
vertical flow that means  h is very high th an the spacing then it is a vertical flow.  
The horizontal depth may extend down to L /4, below the drain waste base we have seen 
previously. The radial flow zone is roughly confined to a circle with a radius of 0.7D. And 
total head loss  is  
Total head loss (h) = h v + h h + h r + h e 
Where hv is head due to vertical, hh head due to horizontal, hr head due to radial , and the head 
due to entrance  he. The entrance loss  is because when the water is  flowing into the drain there 
is an envelope material , hence the head  is influence  by the head loss due to entrance.  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:51)  
 
So, with this theory let us find out the different heads; vertical, horizontal, radial , and then 
entrance  that comprises the total head  and you can see the image above  is a schematic  of head 
loss. L et us say this is one drain and there is another drain somewhere ou tside, but you can 
see the middle point and the middle of the drain. And let us say the distance between the  two 
drain s is L since the distance from the middle point to the drain is L/2. 
There are 3  piezometer s install ed - piezometer 1, piezometer 2 , and p iezometer 3. These three 
piezometers are installed in such a way that  captures both vertical , horizontal , and radial 
flows . For example, here  piezometer 1 is installed exactly half of the distance that means this 
is the maximum h, near to that there is ano ther piezometer that is installed and the difference 
between  them will  give the hv head due to vertical  flow.  
If Dv is the distance or let s us say the maximum h here through which the vertical flow will 
be taking place. The vertical flow which is taking place from this column will be estimated 
using Darcy’s law,  
Darcy’s Law : 𝑞=𝐾ℎ𝑣
 𝐷𝑣 
ℎ𝑣=𝑞𝐷𝑣
𝐾  
hv is significant only when it passes through very poor permeable soil (heavy clay, impeding 
layer)  
hv increases when K d ecreases  
(Refer Slide Time: 29:23)  
 
Similarly, horizontal flow can be estimated. So,  if you see the image above,  the horizontal flow is taking 
place between 3 and 2.   
An analytical expression for this head loss may  be derived by considering the horizontal  flow Q x 
through a vertical plane of unit width.  
𝑄𝑥=𝑞 (𝐿ℎ
2−𝑥) 
𝑄𝑥=𝐾𝐷ℎ𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑥 
Where, dh = conceptual average thickness of the horizontal flow zone  
(𝐷ℎ= 𝐷 + 0.5ℎ) 
Equating these two expressions and solving the resulting differential equation for  
𝑥=0; ℎ𝑥=0  
and  
𝑥=𝐿ℎ
2; ℎ𝑥=ℎℎ 
So, with th ese boundary conditions and then equating and integrating, you get the solution as 
so first of all equating this, and then these are the limits and L 0 and L h/2 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:08)

ℎℎ=𝑞𝐿ℎ2

(Refer Slide Time: 32:37)  
 
And then  for radial flow, Ernst, 1962  has suggested the  following  equation.  
ℎ𝑟=𝑞𝐿
𝜋𝐾ln𝑎𝐷𝑟
𝑢 
Where aDr is an indicative geometric parameter, which varies with the location of the drain 
relative to the impermeable stratum  
u represents the wet entry p erimeter of the drain  
For example, if it is a circular ; 𝑢=𝜋𝑟0 because  in circular only half is wetted. And  in the case 
of the trench, u is rectangular and in the case of a trapezoid , u is the perimeter.  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:37)  
 
The head loss h e incurred in the flow -through pipe surrounds (envelope) and to pipe openings 
and the pipe  
The aim is to get h e=0, w hich is possible when the envelope K should be at least 10 times the 
surrounding soil stratum  
For h e=0 , K envelope  > 10 × Ksoil 
So, this is all in this lecture,  so three flows will be considered in  vertical flow and then lateral 
flow, and then radial flow.  The other thing is the drainages head which is taking place in 
between two drain points, it can be considered by summing up the vertical head, horizontal 
head, radial  head , and the entry head, combining all these heads, we will get the total head. 
To find  out these heads we will be using Darcy’s equation; and also linear interpretation in 
case of horizontal head  and case of radial E rnst equation, whereas in case of entry losses, so 
you will be installing a piezometer 10 to 20 c m, nearer to the main drain. An d then and the 
head difference or the water level difference in both drains will give h e. 
Thank you so much.
