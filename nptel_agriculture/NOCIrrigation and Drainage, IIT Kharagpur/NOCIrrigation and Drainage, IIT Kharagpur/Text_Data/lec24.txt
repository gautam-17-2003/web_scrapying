Drip Irrigation Design  
 
Hi, this is a lecture number 24 on Drip Irrigation D esign . So, we have s een some  design 
aspects in the previous lecture ; now  are going to  design  a drip irrigation system for a 
known  crop in this lecture . So, combining  the number of emitters  for a required application 
rate and covering the entire  given area  for a particular crop, and also the number of laterals , 
number of  sub-mains  or manifolds , and the main design , then the pump design  and pump 
power calculation . 
We will start with the emitter  specifications and design and finally, end up with the power 
required for a pump to operate  and to maintain the pressure and to  meet  the desired  
discharge at each dripper . 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:27 ) 
 
Here in this example , we are going to design a drip i rrigation system  for  banana crop  
Example 24.1: Design  a drip irrigation system for the following data  
Crop : Banana  
Spacing : 1.5 m x 1.35 m  
Area : 1 ha (  Let us consider it is a  square with 100 m  length  and 100 m  width ) 
Slope  : 0.3 to 0.4%  
Water Sour ce: Well  
Static Head : 10 m  
Pan Evaporation  : 12 mm/day  
Soil characteristics  
Clay soil  
Field capacity: 48%  
Wilting Point: 25%  
Bulk Density: 1.3 g/cm3 
Effective Root Zone Depth: 60 cm  
Wetted Area:  60%  (suppose you are  irrigating from  dripper ; the effectiv e wetted 
area is 60% that means it is not effectively irrigati ng the entire piece of land  or 
100% ) 
Maximum Pump Discharge: 2.5 lps  
The image above is a  rough sketch  of the  area, based on the given area  we assume the 
entire  field is 100 m length and 100 m width . Let us  plan a well at a particular  point  as 
shown in the sketch and the main line goes all the way from  the well through  the entire 
length of the field . Let us go into the detail ed calculation now.  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:52 ) 
 
The design steps  are as follows  
1. Calculation of depth of irrigation  
Pan evaporation Ep is given and if you multiply with the pan coefficients you will get 
the ET0 and then multiplied by crop coefficient you get  crop evapotranspiration  ETc . 
Let us say pan coefficients K p is 0.7 and K c for this particular crop is 1 
 ETcrop= ET 0√óK c = E p√óK p√óK c = (12) √ó(0.7) √ó(1.0) = 8.4 mm/d  
That means the crop requires 8.4 mm  of water every  day 
2. Volume of water to be applied : 
We have to replenish the amount required by the crop to meet the irrigation demand. 
So, the volume of water required at the individual plant is  
 Volume = Area √ó Depth  
               = (1.5√ó1.35) √ó (0.6) √ó (8.4) = 10.21 m3  
The effective area covered by the particular dripper is 60% hence 0.6  is the wetted  
area of one dripper .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 07:39 ) 
 
 
3. Number of Emitters p er plant  
 Number of Emitters per plant is to be selected (based on layout)  
 Say, One em itter per plant (4 l/h Capacity,  In the previous lecture we have seen the         
drippers have  different capacity  such as 2 lph, 4 lph, 8 lph. So, we are consider ing 
4 lph cap acity dripper)  
4. Irrigation Time  
 Irrigation time =Volume/Discharge rate  
                       10.21/4 =2.55 h say 2.5h  
5. Number of Emitters per lateral  
 Length of field =100 m  
 (Refer Slide Time: 11:22 ) 
 
Let us assume the main is g oing exactly half of the field that means 50 m , if it is going  in 
the center you have a lateral length of 50 m. The plant spacing  is 1.35 m  
Emitter spacing on lateral = Plant spacing =1.35 m  
 Number of emitters per lateral =50/1.35=37  
6. Discharge through one lateral  
Since the discharge through each dripper is known  and the number of drippers is known, 
so you can estimate the amount of discharge required for each lateral.  
 QLateral = 37√ó 4 =148 l/h   
We know the discharge through each lateral  now we have to find out how many  manifolds 
or how many laterals are required for the entire field . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:40 ) 
 
7. Number of laterals per manifold   
Pump Discharge = 2.5 lps = 9000  l/h 
 Number o f lateral that can be operated  = 9000/148 =60.81 say 61  
ÔÉº Breadth of the field =100 m  
ÔÉº Number of laterals along the breadth depend s on row spacing  
ÔÉº Distance between two laterals = 1.5 m  
You can  say 100 by 1.5 you get the possible number of laterals we can la y on one 
side 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:53 ) 
 
ÔÉº Number of laterals  on one side =100/1.5 = 67  
ÔÉº Total number of laterals = 67√ó2 =133  
ÔÉº Number of manifolds = 133/61 = 2.2 say, 4  is selected  for uniformity in layout  
Even if you take 3 what happens?  There  will be big s ize versus small  sizes so, instead 
of that , you can distribute equally. So, now, you have 4 fields or 4 segments  and since 
there are 4  uniformed layouts  So, the number of laterals per manifolds  is:  
ÔÉº Number of Laterals per manifold = 133/4 = 33.25  say 34  (manifolds means a grou p 
of laterals that can be operated at once ). 
Even i f you select  34 laterals you still have enough capacity to operate because  we were 
supposed to  operate 67.  We finalized 4 manifolds, and each manifold will have 34 laterals, 
and each lateral is going to have ar ound 37 emitters . 
So, let us go forward  and finalize the size of the lateral  
8. Size of lateral  
D-W eq      H1=KCLQm
D2m+n 
Let us assume a lateral of 12 mm diameter  
V=Q
A=2961  l/‚Ñé
œÄ
4(12mm)2=72.7 cm/sec  
Now, find out the Reynolds number  
NR= œÅDV
Œº= 8704  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 20:39 ) 
 
So, knowing the  Reynolds number,  so we can find out the friction factor .  
Since N R is between 2000 -105, use the Reynolds number (turbulent flow) equation to 
compute f  
f=0.32NR‚àí0.25=0.32(8704)‚àí0.25=0.033 
K=0.811(f
g)=0.811(0.033
9.81)=2.73√ó10‚àí3 
Now the next thing is the length  L, we know the lateral  length is 50 m , but since we have 
37 drippers and each the dripper will have a barb. So, you have to account fo r the head 
loss of each barb . So, there are some equations or graph s used to convert each barb  into 
equivalent length (as discussed in the previous lecture) . Based on the internal diameter and 
outer diameter of the barb and the thickness of the barb  we are goin g to estimate the 
corresponding equivalent length  and that length will be added to this total length of the 
lateral . 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 23:19 ) 
 
Correcting L in Darcy - Weisbach, Hazen - Willams or Scobey Equation for barb losses  
L= 50 m + (number of emission devices) C L 
So, if you see th e graph  in the slide above , by knowing the diameter of the lateral  the 
emitter connection loss equivalents  CL can be estimated . So, using the particular lateral  
diameter , e.g., if  it is large , you will get a corresponding CL in feet and the feet will be 
converted into  meters. Or you can also use the equations here for large  lateral pipe 
diameter,  ùê∂ùêø=0.91ùê∑‚àí1.935 based on the barb diameter or a barb specifications  
From the graph above for 12 mm lateral diameter  
CL= 0.6 ft = 0.18 m  
L = 50 + 37(0.18) = 54.86 m  
Now knowing the K, C, L and Q  value , m and n from the graph, H 1 is estimated  
  H1=KCLQm
D2m+n=(2.73√ó10‚àí3)√ó277778√ó63.32√ó(4.93)2
122√ó2+1 =4.08 m 
The calculating h1, F we get it f rom the table  above;  so, for a particular value of m  and 
number of outlet s (37) the corresponding F value, will be 0.347. M1 is the minor losses 
which is assumed to be 0  
h1=FH1+M1=0.347√ó4.08+0=1.415 m 
h1 value is t oo high; the maximum it sho uld be is 5% of static head  
 (Refer Slide Time: 26:49 ) 
 
Our static head  is 10 m so  5 % of 10 is 0.5 m  
Since it is high , we redo again the calculations by increa sing the diameter so that the 
friction loss will be less . Now, let us take 16 mm lateral  diameter  and redo the calculations. 
Calculate  Reynolds number from Reynolds number , you calculate  f, from f calculate  K. L 
you get from the  graph  again . So, using everything then you put it in the equation to find 
out H1 and h1 and see whether  the h1 is less than or equal to the  5 % of static head . So, we 
will do the same stuff again  by considering the n ew lateral diameter .  
Let us take 16 mm lateral  
V=Q
A=5032  l/‚Ñé
œÄ
4(50mm)2=40.90cm/sec   ;NR= œÅDV
Œº=6528  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:59 ) 
 
Since N R is between 2000 -105, use the Reynolds number (turbulent flow) eq uation  to 
compute f  
f=0.32NR‚àí0.25=0.33(6528)‚àí0.25=0.035 
K=0.811(f
g)=0.811(0.035
9.81)=2.94√ó10‚àí3 
Correcting L in Darcy - Weisbach, Hazen - Willams or Scobey Equation for barb losses  
L= 50 m + (number  of emission devices) C L 
CL = 0.33 ft from figure = 0.11 m  
L = 50 +37 (0.11) = 54.07 m  
H1=KCLQm
D2m+n=(2.73√ó10‚àí3)√ó277778√ó58.14√ó(4.93)2
122√ó2+1 =1.02 m 
h1=FH1+M1=0.338√ó1.02+0=ùüé.ùüëùüìm (<0.5 m)  
Acceptable  from Table for 37 outlets, Thus, Lateral Size = 16 mm  
Now, you finished the lateral part, and laterals are attached to the manifold. So, therefore  
you have to find out what is the discharge in the manifold   
9. Size of Manifold   
Qmanifold  = Q lateral√ó No. of lateral per manifold  
                   = 148  √ó 34 = 5032 l/hr  
  (Refer Slide Time: 30:28 ) 
 
So, knowing the total discharge from the manifold , similar to your lateral  design , assume 
a diameter and find out NR-value  f, K, H1, and h1  
Manifold design is similar to the lateral design  
Assume Manifold Diameter = 50 mm  
V=Q
A=5032  l/‚Ñé
œÄ
4(50mm)2=71.18 cm/sec  
NR= œÅDV
Œº= 35502  
NR is between 2000 -105, use the Reynolds number (turbulent flow) equation to compute f  
f=0.32NR‚àí0.25=0.32(35502)‚àí0.25=0.023 
K=0.811(f
g)=0.811(0.023
9.81)=1.92√ó10‚àí3 
L = 50 m  
H1=KCLQm
D2m+n=(1.92√ó10‚àí3)√ó277778√ó50√ó(83.86)2
502√ó2+1 =0.06m 
h1=FH1+M1=0.347√ó0.06+0=0.22m 
Head loss in manifold = 0.21 m                                 
  
(Refer Slide Time: 31:04 ) 
 
Head at inlet of manifold = H emitter  +H lateral+H slope+ H manifold  
                             = 10 + 0.35 + 0.18 + 0.21         0.35% of 50 = 0.18  
         = 10.74 m  
10. Size of main  
Length of main = 100 m  F (well location)  
Qmain = Q manifold  = 5032 l/hr = 1.4*10-3 m3/sec 
Assume main diameter = 50 mm  
V=Q
A=5032  l/‚Ñé
œÄ
4(50mm)2=71.18 cm/sec  
NR= œÅDV
Œº=35502  
Since N R is between 2000 -105 use the Reynolds number (turbulent flow) equation  to 
compute f (f = 0.023)  
H1=KCLQm
D2m+n=(1.92√ó10‚àí3)√ó277778√ó150√ó(83.86)2
502√ó2+1 =1.815m 
h1=FH1+M1=0.469√ó1.21+0=0.851 m  
 (Refer Slide Time: 33:03 ) 
 
11. Total Head  
Total Head = Head manifold inlet + H main+ H static+ H local 
                   = 10.74+0.851+10+2.16   = 23.75 m  
(Hlocal  is continued as 10% of all other heads)  
12. Pump Horse Power

So, with this , the drip irrigation  design  problem has been completed . The main thing here 
is finding out the  available capacity . You have to find out how many drippers can be 
operated and with a known amo unt of  discharge from each dripper , the number of laterals  
and number of manifolds that can be operated and finally, find out the head , and the 
discharge for each manifold , and knowing these two you can find out the pump required 
to operate the  particular manifold . Once you finish irrigating through  one manifold  it will 
be off and the manifold number 2 will be on , similarly , once the manifold 2 is done 
manifold 3 and manifold  4 will be operated simultaneousl y. 
Thank you .
