Lecture  - 29 
Well Hydraulics (Contd.)  
 
In lecture number 29 we are going to  discuss the  Well Hydraulics rel ated to C onfined 
Aquifer . So, in the previous lecture , we derived the equation of  water flow s to well , in the 
case of unconfined aquifers now we  will focus on  flow to well in the confined aquifer . 
(Refer Slide Time:  00:39 ) 
 
So, in the case of a confined aquifer , we have seen in the previous  lecture  that the static 
water level  is called  the piezometric  surface  because this is  a confined aquifer . And, the 
pumping wate r level  is hw and r w is the radius of the well . The drawdown curve is 
represented by 𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑟; R is the radius of influence ; b is the thickness of the aquifer and water 
is flowing horizontally to the well screen . The well is  fully penetrat ing to the aquifer  so 
we are going  to derive the equation for finding out the  pumping rate in the confined  aquifer  
or artesian wells . 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time:  02:04 ) 
 
So, let us see the derivation which is similar to that of an unconfined aquifer . Some of the 
assumptions are  
The a quifer is homogeneous and isotropic  and having uniform thickness ; that 
means,  K is not varying  in all direction s as well as with space . 
Pumped well penetrates through the entire  thickness of the aquifer ; that means,  it 
is a fully penetrating well .  
The f low of the well is in steady -state  
The top and bottom of the aquifer  are bounded by bedrock or im pervious layer  
because it is a confined aquifer  
The well is pumped , at a constant rate  
The a quifer is seemingly infinite in areal extension . 
So, using Darcy’s  law,  
𝑄=𝐾𝑖𝑎; 
𝑄=2𝜋𝑟𝑏𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑟 
So, water is flowing to the  well horizontally and with this  thickness  b. The surface area is 
2𝜋𝑟𝑏, because the water is going  flowing through the surface . So, similar to  the unconfined 
aquifer we are going to integrate  the equation .

The equation also called as Dupuit and Thiem equation  
Where,  𝑄=Discharge, m3/s;  𝐾 = hydraulic conductivity, m/s;  𝑏 = thickness of the confined 
aquifer, m ; ℎ𝑤= pumping water level, m;  𝑅= radius of influence, m;  𝑟𝑤= radius of well, m . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:04 ) 
 
Similar to  the unconfined aquifer , we can use the same equation to find out the  aquifer 
properties K and T. So, here we  are going to  install  two observation well  at distance r1 and 
r2 and after pumping we observe th e water level is h1 and h 2 for observation well 1 and 
observation well  2, respectively . So, you can find out 𝑆1=𝐻−ℎ1; similarly 𝑆2=𝐻−ℎ2 
So, from 2 observation  points , we get to draw down points . So, with the 2 draw down 
points , we are going to  get an equation for  hydraulic conductivity K and transmissivity  T. 
(Refer Slide Time:  07:12 ) 
 
So bring the equation back . 
𝑄=2𝜋𝐾𝑏  (𝐻−ℎ𝑤)
ln(𝑟2
𝑟1) 
So, if you have several  observations wells , you get different draw down points . So, the 
distances , from the cent er of the well to different observation wells are r1, r2, r3, r4 so, for 
every distance , the corresponding  draw down points can be calculated. Using these  data, a 
graph is drawn with  distance on the x-axis and draw down on the y-axis and you get  a curve 
as shown in the figure above  and for one log cycle , find out what is the  difference in 
draw down . So, here for one log cycle , the value is 2.30 then substitute that  in the equation . 
∆𝑆 correspond s to the difference in the draw down corresponding to the one log cycle . 
So, if you have th e above  curve it is easier to find the value of  T. From th e graph , ∆𝑆 is 
known and Q is known and you can find out the T. So, in this way you can  graphically 
estimate . You can also  use equations to sol ve K and T similar to the case of an unconfined 
aquifer .

A 10 cm diameter well penetrates a 10 m thick confined aquifer. The steady -state 
drawdown w as found to be 2.5 and 0.05 m at a distance of 10 m and 40 m, respectively 
from the center of the well. When the well was operated with a constant discharge rate of 
125 l/min for 12 h. Using the Dupuit -Thiem equation, calculate the transmissibility and 
hydraulic conductivity.

Example 29.2:  A confined aquifer has a source of recharge as shown in the figure. The 
hydraulic conducti vity of the aquifer is 50 m/d and its porosity is 0.2. the piezometric head 
in two wells 1000 m apart is 55 m and 50 m, respectively, from a common datum. The 
average thickness of the aquifer is 30 m and the average width is 5 km.  
a. Determine the rate of fl ow through the aquifer  
b. Determine the time of travel from the head of the aquifer to a point 4 km 
downstream  (assume no depression or diffusion).

Next is well loss , if you see the draw down curve  ending it is above  the pumping water 
level as show n in the figure above . The difference is due to some  losses . So, the losses 
could  happen  in 2 cases ; one is due to the turbulence in the well , and the other is due to 
the resistance  of a flow in the aquifer system . 
So, these 2 are causing the head loss or the variation in the pumping water level . Supposed  
if there is no well loss  the draw down curve will be in contact with the pumping level  
theoretically ; practically you will have a difference between the draw down curve and the 
pumping water level , let us  see how to estimate the well loss in case of  the aquifer ? 
(Refer Sl ide Time:  26:42 ) 
 
So, here in an artesian well , the total drawdown at the well Sw can be considered to be 
made up of 3 parts . 
1. Head loss require to cause laminar porous media flow called formation (aquifer) 
loss, 𝑆𝑤𝐿 
2. A drop of piezometric head required to sustain a turbulent flow in the region nearest 
to the well where the Reynolds number may be larger than unity, 𝑆𝑤𝑡 
3. Head loss through the well screen and casing, 𝑆𝑤𝑐  
𝑆𝑤𝐿∝𝑄 and (𝑆𝑤𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑆𝑤𝑐)∝𝑄2 
𝑆𝑤=𝐶1𝑄+𝐶2𝑄2 
Where, 𝐶1 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝐶2 = constant  
𝐶1𝑄= formation (aquifer) loss  
𝐶2𝑄2 = well loss  
So, in this lecture we focused on  water flow to a  well-installed in a  confined aquifer , we 
derived the steady -state equation for estimating the flow rate  or flow to well in a confined 
aquifer . And, also the  procedure to find out the aquifer parameters like transmissivity and 
hydraulic conductivity by installing  a series of obser vation wells . Then you get a graph  
drawing between  distances and draw down  and from the graph , you can use in the main 
equation and find out the transmissivity and the corresponding hydraulic conductivity  if 
you know the thickness of the aquifer . Then we  solve some problems and we formulate  an 
equation for  well loss . Well loss is due to the  aquifer , head due to the  screen openings and 
third is the head due to  turbulence in the well .
