Well Hydraulics  
Hi, this is lecture number 28 on W ell Hydraulics . In the last class , we’ve discussed on 
Aquifers Properties , and in this class , we are going to  see some of the well hydraulics 
mostly the  water flow to well in confined as well as in unconfined aquifers .  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:40 ) 
 
Before going to the details  let us  see the drawdown pattern in both confined as well as 
unconfined aquifers . In the case of a confined aquifer , you can see clearly in the image 
above that there is a well which is penetrating vertically down into the  confined aquifer . 
The confined aquifer h as a thickness ‘b’ and the initial  water level is shown in a dotted 
line as the  static piezometric level  which is the initial water level  before pumping . If you 
take the bedrock as datum  so, from bedrock to the  static piezometric level  the depth is h 0 
which  is the initial  static  water level . In the case of a confined aquifer , since the water is 
under pressure between two impervious layers  so, due to this pressure  the water level rises 
in the well . 
If you pump water continuously , then  at a particular time interval  the water level is going 
to deplete down . The depletion in the water level form s a curved as shown in the image 
above which  is called the drawdown curve . Let us take 2 coordinates , one is the radial 
distance  r and then the other is the head  h. 
These two components r and h  or the drawdown curve  vary with time  and also with the 
distance as shown in the picture above . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 03:19 ) 
 
At end of the end of this  drawdown , the change in the pressure with respect to  distance 
will be  0, because at this point the curve is tending to be flat or 0% slope . So, 𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑟=0.  
This drawdown is denoted with S and the drawdown is the difference between the static 
water level and the head . The drawdown ,𝑆 = ℎ0−ℎ. Where  h0 is the initial water level  
and h is the change in water level . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:24 ) 
 
The curve pattern  of the drawdown is similar to a cone  hence it is called the cone of 
depression . The aquifer is like a spongy material , which is initially saturated  and if you 
put a straw and take water from  the sponge  the water which is adjacent to th e straw opening 
will be removed  first, then after that it will remove water from the  extreme  corner  points . 
The same thing is going  to happen in the case of an unconfined aquifer , the aquifer is lying 
on bedrock or impervious layer  and there is no impervious layer on top, it is open to the 
atmosphere . The water level we are  seeing  is called the static water level or water table  
whereas in confined case s it is called the  piezometric  surface . Similarly , if you take water 
from a confined aquifer  you can see  the same kind of drawdown pattern . So, the distance 
between the static  water level and the pumping water level is called drawdown . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:01 ) 
 
Some of the definitions are important to understand the hydraulics of the well . 
The s tatic water level  is the water level at which water stands  in a well before pumping 
starts . It is called the water table in phreatic wells whereas,  the piezometric surface in 
artesian wells . 
The pressure at the static water level is atmospher ic. Suppose you have pressurized  force  
just like in firefighters trucks if you see  the water inside the pipes  are initially under 
pressure and based on the particular pressure  the water is going to eject into a burning 
building . The point where the water is reaching , in the end,  cannot eject  any further  so at 
this point the pressure  will be equal to the atmospher ic pressure  so, the same thing  here 
the water level will rise to the atmosphere . The s tatic water leve l is express as t he vertical 
distance from the ground surface to the water level in the well  
The p iezometric surface  is the height at which water will stand in a piezometric pipe open 
to the atmosphere  and extend to the con fine aquifers . The piezometric surface is the water 
level in the well of a confined aquifer  or on the water  level in  an artesian well or the water 
level in a flowing  well. 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:16 ) 
 
The rise of water in the pipe (ℎ) =𝑃
𝑤 ;  𝑃= pressure at the bottom;  𝑤= unit weight of 
water. The h eight at which water will stand in a piezometer or pipe open to the atmosphere 
and extent to the confine d aquifer  is called piezometric surface  
(Refer Slide Time: 09:56 ) 
 
Pumping water level  – when you pump water from the well , the water level  present in the  
well is called the pumping water level . The water level i nitially before pumping is called 
the static water level . Then when you started pumping and the water level  is depleted down  
and this is called the  pumping water level  so, this is a static water level let us  say h0, and 
the pumping water level is h.  
Then drawdown  is the difference between static water level and pumping water level  that 
is denoted with S, which means 𝑆 = ℎ0−ℎ 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:24 ) 
 
Tube casing in the boundary point of drawdown  and your drawdown should not go beyond 
the tube casing otherwise the casing which has perforations will be free  at the bottom  and 
your yield will be less and second ly there is a chance of sediments enter ing into the system . 
An area of influence  is the area that gets affected by the pumping of well . Suppose , you 
have a drawdown curve , if you take the top view  of the drawdown with well as the cent er, 
the boundary  of the area of influence  is a circular called the circle of influence .  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:45 ) 
 
Next is  the well yield , the well yield is the volume of water discharge from it per unit time . 
So, in-unit time the volume of water which is discharged from the well is called  well yield . 
The s pecific  capacity of a well is the yield per unit drawdown . So, for a unit drawdown , 
the yield is  denoted by the specific  capacity of the well .  
Open wells are dug wells  to water -bearing formation or aquifer . Open wells draw water 
from formation close to the surfaces  and their large diameter permits  storage of large 
quantity  of water,  generally , the diameter of an open well varies from 1.2 to 1.5 m. These 
open wells  are seen in  nearby irrigated fields where the water is being used for irrigations . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:53 ) 
 
In the lasts  presentation , we mentioned  two properties of leaky aquifers - hydraulic 
resistance and leakage factor . If you see the hydraulic resistance , which is the property of 
semi -confined aquifer  and is  denoted with C, 𝐶= 𝐵2
𝐾𝑏  
Where B  is the leakage factor and C the hydraulic conductive resistance that is in days , K 
is hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer , b is the thickness  of the aquifer . 
Suppose you have a n aquifer  with a leaky  layer and the bedrock is at the bottom  so there 
will be no leakage  but, water can go  up from the leaky layer on top and during recharge 
water can enter into the aquifer . So, here K is the aquifer  conductivity and b is aquifer  
thickness . And remaining C and B are properties of the semi -confined  layer . In this 
equation , we are not seeing any property related to the semi -confined  layer , C is the 
hydraulic resistance in days   
So, 𝐶=𝑏′
𝐾′. Where b’ is the thickness of the semi -confined layer  in m and K’ is hydraulic 
conductivity in m/day of the semi -confined layer and  that will give the  hydraulic 
resistance , C.  
When C is infinity , which  means there is  too much hydraulic resistance  then K  is 0 and  it 
indicate s that the layer is impervious  whereas, when C is equal to  0, K tends to infinity  
which  means, it is an aquifer . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:08 ) 
 
The next property is leakage factor  so, in the case of leakage factor , it determines the 
distribution of leakage into or from the semi impervious layer . The same equation if we 
use and solve for B  then 𝐵= √𝐾𝑏𝑐 
𝑐= 𝐷′
𝐾′ 
Where 𝐾= hydraulic conductivity ; 𝑏= thickness of aquifer ; 𝐷′= saturated thickness of 
aquitard ; 𝐾′= hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer  
B is generally determined by the pumping test . A high value of B indicates a  greater 
resistance because C is proportional to B; we have seen  that increasing the hydraulic 
resistance  increases the leakage factor , B. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 18:19 ) 
 
Next is the tube wells , tube wells are constructed by pushing a pipe below the ground 
surface through the different geological formation , which consists a water -bearing and 
non-water  bearing strata . The different geological formations sometimes may be an aquifer  
or not an aquifer and then again there is another aquifer . Tube well can connect to a single 
aquifer or multiple aquifers . There are two parts in the tube well; one is a blind pipe and 
one is a  perforated pipe or well screen. The pipe portion from the top to up to the part, 
which does not contain any perforation is called the blind pipe. The next part below is a 
thin pipe with perforations, which is required to collect the water through the perf orations.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 19:13 ) 
 
Filter points are popular in the deltaic region  because  the water table is very shallow . Since 
the water table is shallow you  do not  require  any blind  pipe; directly you can  use a screen 
pipe that means the whole pipe  has perforations.  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:33 ) 
 
A cavity well  is a tube well, opposite to the filter point s, cavity well  consists of a blind pipe 
only and does not  contain any screen pipe . Cavity wells are generally used in  clay soils . 
So, if you have a clay layer , that is  an aquiclude . The clay layer will  act as a support so, 
only the blind pipe is required , it creates stability to the pipe and also does not  allow 
sinking of the well. When you take water from the well , it forms a spherical bulb  (3D view ) 
at the bottom.  
So, a cavity well is a tube well that penetrates through a confined aquifer and does not 
consist of a screen  and the water penetrates only through  the bottom opening . As shown 
in the image above there  is a blind pipe , in the ground surface  or at the end of the pipe  
there is a co arse sand layer and on top of it  is a clay layer and then a  sandy layer . So, we 
are looking for the clay layer , once it hits the clay layer and  then water enters  at a critical 
velocity just like  a clear  bulb. 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:38 ) 
 
Next is the partial  penetrating well , in the previous case , the well was fully penetrating 
well, in the case of partially penetrating well , the water is  flowing through the well in three 
dimensional because the bottom is open partially , it is not fully pass through the  confined 
aquifer  so there is a possibility of the vertical flow down . A well-having a screen length 
less than the aquifer thickness  is called the partially penetrating well  and the flow is three 
dimensional . 
  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:43 ) 
 
What is the steady -state flow to  a well?  So, in the case of a steady -state, the pumping 
water level will be equal to the recharge . So, if the pumping water level Q1 is equal to Q2, 
which is recharge  or the water flow to the well. The change in velocity will be  0.  
 𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡=0 When 𝑄1≅𝑄2 we say the  flow is steady -state in the well . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 24:28 ) 
 
Then how to find out the  steady-state flow to well in unconfined aquifer ? An unconfined 
aquifer  is shown in the figure above,  the static water level or water table  can be seen clearly 
in dotted lines  and, there is the well . After pumping for some time t, the water level reached 
a point called pumping water level , and the corresponding  drawdown curve is formed as 
seen in the figu re above and is represented with 𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑟 0; r is a distance from the cent er of the 
well to the drawdown curve and then the corresponding head at th e point  r is h . H is the 
head at the extreme point or  the static water level table and R is the radius of influence , so 
with these parameters  let us  derive an equation to find out a flow into the well . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 25:50 ) 
 
So, here in the case of steady -state, there are assumptions : 
Flow is horizontal and penetrating the well radially . 
Well is pumped at a constant rate , Q  
The Dupuit  Forchheimer assumptions are valid  
So, using Darcy’s  law because the Q, which is  going in is equal to  that going out , so 
Darcy’s  law is valid  as well.  
𝑄=𝐾𝑖𝑎 
So, if you have  a well you  can see at the portion near the bottom , the water is flowing 
horizontally into the system . Then 𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑟 will give the drawdown curve and 2𝜋rh is taken 
because water is flowing to the surface  of the well s o, we have to take the surface area  and 
K is hydraulic conductivity .

Next is how to estimate  the aquifer properties like hydraulic conductivity  (K) and 
transmissivity  (T). So, once you have one parameter the other parameter can be estimated ; 
𝑇= 𝐾×𝑏. So, here to do that , install two observation wells  1 and 2  near the pumping 
well as shown in the  figure above . And, then in each observation well , we are going to find 
out the drawdown S1 and S2. So, using these  drawdown points , you can find out the K and 
T value s. So, let us  see how we can do that . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:45 ) 
 
So, here assume that there are 2 observations wells  installed at a distance r 1 and r 2 with 
drawdown S 1 and S 2, respectively . drawdown 𝑆 = 𝐻−ℎ ; H is a static water level and h 
is the pumping water level

A 25 cm diameter well in an unconfined aquifer is pumped at a uniform rate of 3000 l/min. 
The drawdown observed at 1m and 100 m distance from the center of the well is 8 m and 
0.4 m, respectively. Assuming the thickness of the saturated part of the aquifer  is 25m.

So, in this lecture , what we focussed is some of the important definitions in the case of 
well hydraulics . And, then how to  determine the flow to well during st eady-state and 
unconfined aquifer . We also solved a problem with the unconfined case  using the  
drawdown  at 2 observation points  and estimate  the aquifer parameters such as hydraulic 
conductivity and transmissivity . Thank you .
