Sprinkler Irrigation: Hydraulic Design  
Hi, welcome to lecture number 22 which  is on the Hydraulic  Design of Sprinkler Irrigation 
System . In the previous lecture , we studied  the simple design of  the sprinkler irrigation 
system s. Now , we will focus more on  hydraulics and how to design the whole system . For 
example,  the design of the nozzle , design of riser pi pe, design of lateral , design of main 
and sub -main , and pumping system , we are going to see the design of all components in 
this lecture . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:56)  
 
Since the water is ejected from  the orifice  so, we will be  using the orifice equ ation h ere 
for sprinkler  nozzle design . The discharge of the sprinkler nozzle  is given as follows:  
𝑄=𝐶𝑎𝑐√2𝑔h 
Where, Q = Discharge,  m3/s; ac=  Cross -sectional area of the nozzle or orifice, m2; g = 
Acceleration due to gravity,  m/s2; h = Pressure head, m; C = Coefficient of discharge 
which is a function of friction and contraction losses (varies from 0.95 to 0.96, for good 
nozzles)  
So, putting all the se values we get the discharge from the nozzle . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:08)  
 
The above equation will be us ed for designing the dimensions of the nozzle . For example,  
by knowing the discharge , the head and the correction factor , you can estimate the area of 
cross -section , ac. And since the orifice  is circular  so, Area, 𝐴=𝜋
4𝐷2 where D is the 
diameter of the orifice and D can be estimated . Next is the water spread area of the 
sprinkler . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:53)  
 
Suppose th ere is a sprinkler and the water spread area is going to  project  in a parabolic 
shape  from the side view , but if you see the top view  it is circular , this circular shape 
represents  the wet spot  area. The water spread area can be calculated using the Cavazza  
formula for rotating head sprinkler which is given as follows:  
𝑅=1.35√𝑑ℎ 
Where, R = Radius of  wetted area, m; d = diameter of the nozzle, m; h =  pressure head at 
the nozzle, m. So, knowing the  diameter of the nozzle  and pressure head at the nozzle  we 
can find out the diameter of the  wetted spot . The maximum coverage is attained when the 
jet emerges at an angle of  320 angle s. This jet angle is generally 30 to 320 and most rotating 
sprinkler s are standardized at 300 to get  maximum coverage . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:38)  
 
Next is the index of the jet breakup , this is ve ry important because  it ensure s the wetting 
of the irrigated area. S uppose , if there is no breakup of jet and there are 2 lines or  2 jets 
taking place on ly from the nozzle then  the middle part  between the two jets will be a dry 
spot and then the wetting front will not be uniform . Hence the breakup is very important 
to apply  water  uniformly  on the surface just like rainfall . The equation for the index of jet 
breakup is , 𝑃𝑑= ℎ
(10𝑄)0.4 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:52)  
 
Where h is the pressure at the sprinkler head  and Q is the discharge of the sprinkler .  
Pd > 2, the condition of drop size is good.  
Pd = 4, the condition of drop size is the best.  
Pd > 4, the pressure is being wasted.  
The w ater application rate is another  parameter we need to consider . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:40)  
 
The w ater application rate is given as  𝐴=𝑄
360×𝐴𝑊 
Where, A = Water application rate, cm/h; A w = Wetted area of sprinkler, m2; Q = Rate of 
application, lps . This is important while calculating the pump capacity and then pump 
power and all those things . 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:15)  
 
Since sprinkler irrigation  is a pressurized  system ; obviously, we are going to expect  
friction loss and other losses wh ile convey ing water from  the head  or main line to the last 
sprinkler . So, let us see what are the pressure component s we consider when you estimate 
the pressure at the main line. On the lateral , several sprinklers  are installed . In the image 
above, you see the pressure at the mainline which will be Hn, and the pressure is not 
uniformly distributed along the lateral. So, the pressure at the main is not equal to the 
pressure at the last sprinkler . There are several factors which influence it, it  could be 
friction inside the riser pipe or sprinkler head s and bends or other things . So, we need to 
consider all these things to estimate Hn. 
In the image above, there is Hr which is the head is due to  riser height th en there is  He 
which head  is due to elevation , suppose  there is a n elevati on so, you have to pump  more  
for the water  to reach the last sprinkler . Then after that, there is Ha which is the actual 
pressure head in the pipe  or lateral  and the last one  is due to the friction head loss . We are 
going to see all these things  while calculating the pressure head at the main because that 
is important to calculate the power required to pump a particular discharge . 
Hn = Head (pressure) at the main  
Ha = Average head  
Ho= Pressure at the farthest sprinkler  
He= Maximum difference in elevation between the first and last sprinklers on the lateral  
Hr = Riser height  
Hf = Friction head loss  
 (Refer Slide Time: 11:43)  
 
Average head H a, for the design in a sprinkler line:   𝐻𝑎=𝐻𝑜+1
4𝐻𝑓 
  Where, Ho= Pressure at the sprinkler on the farthest end  
 (Refer Slide Time: 12:37)  
 
If the lateral is on nearly level land or the contour, the head (pressure) H n at the main is,   
  𝐻𝑛=𝐻0+𝐻𝑓 
By solving for 𝐻0 and substituting in 𝐻𝑛 equation and making allowance for differences 
in elevat ion along the lateral,  
Hn= Ha+3
4Hf+3
4He+Hr 
Where, He - Maximum difference in elevation between the first and last sprinklers on the 
lateral, m;  Hr - Riser height, m. The term 3
4He is positive if the lateral run up the slope; 
negative if it runs down the slope  
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:59)  
 
Mainline pipe size - the function of the main line is to convey water to the  sub mains and 
the laterals and finally to the sprinkler s. Generally,  allowable  Hf in the main line is 3 m for 
small systems  and 12 m for large system s. The friction loss  in the pipe material is estimated 
using th e following  equation . 
  𝐻𝑓= 𝐾×𝑐×𝐿×𝑄𝑚
𝐷2𝑚−𝑛𝐹 
Where, L = Length of pipe (m, ft); g = acceleration due to gravity (9.81  m/s2); K s = for 
pipe material from standard table; K = Friction factor that depends on pipe material; Q = 
Flow rate (l/min, gpm); D = Diameter of pipe (mm, in); F = Friction factor (F = 1 if there 
is no ou tlet between up and downstream locations along pipe . So, the pipe is fully flowing, 
but there is no outlet here so obviously, we need not estimate any friction factor because  
the fluid is not going to move anyway so, friction will be 0 . 
c, m, n and K are values obtained from the table  given in the above slide which is  based 
on the particular equation  we use. There are  three kind s of equation s like Darcy-Weisbach 
equation , Hazen-William equation and Scobey equation , for different equations th e c, m, 
n and K value s are different ; you can  use the same equation  but the values are different .  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:08)  
 
Next is so, how to estimate this F value, F  can be determined as follows : 
When the distance from the pipeline to the first outlet equals the outlet spacing  
  𝐹= 1
𝑚+1+1
2𝑁+√𝑚−1
6𝑁2 
When the distance to th e first outlet is half of the outlet spacing  
 𝐹=1
2𝑁−1+2
(2𝑁−1)𝑁𝑚(∑(𝑁−𝑖)𝑚𝑁−1
𝑖=1) 
Where, m and n = appropriate m and n values in Head loss equations Table (previous 
slide); N = Number of sprinklers . So, this way you get  capital F value  and then finally, 
once you estimate the head present in the main line and the total  discharge capacity of the 
system  then the pumping capacity or pump power will be estimated . 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:09)  
 
Pumps and power units  - the maximum total head against  which  the pump is working  is  
𝐻𝑡=𝐻𝑛+𝐻𝑚+𝐻𝑗+𝐻𝑠 
Where, 𝐻𝑡=Total design head against which the pump is working, m;  𝐻𝑛= Maximum head 
required at the main to operate the sprinklers on the lateral at the required average pressure, 
including the riser height, m;  𝐻𝑚 =Maximum friction loss in the main and in the suction 
line, m;  𝐻𝑗= Elevation difference between the pump and the junction of the lateral and the 
main, m;  𝐻𝑠= Suction head (elevation difference between the pump and the source of the 
water after drawdown,  m 
 (Refer Slide Time: 20:01)  
 
So, considering all these things  you can estimate  what is the head at the pump outlet , what 
is the head at which we are going to pump from the  water source that is Ht total and 
knowing Ht and discharge  Q, you can estimate the pump power , P. 
𝑃=𝐻𝑡×𝑄
76 
Where Ht is in meters and Q in lps.   
(Refer Slide Time: 20:52)  
 
The above slide presents the tables available to find out  what is operating  pressure  by 
knowing the spacing between the sprinklers and main line and sprinklers and laterals and 
you can also know the application rates . This table will be different from manufacture to 
manufacture . The above table is  obtained from M/S NOCIL  Akola, Maharashtra  
manufacture . 
In the table , you can see two nozzle size s are given  since  there are the two  nozzle  outlets 
one is the range outlet and the other is the spread outlet  in case of  regular sprinkler or  
rotating head sprinkler . A nozzle diameter and operating pressures are given for this 
particular  sprinkler  and then the diameter of the spray is given and the n correspond ing 
discharge is given and application rates are based on the spacing . Different nozzles  will 
give different operating pressures and the discharg e can be calculate d from the  application 
rates . The fir st table is for high -pressure models and the other is for low-pressure  models .

Design a sprinkler irrigation system to irrigate 5 ha Wheat crop;  Assume the following  
 Soil type= silt loam  
Infiltration rate at field capacity     = 1.25 cm/hr  
Water holding capacity                    = 0.15  
Root zone depth                                = 1.5 m  
Daily consumptive use rate              = 0.6 cm/d  
Sprinkler type                                   = Rotating over head  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:35)  
 
Solution:  
 Step I  
 Total water holding capacity of the soil = 0.15 x 1.5 = 22.5cm  
 Let the water be applied at 50% depletion, hence the depth of water to be applied  
= 0.50 x 22.5 = 11.25cm  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:31)  
 
Step II  
Let the water application efficiency b e 90 % 
Depth of water to be supplied = 11.25 / 0.9 = 12.5 cm  
  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:51)  
 
Step III  
 For daily consumptive use rate of 0.60 cm  
 Irrigation interval = 11.25 / 0.6 = 19 days  
 In a period of 19 days, 12.5 cm of wat er is to be applied on an area of 5 ha. Hence assuming 
10 h of pumping per day, the sprinkler system capacity would be  
  =5×104×12.5×10−2
19×10×3600            = 0.009 m3s-1 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:18)  
 
Step IV  
 Take Spacing of lateral ( Sm) = 18 m  
 The s pacing of Sprinklers in lateral ( Sl) = 12 m  
 This selection is made after considering the following:  
Operating pressure of nozzle         = 2.5 kg/cm2 
Maximum application rate             = 1.25 cm/h  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:56)  
 
We can visit the table  earlier h ere.  
From the manufacturer’s M/S NOCIL, Akola chart ,  
For the spacing of 12 ×18, Nozzle size:  5.5563 x 3.175 mm  
Operating pressure:  2.47 kg/cm2 and  
The corresponding application rate for 12×18 spacing is:  1.10 cm/hr (which is less than 
the maxi mum allowable application rate)  
Because we know the application rate at the field capacity or the infiltration rate at the 
field capacity. The diameter of coverage is:  29.99 ≈ 30.0 m  
Discharge of the nozzle: 0.637 lps = 0.637 x 10-3 m3/s 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:59)  
 
Step V  
Total no. of sprinklers =  0.009/0.000637 ≈ 14 sprinklers  
Therefore 7 no. of sprinklers on each lateral.  
Step VI  
The sprinklers will be spaced at 12 m intervals on each of two lateral lines spaced 18 m 
apart.  
Step VII  
Total length of e ach lateral = 12 x 7 = 84 m  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:41)  
 
Next is  the maximum allowable pressure variation .  
Maximum allowable pressure variation = 0.2 x 2.47 = 0.494 kg/cm2 = 4.94 m  
Variation of pressure due to elevation = 2m  
Permissible head loss due to friction = 4.94 – 2 = 2.94 m  
Total flow through the lateral = 7 x 0.637 x 10-3 = 4.459 x 10-3 m3/s 
Considering DW (friction head) Eq.  
Reduction factor (F) = 1
3+1
2×7+1
6×72 = 0.333 + 0.071 + 0.0034 = 0.407  
Head loss due to friction  (Hf)=0.811×0.04×277778×84×(4.459×60)2
9.81×D5 ×0.407 
2.94=0.811×0.04×277778×84×(4.459×60)2
9.81×D5×0.407 
Hence diameter of lateral = 60 mm  
The head required to operate the lateral lines ( 𝐻𝑚) = 24.7 + 2.94 + 2 + 1 = 30.6 m  
 (Refer Slide Time: 33:20)  
 
Mainline:  
Frictional head loss in the main pipe line (𝐻𝑓) = 30.6 x 0.2 = 6.12m (20%)  
 Calculating in the same way as done in case of lateral  
                                 6.12=0.811×0.04×277778×84×(4.459×60)2
9.81×D5 ×0.407    or D = 69.10 ≈ 70mm  
Total design head (H) = Hm+Hf +Hj +Hs 
Where, Hj = Difference in highest junction point of the lateral and main from pump level 
= 0.5 (assume)  
Hs = Suction lift (20 m, assume)  
     H = 30.6 + 6.12 + 0.5 + 20 = 57.22m  
 The pump has to deliver 0.009 m3/s of water against a head of 57.22 m  
Hence, the cap acity of power unit for a pump with 60% efficiency  =0.009×57.22×103
0.6×75 
= 11.44 hp  
So, this way  we can design the sprinkler irrigation system 's main components  from the 
pumping system to the sprinkler  head . The main components here are  knowing the soil 
type, intake rate and crop type , we will be  estimating the application rates . Knowing the 
application rate  and using the chart you will be deciding  what would be the spacing  and 
from the spacing we are going to estimate the length , using the other head losses , friction 
losses elevation head and riser pipe height . 
So, we can estimate the  head loss  present in the lateral , head loss in main  and you will be 
estimating the diameter using the Darcy-Weisbach equation , Hazen-William equation , or 
Scobey equation . So, knowing  the diameter , length and number of sprinklers  and the total 
head in the system you will be estimating the power required to operate the whole sprinkler  
system . 
Thank you .
