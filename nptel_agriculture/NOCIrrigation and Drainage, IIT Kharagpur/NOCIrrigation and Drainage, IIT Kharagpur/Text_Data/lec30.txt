Lecture – 30 
Tutorial  
This lecture is a tutorial, we are going to solve  some problems related to the lectures  we had 
this week on wells and well hydraulics.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 00:54)  
 
So, let us see the examples o  
Example 1 The thickness of a capillary zone above the water table varies_____________  
This was given in 2017 GATE exam.  
If you  remember the soil -water zone , intermediate zone , capillary zone , etc.,  which is attached 
to the water table. This capillary zone  is above the water table, the thickness in the sense  is the 
rise of the water, so it depends on  the pore size of the soil. Suppose, a smaller por e size versus 
larger pore size if it is sandy soils, the thickness is smaller whereas  in clay soil the thickness is 
higher, that means, it rises  higher. Because the smaller pores the capillary the surface tension 
is more and then the capillary rise will be  more.  
Answer:  Inversely with the pore -size of soil  
Example  2 A cavity well is a tube well which has _____________  
The cavity well does not have any screen pipe or strainer whereas , it can have a blind pipe  only.  
Answer:  no strainer or a blind pipe

Example 3 : The sum of specific yield, specific retention for an unconsolidated geologic 
formation is equal to it _________  
Answer:  total porosity.

Example 4 : Dupuit -Forchheimer assumptions are  used for analyzing groundwater flow in 
_______________   
Answer:  unconfined aquifers  
Example 5: T he capillary water is held in the soil due to the _______

Example 6:  A watershed of 100 km2 is underlain by an unconfined aquifer having a hydraulic 
conductivity of 15 m/day and a specific yield of 0.20. If 30 million m3 of water is pumped from 
this aquifer through uniformly distributed wells, the average drop of water table over the 
watershed i n meter s will be __________  (GATE 2017)  
Solution:  
Given,         A= 100 km2 
Q= 30 million m3 
specific yield = 0.20  
Change in groundwater storage = Area of the aquifer × Drop in water table × Specific yield  
30×106= 100×106 × Drop in water table × 0.2  
Drop -in water table= 1.5 m (Ans.)

Example 7:  A fully penetrating tube well in a 30 m deep confined aquifer with a hydraulic 
conductivity of 4×10-4 m/s has 50 L/s discharge. The drawdown and radius of influence are 5 
m and 250 m, respectively. Diameter of the tube well i n mm is ____________  (GATE 2016)  
Solution:  
Given,              b=30 m;    K=4×10-4 m/s 
Q= 50 l/s = 0.05 m3/s  R= 250 m

Example 8:  An unconfined aquifer covering an area of 50 ha has a hydraulic conductivity of 
20 m day-1 and a specific yield of 12%. After a significant rainfall event, the water table rises 
from 17 m to 14.5 m below the ground level. Assuming no abstractio n and outflow of 
groundwater during the recharge period, the amount of groundwater recharge contributed by 
the rainfall in m3 is ___ (GATE 2015)  
Solution:  
Given,         Area= 50 ha ; specific yield = 12%  
Change in groundwater storage = Area of the aquifer ×  Drop in water table × Specific yield  
= 50×10000× (17 -14.5) × 0.12  
Change in groundwater storage due to rainfall = 150000 m3 (Ans.)

Example 9:  In a falling head permeameter test, the initial head is 0.30 m. the head drops to 
0.10 m in 40 min. The permeability of a soil sample, 0.06 m high and 50×10-4 m2 in cross -
section area, is found to be 1×10-6 m/s. The size of the stand pipe in m2 is    
    (GATE 2011)  
Solution:  
Given,  
h1 =0.3  m ; h 2= 0.1 m ; t=40 min= 2400 sec ; L=0.06 m;  A=50×10-4 m2; K=1×10-6 m/s

Example 10:  An unconfined aquifer  is pumped at a constant rate of 10 L/s. Steady -state 
drawdowns measured at radial distances of 30 m and 60 m are 0.80 m and 0.70 m, respectively. 
The o riginal thickness of the aquifer is 30 m. Transmissibility of the aquifer is ______ (GATE 
2007)  
Solution:  
Given,  
𝑄= 10 𝐿/𝑠=864 m3/d  
𝑇=𝑄ln(𝑟2
𝑟1)
2𝜋 (𝑠1′−𝑠2′) ;  𝑠1′= (𝑠1 - 𝑠12 /2H) 
𝑇=864×ln(60

2𝜋 (0.789−0.692) 
𝑇=982.29 m2/d (Ans.)  
So in this tutorial , we covered  the problems from the confined aquifer, unconfined aquifer , and 
also hydraulic conductivity  problem. Remember the formulas in case of flow to the confined 
aquifer and flow to the unconfined aquifer. And also the how to estimate the hydraulic 
parameters, such as the  hydraulic conductivity and transmissibility in both confined and 
unconfined aquifers ok, by knowing the drawdown  values  ok. So, these are very important . 
Then another thing is supposing , how to find out the recharge  or the amount of water which is 
pumped from an aquifer when you have change d in you know drawdown, right or change in 
drawdown. So, that also we have covered 2 problems . 
So, work on these problems , steady -state would be enough for most of the  irrigation wells. So, 
in detail , the unsteady state  flow to the wells can also be studied  in the case of tube wells and 
pumps ; there is a  separate course on that . In this , we covere d only steady -state problems . 
Thank you.
