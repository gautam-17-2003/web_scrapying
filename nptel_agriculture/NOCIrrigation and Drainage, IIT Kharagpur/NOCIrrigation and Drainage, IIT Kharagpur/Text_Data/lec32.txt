Centrifugal pump: Basics  
This is lecture number 32  and we will be focusing mostly on Centrifugal Pumps.  Centrifugal 
pumps are a part of variable displacement pumps. So, in the variable displacement pump , the 
discharge Q varies inversely with the head. If you are going deeper that  means the head 
increases and the discharge is going to be less.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:24)  
 
Variable displacement pumps are classified as mixed flow, propeller, centrifugal, jet pump 
and airlift pumps. The centrifugal pumps are most common in pumping irr igation water or 
drinking water, that is why our focus is more on the centrifugal pump . Centrifugal pump s 
could be volute type pump s or diffus er type pumps. Volute pumps can be  single -stage or they 
could be multistage pumps and diffusive pumps could be a vertical turbine pump or 
submersible turbine pumps. So, here we will be looking into these categories  like volute and 
diffuser type, and then we are going to see some workout examples in the case of centrifugal  
pumps.  
  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:50)  
 
 
The centrifugal pump will have two parts: one is the rotating part called  the impeller the other 
part is the fixed part or station ary part  which  is the casing. So, once the pump which is the 
casing, has  been  initially filled with water called priming, then you rotate the pump and this 
creates high velocity at the center  and increasing velocity will decrease the pressure at the 
center . And that will create the suction at the center , and the suction at the center will pull the 
water from the suction and then delivers it to the outside through the impeller vanes.  
Spiral vanes can be seen in the image above which increase s in diameter from the center to 
periphery. The vanes or guides will help in throwing the water in centrifugal force and then 
that water will be collected in the discharge column . So, initially , water is going inside then 
the impeller is working, which  is going to throw the water through the discharge column . So, 
when the rotating part  rotates the water will be pulled  and the water will enter into the center  
of the impeller and then rotates and then finally the outflow is taking  place.  
So, here because of th e low pressure created in the center of the chamber water  goes inside 
the chamber and the n that rotation throws water radially outwards through the vanes of the 
impeller, and then that water will be collected through the chamber. The discharge point and  
suction point  are shown in the above image . So, the main principle here is  converting the 
velocity head into the pressure head.  
 
 
 
 
  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:51)  
 
The image above is a n impeller horizontal pump case , similarly , the centrifugal force causes 
the water particles to be thrown from the impeller into the casing,  as we have seen, and the 
forward flow through the impeller reduces the pressure at the inlet allowing more water to be 
drawn in through the suction pipe by atmospheric pressure. So the liquid passes into the casing 
wherein high velocity is reduced to convert  into a pressure  head.  So, when once it rotates the 
fluid which is inside the chambers is also going to rotate. And at the center , the velocity is 
going to increase (less velocity will have more pressure and less pressure  will have more 
velocity) s o, that tr ansports water from less pressure to high and then finally, once the water 
is inside it is going to throw  it outside.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:05)  
 
To understand this centrifugal force; here is an example: suppose if you have a bucket  of water 
  
that has the bottom closed and the top is open . So, when the bucket has water and if you rotate 
it as shown in the image above , the water which is present in the bucket will not escape  due to 
centrifugal force . And suppose in the same bucket there is  a hole at the bottom ; the water is 
going to escape  as a jet  because of the centrifugal  force.  
And suppose if you close this top of the bucket and having a hole at the bottom when you 
rotate it  for some time  the water is going to escape then after that no water which wi ll come 
out from the hole because there is no opening at the top of the bucket , that means there is no 
atmospheric pressure influencing on the fluid , that creates the vacuum  inside the bucket . 
Similarly in centrifugal force this kind of vacuum influence ta king the fluid from the suction 
inside, then you can get the continuous flow. If you have the top closed, bottom open but the 
top is connected to a pipe  there is a continuous water  supply;  in that case what happens even 
if you rotate it, water will continu ously go in and then you get continuous flow out. So, this 
kind of principle you can see in a centrifugal pump  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:40)  
 
Centrifugal pump is classifie d as follows:  
Based on the type of energy conversion :- 1) Volute type, 2) Diffuser/Turbi ne 
Based on Number of stages: - 1) Single stage, 2) Multistage  
Based on Impeller type: - 1) Open, 2) Semi Open, 3) Closed, 4) Non -cloging  
Based on Type of inlet suction: - 1) Single suction, 2) Double suction  
Based on Axis of rotation: - 1) Horizontal, 2) Vertical  
Based on Method of Drive: - 1) Direct connection , 2) With power transmission  
 
 
  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:23)  
 
The centrifugal pump  parts are shown in the slide above. The two basic parts are the rotating 
element  which  is the impeller and the station ary part which is the casing, then other parts are 
listed out in the image . The eye of an impeller  is the  center of an impeller then the shaft and 
other parts are seen here.  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:57)  
 
Next is the volute type centrifugal pump  which is shown in the slide above. I f you observe  
the image of volute type  from center  to delivery point , the radius is increasing from center  to 
the top, kind of like a volute . The fluid which is coming from the extreme point is due to 
centrifugal force  and there the pressure is high and toward the outlet , there is a low velocity 
and the pressure is going to increase . The losses like frictional loss and turbulent loss will be 
less when you have a volute type of opening . This is predominantly used  for irrigation , 
  
domestic purpose and drain age pumping. And there are no diffusion vanes, but the outer 
casing is a spiral . If you see the form of outer casing reduces the water velocity  by creating 
an equal flow of water it moves around the spiral. And the spiral  is sometimes called a volute 
or hence the name of the pump is volute type.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:42)  
 
Next is the diffuser type, the volute type is only used for the shallow case, but if you want to 
increase the pressure  there is a diffuser in between th e impeller and the casing as shown in the 
image above. Within the  diffuser, the re is an impeller, then the eye of  an impeller or the shaft . 
So, here in th e picture above if you see just as in the case of the volute type the fluid escapes 
through the vanes . The pressure  profile  also can be seen in the image above  initially , the 
pressure is less , then after that pressure is increasing  and then suddenly it is going to escape 
through the diffusers.  A diffuser  is a fixed unit  as the casing . 
(Refer Slide Time: 6:18) 
 
  
In the image above you can see the diffuser case  with multiple diffusion vane s surround ing the 
rotating impeller , you can see the impeller,  impeller vanes and the diffuser vanes . Water is 
released from the center  of the impeller it spins outward as an imp eller rotates.  Water initially 
comes through  the impeller vane and  then it diffuses out . Around the impeller , circumference 
are various diffusion vanes passages that gradually widen the opening into a circular or spiral  
casing.  The main role of diffusion vanes is to reduce the velocity of water slowly, thus 
transmitting velocity into pressure. Once in the outer casing, the water then circles or spirals 
around toward the nozzle, where it exits the pump.  
(Refer Slide  Time: 15:50)  
 
And then the next  classification of  centrifugal pumps  is single -stage and multi -stage. In the 
case of single -stage pumps , the total head is developed by a single impeller. Whereas, in a 
multi -stage pump we have a single axis installed  with 1 - 5 impeller s. The discharge is the 
same  as in the case of a single impeller, but the head will be increased . 
(Refer Slide Time: 16:51  
 
  
Based on the  type of impeller if you see the  image above there are  different types of i mpellers. 
In the o pen impeller , vanes are free on both sides ; in s emi-open impeller vanes are free on one 
side and enclosed on the other . The c losed impeller has v anes are located between the two 
discs, all in a single casting  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:31)  
So, when vanes are free on both sides such as open impeller  it is less efficient , semi -open 
impeller  is more efficient than open type but less efficient than closed impeller. And there is 
a non-clogging  impeller  that will be used to pump slurries  or muddy water  that is th e reason 
is called the non-clogging  type.  
(Refer Slide Time: 8:10) 
 
Next, is how to estimate friction head in case of centrifugal pump? So, previously we have 
seen there are 3 formulas we used , one is the Darcy Weisbach equation , Hazen Williams , and 
Scobey equation . So, here we can use the Darcy Weisbach equation  
  
 𝐻𝑓= 4𝑓𝑙𝑣2
2𝑔𝑑 
Where,  
f= coefficient of friction for pipe (fraction), l= length of pipe (m) , v= velocity of fluid in pipe 
(m/s), d= diameter of the pipe (m)  
So, this equation will be us ed in estimating friction head loss in pipes,  i.e., head loss due to 
the energy required to overcome the resistance of pipeline fittings. The friction head exist s in 
both the suction and discharge of the pump. And it varies with the rate of flow , pipe size, 
condition of the interior of the pipe, and pipe material . Since we are using pipes an d bends  
the water which is flowing will have a loss in energy because of the friction head which is 
inside the pipeline inside the fittings  and valves. So, it is taken into consideration while 
estimating the total head and also to estimate the power required to pump from one end to the 
other end . 
(Refer Slide Time: 19:47)  
 
Example 32.1:  
Compute the head loss due to friction in a pipe of 7.5 cm diameter and 100 m length, when 
water is flowing at a velocity of 2 m/s. The value of f may be assumed to be 0.005.  
Solution:  
d = 7.5 cm ;  
l = 100 m ; 
 v =2 m/s;   
g =9.81m/s2 
Darcy -Weisbach equation 𝐻𝑓= 4𝑓𝑙𝑣2
2𝑔𝑑 
  
=4×0.005 ×100 ×2×2 
2×9.81×0.075=5.43 𝑚 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:19)  
 
The main two parts if you observe in the case of a suction side in a centrifugal pump  are called 
a foot valve and strainer . The foot valve  is kind of opening and has a major role in centrifugal 
pump operation, it has a flap valve so during suction the valve will open, so the water will be 
coming out continuously ; this is located at th e end of the suction pipe. So, during suction it 
opens , and when  the pump stops the flap is going to sit on the opening , closing it. So, that 
way the water would not go  in go  back to the  sump , this will help in priming .   
Frictional loss in pipe fittings and pump accessories:  
For strainer :  
ℎ𝑓=𝑘𝑠𝑣2
2𝑔   (ks=0.95)  
For foot valve : 
ℎ𝑓=𝑘𝑓𝑣2
2𝑔     (kf=0.8)  
In other word s, the specific speed of a pump is important and it is used as an index of the 
operating characteristic pump. And expresses the relationship between the speed , discharge  
and head  
𝑛𝑠= 𝑛𝑄12⁄
𝐻34⁄ 
Where, 𝑛𝑠= specific speed, rpm;  𝑛=pump speed, rpm;  𝑄= Pump  discharge, m3/sec;  𝐻= Total 
head, m   
 
 
  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:05) 
 
Friction loss can be estimated through the charts  as shown in the slide above . One is the 
equation we have seen and charts also can be used to estimate th e friction head loss. Charts  
are available to get friction head loss f or 100 m pipe length. So, knowing the discharge through 
a pipe q and its diameter  d, then you can get the corresponding friction head loss for 100  m. 
For example, you get h f for 100 m  for particular discharge s and diameter then you have to 
convert that or interpolate that for you r desired length l. Suppose your length is 10 meter s, so 
what is the friction head. So, that will be head loss h f by 100 m  into length l. So, this way you 
will get h f for the correspon ding length . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:30)  
 
The chart  in the above slide show s how to estimate the equivalent  pipe length  due to bends . 
  
Here different bends and pipe size s are given . So, for example, you have a long radius  elbow 
bend , the second column  represents the equivalent length of straight pipe ; so knowing the 
pipe size suppose 20 mm pipe size, so for radius  bend , you get 0.3 equivalent length . So, again 
we will go back to the table and for 100  m length  and we will find out the h f and for this 
equivalent length  like for example, 0.3 m  what is h f. So, for bends , we need two charts to find 
out the friction head loss.  
This is all for th ese lectures , in this lecture mostly we focus on the centrifugal pump  or the 
variable displacement pumps.  The variab le displacement pumps are broadly classified into 
centrifugal pump s, mixed flow pumps, axial flow pump s, jet pumps and airlift  pumps.  
Centrifugal pump works on  the velocity head be ing converted into pressure head. So, when 
you rotate the impeller; it is go ing to cre ate a low pressure at the center  and high pressure at 
the outlet point so that the velocity which is high at the center  will create a low pressure and 
more in the extreme points, that will lead to the water displacement from suction to the 
delivery.  
We have discussed how to estimate the friction head loss  by the Darcy Weisbach equation and 
then we also have the charts for knowing the friction head loss in a pipe over 100 m length, 
by knowing the discharge and diameter of the pipe. And similarly , for other parts like bends 
and valves , there is a cha rt available from that chart you will get the equivalent pipe length 
for a particular part. So, then, using that equivalent pipe length and your 100 m pipe length 
friction head loss you can convert or y ou can calculate the h f for a particular equivalent pipe 
length . 
In the next lecture , we are going to estimate the power required by a pump and solve  a few 
examples.  
Thank you.
