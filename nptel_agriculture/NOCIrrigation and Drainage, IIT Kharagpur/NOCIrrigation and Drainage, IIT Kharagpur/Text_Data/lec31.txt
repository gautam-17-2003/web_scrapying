Irrigation Pumps  
Hello, this is lecture number 31 on Irrigation P umps . In the last lecture that is lecture  
number 30, we were  talking about  irrigation well s, now  we will be ta lking about  how to 
extract water from the  well using irrigation pumps . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:35 ) 
 
Water lifting devices are used to lift water  from  river s or water which is stored 
underground from rainwater . Since we are  lifting the water it is called water -lifting 
devices . The broad classification of water lifting devices are manually operated , operated 
by animals  and electrical  pumps . 
Manually operated water -lifting devices are scoop, don, swing basket , Archimedean 
screw . Whereas  the Persian wheel , chain pump , rope, and buc ket, are coming under  an 
animal opera ted. Electrical  pumps are gear pump , centrifugal p ump, jet pump , or mixed 
flow pump and there are  other pumps  also available . The basic thing here is the 
classification  for example the scoop  will be tied at one end while the other end of a trough 
is in the water source , then by osc illating the trough the water  is filled in  from  the reservoir 
and whe n you keeping it down , the water will flow into the other end . Similarly , other  
things like the P ersian wheel are kind of a wheel that has buckets  on top of its wheel . So 
when it moves in the water source the bucket s will carry some water and  that particular 
water will be  thrown out at the top of the wheel and that will be  delivered to the nearest 
field. 
The gear pump s are positive displacement pump s, centrifugal pump s and jet pump s are 
variable displacement pu mps. The power that will be  used in this  categ ory is electrical 
power whereas, other categor ies will be using  manual or  animal  operated . The cost of 
operation  for the manual  operat ing category is  3 to 4 times ,  more cost than that of  animal  
operated whereas, animals  operated is  10 to 12 times costlier than electrical . So, 
comparative ly electrical pump s are cheaper than animal and manual operated . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:06)  
 
The principle  of operation of all these devices  are broadly classified here as : 
Direct lift  where the  water is lifted in a container , suppose you take a bucket and lift it with 
hand , that is called the  direct lift , you are simply l ifting from one place to another place  
and the device is called direct lift  devices . 
Atmospheric pressure  is when  water is lifted by atmospheric pressure  by creating a 
vacuum in a chamber  that sucks water up to the maximum pressure of 1 atmosphere . So, 
in the atmosphere pressure case , the negative pressure will be created at the suction point 
of the pump and th ere is a positive pressure  at the deliver y point of the pump, which  means  
less than atmospheric pressure at suction and more than atmospheric pressure  at delivery 
so, under these  circumstances , the water will be lifted . 
A positive displacement pump , involves the displacement of water from lower to higher 
level , just like if you have a  Persian wheel . The water which is taken out will be lifted up 
and then carrying back  so, it is positively going upward like  the reciprocating pump . The 
reciprocating pump also comes under this positive displacement  principle.  
Creating velocity head  - suppose you have a pump that is rotating at the center at  high 
velocity , that high velocity will decrease the  pressure  at the center . Then, if you can  
connect the cent er to the water source then because of low pressure  it is going to suck 
water and then if you have provision  this water can be  throw n out to the delivery . 
Using the buoyancy gas , buoyancy gas  creates  bubbles  that have less density , that floats 
up and then  that kind of lift ed the  water from bottom to top  
Using the impulse  or hammering force , suppose  there is water which is flowing and all of 
the sudde n you have a break or  if you create an impulse that will create  wave  or kind of 
oscillations and that can be used to  displace water from one place to another  place . The 
best example , in this case,  is a Hydraulic ram  also called hydram which work s on the 
principle of water hammer . 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:05)  
 
Overall irrigation water lift s are classified into indigenous  water lifts (manual  or animal 
operated ) and pump s that are electric ally operated . The indigenous water lifts are again 
classified as  low head , medium h ead and high head  if the head of the water source is at 1.2 
m, 1.2 to 10 m , and greater than 10 m, respectively . The scoop , don, water wheel are all 
low head s; the medium head  type is the rope an d bucket  which is animal operated , and 
then the high head is also rope and bucket.  
Pumps are classified into  positive and  variable displacement pumps . Positive displacement 
pumps are reciprocating pump s, gear pump s, helical pump s, etc. V ariable displacement 
pumps are centrifugal pump s, axial  flow pump s, mixed  flow pump s, jet pumps , etc.  
The positive dis placement pump displace s water from one place to another place without 
losing  water while transporting , or it carr ies water from  low head to high  head . So, 
discharge is almost constant even if you change the head; discharge is constant here . 
Whereas, in variable case discharge will vary  inversely  with the head ; if you increase the 
head  discharge is going to decrease . So, we are going to see  these positive displacement 
pumps and variable d isplacement  pumps in the following  sections .  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:46)  
 
A pump is  a mechanical appliance  used to increase the pressure energy of liquid to lift it 
from a lower to a higher level . It creates a low pressure at the inlet and high pressure at the 
outlet end of the pump  so, that create s suction at  the lower end and  at the delivery  head  the 
pressure head will increase . The principle of working  of a pump is  distinctly differen t from 
the indigenous water lifts , in which wa ter is lifted by displacing through buckets , water 
wheels , or screws  and also it does  not require  electricity . Whereas, other forms  of electrical 
pumps requires electrical energy . Pumps are divided i nto two basic groups , the positive 
displacement pumps and the variable displacement pumps . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:59)  
 
In the case of  a positive  displacement pump , the fluid is physically displa ced by 
mechanical devices like piston s, gears and cam s. The volume of water delivered is constant 
even if you take lower heads  because it is a positive displacement . The vo lume of water 
delivered varies  with the speed o f the piston  so it does not depe nd on the volume of water  
and does not depend on the head , but it depends on how fast the piston  is moving inside  
or on the  number of sto kes it  is making . It contains a large  number of  moving parts  and 
require s more  attention and maintenance . Whereas,  variable disp lacement pump s 
discharge varies inversely at the pressure head . In the graph  above  the discharge  is at the 
y-axis and the suction head is on the x-axis for the positive displacement pump . If you see 
as the head increases  the discharge is  not influenc ed much  up to a certain  point or certain 
head ; then after that , the discharge is going to decrease ; this is basically due to the 
atmospheric pressure . So all these pumps  are going to work when the suction is lower than 
atmospheric  pressure . Generally , 1 atmosphere is about  10 m equivalent  water height  
theoretical , but in practic e, if you  consider the losses  you may get  7.5 m or something like 
that. So, up to that  point , the discharge will be constant . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:47)  
 
Positive displacement pumps are broadly classified into  the reciprocating pump , rotary 
pump, gear pump , helical rotor pump and diaphragm pumps . The r eciprocating pump  is to 
and fro motion -based , it is divided into  a lift pump and force pump . The lift pump  is again  
classified into  the shallow well pump and deep well p ump which are  the single -acting 
plunger type and double -acting plunger type , respectively . To increase the discharge from 
the deeper  well then you need to  use the double -acting  plunger -type. And similarly , the 
force pump is classified into the shallow water pump and deep well pump , it is a single -
acting  plunger type for  the shallow  well pump but the deep well pump has both single -
acting as well as the double -acting case .  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:58 ) 
 
Reciprocatin g pump consists of a piston and plunger , you can see in the first picture above . 
So, it is a to and fro motion and it has two valve s, one at the bottom the  other at the  top. 
The crank is going to turn  and the piston  is going to oscillates  in a to and fro motion then 
when the piston  moves  away from the valves it creates su ction  inside the chamber  and this 
suction  pulls th e top valve  down  and opens up the bottom valve and water will enter th e 
chamber . When the piston  moves  towards the valves it will push the fluid through the top 
valve and helps  the bottom valve  sit in its port but opens  the top valve  and then finally, 
water will be coming o ut through the top valve . So, for one stroke  it takes water then for 
another  stroke it releases water , so, for two strokes it gives one discharge .  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:17)  
 
Reciprocating pump s could be lift pump s and force pump s. The lift pump s will be  designed 
to pump water from the source to the level of the  pump sp out only .  
The main difference between  lift pump s and force pump s is that lift pumps  will be used 
for shallow wells and force pumps will be  used for  deeper water s and the pump unit  is 
staying  inside the water source .  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:49)  
 
The theory behind the reciprocating pump can be expressed as follows   
Area swept by the pump piston: 𝐴=𝜋
4𝑑2 
Volume swept per stroke: 𝑉=𝐴𝑙 
Where d = diameter of the piston;  l = stroke (length of the piston)      
Volumetric efficiency: 𝜂𝑣𝑜𝑙= % swept volume that is actually pumped (coefficient of 
discharge)  
Actual Vol ume per stroke: 𝑞= 𝜂𝑣𝑜𝑙 𝑉 
Pump discharge rate: 𝑄=𝑛𝑞 
Where n = number of strokes per minute  
Slippage is  the difference between the swept volume and the output per stroke:  
Slippage :  𝑋 = 𝑉 − 𝑞  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:20)  
 
The force required to lift the piston:  
𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑛 + 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑢𝑚𝑝  𝑟𝑜𝑑 +  𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛  𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  
Let, 𝑎= area of the cylinder, m2; 𝑙 =  length of stroke, m; ℎ= total height through which 
water is raised, m; 𝑃 = force required to lift the piston (neglecting friction and weight of 
the piston and connecting rod), kg; 𝑤 = specific weight of water, kg/m3 
Weight of water raised in one stroke = 𝑤 𝑎 𝑙 = 1000  𝑎𝑙 
Work done in one upstroke = 1000  𝑎 𝑙 ℎ = 𝑃 ℎ 
   𝑃 = 1000  𝑎𝑙 
Hence,  P is independent of the diameters of the suction and delivery pipes, if friction is 
neglected.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 23:57 ) 
 
In a s ingle -acting  reciprocating pump , one discharge will happen with two strokes . If you 
see this picture  above  the two  stroke s will give one discharge . So, there is always some 
intermittent  gap, it is not a continuous flow . In the second picture above, an air vessel may 
be fixed over or near the delivery valve to provide a steady discharge. During the deliver y 
stroke of the piston, the air in the air vessel is compressed and during the suction stroke, 
the pressure of the air in the vessel maintains the flow of water through the delivery pipe; 
so this will  help in getting water continuously in case of single ac ting reciprocating pump .  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:27 ) 
 
Next is the double -acting reciprocating pump . So, here w hat happens ? if you see the image 
above there is a chamber with a suction and delivery  point.  At the center, there is a piston 
and the piston  moves  in a to and fro mo tion, then suppose the piston is  taking an out stroke , 
it creat es a suction at suction valve A and water will enter through  it, at the same time if 
you see the diagonal points will act the same way so, there will be discharge at valve B 
where th e valve will  open up and water  is going to de liver at the same time  the suction 
valve A  opens. T hese 2 diagonals will act opposite to each other , so if one diagonal valve 
opens up then the other closes up . So, in each stroke , you get a discharge point , not like  in 
the case of the single -acting  case the double -actin g case gives  one discharge  for one stroke . 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:48 ) 
 
Exercise 31.1:   
A single -acting reciprocating pump has a piston of diameter 10 cm and stroke of 20 cm. 
The piston makes 40 double strokes per minute. The suction and delivery heads are 5 m 
and 10 m, respectively. Find (i) the discharge capacity of the pump in l/min, (ii) the force 
required to work the piston during the suction and delivery strokes, if the efficiency o f the 
suction and delivery strokes are 50 and 60 percent, respectively, and (iii) the hp required 
by the pump for its operation.

Exercise 31.2:   
A double -acting reciprocating pump has a piston of 20 cm diameter and a piston rod of 5 
cm diameter which is on one side of the piston only. The length of the piston stroke is 30 
cm and the speed of the crank moving the piston is 50 rpm. The suction and discharge 
heads ar e 5 m and 10 m, respectively. Determine the discharge capacity of the pump in

And then o ther pumps are like the rotary pump . The r otary pump  works on the  principle 
of positive displacement pumps with a circular motion. Y ou can see the cams  in the image 
above, it has one or more rotary elements, generally , gears and cams/vanes, that revolve 
continuously within a fixed casing. When t he cams  are rotating , one is a drive cam  and the 
other one is  a slave  cam, the drive will  help the slave  cam, and then it transport s water by  
pushing the fluid into the  gap between , a fixed amount of water is  transmi tted from  one 
end to another end . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 38:43 ) 
 
And next is the gear type , gear type  is also similar to the  cam-type gears . It also works  in 
a similar principle . It is used in shallow sumps or pumping kerosene  oil.  
(Refer Slide Time: 39:06 ) 
 
In the case of a helical pump , the main mechanism here is the rotor and then a rubber  
helical rotor . There is a rubber  starter  that creates cavities when it rotates  because it is kind 
of a helical  rod. So, when this rotate s on a rubberized  surface,  it pushes the rub ber and at 
the same time pulling  it, which  creates the vacuum and a vacuum will help in pushing the 
water inside . So, sometimes this is called cavity pump  because it creates the cavities in the  
rubber starter . 
(Refer Slide Time: 39:55)  
 
The d iaphragm pump  is mostly used for  pumping muddy waters or slurries . It contains two 
diaphragms  at two ends, when one end goes in the other end  pushes out . It works s imilar 
to double acting  reciprocating  pump , for each  stroke , there is a discharge point . The two 
diaphragms  move in to and fro motion s. The moveme nt of the diaphragm on either side 
contributes suction on one side and discharge on the other side of the chamber  
So, this is all about  the water -lifting devices  we focus mostly on reciprocating pumps . 
Reciprocating pum ps are positive displac ement pump  which  positively displaces water 
from low  head to  higher head , these are  the plunger pumps or piston pump or gear pump . 
It is classified into two parts single -acting and dou ble-acting , in single -acting two -stroke 
will give one discharge  whereas double -acting one stroke wil l give one discharge . We have 
seen the working  of the diaphragm pump  it is a rubber  sheet , the rubber sheet will create  
flexibility and suction , and then th at will help in pulling the water .  
Thank you
