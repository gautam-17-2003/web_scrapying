Agricultural Drainage: Introduction  
Hello, this is lecture number 39 on Introduction of Agricultural Drainage . In t he previous 
lectures , we have talked about salt management and  what is saline soils and sodic soils, then 
after that , there is a n introductory concept on drainage.  So, today we are going to st udy 
agriculture drainage . In my introductory lecture , I have mentioned , drainage means remov ing 
the excess water from both surface, as well as subsurface of the soil for beneficial crop 
production.  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:19)  
 
The definition of drainage is the removal of excess water from the surface as well as from the 
subsurface and dissolved salts which are present in the soil from the land surface, as well as 
the crop root zone in order to improve the soil condition and enhanc e the crop production. 
The purpose  of drainage  is to remove  excess water that is ponding on the surface of certain 
soils or lands so that you can use that particular land for crop production.  And in the case of 
surface drainage removal of excess water from  the land surface by diverting it into natural or 
constructed surface drains. So, the soil is been trenched out from the surfaces and the excess 
water can be drained through the trenches from the surface.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:48)  
 
Similarly , the subsurface drains remov e excess water and dissolved salts. In the case of 
subsurface , there are two activities taking place; the first is to remove the surface water as 
well as the subsurface water or the excess water which is present in the root zone. And then 
the second is to dissolved salts that are present in the root zone through the ditches or 
underground pipes such that the water table is lowered  and salinity can be controlled and crop 
production can be increased. So, these things can be achieved wit h subsurface  drainage.  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:37)  
 
So, the figure  above shows a pond ed land surface and since there is no t much oxygen that is 
penetrating or passing from the atmosphere , the root system cannot get enough  oxygen.  So 
whatever oxygen which is in dissolved f orm in the water will be taken up by the plants and 
after that , no more oxygen  is remaining  because of the water layer which is on the surface, 
which  kills the plant. If the water table is just above the surface yo u have to lower it down by 
 
removing the water from the roots zone by providing tiles drains  as shown in the picture 
above . 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:05)  
 
So, what are the benefits of agricultural drainage? So, the main benefits are to facilitate  the 
early plo wing and planting ; if the soil is ponded we cannot use the machinery to operate but 
if you take out the excess water the machinery can be used to plo w the soil that will help in 
planting crops early.  
It improve s soil structure maintains productivity , soil structure will be improved by removing 
the excess water as well as it will be properly aerated . Increase the cropping intensity , so when  
the soil condition is good, you can go ahead with several  crops and also in different season s.  
Enhance the exchange a ir between soil and atmosphere that will  help in microbiological 
activity , so when the excess water is removed from the surface  the soil pores are free from the 
water and the atmosphere air can pass through the soil particles down easily and then the 
microbes which are present in the soil can extract or use the oxygen and that will be helpful 
for microbiological activity.  
Increases infiltration capa city; so, this will reduce  soil erosion. Suppose when there is  
infiltration  there will be less runoff and the erosion will be reduced .  
Reduces soil compaction and ease f arming operations , if there is water all the time the soil 
will be  completely wet  so when the implement or any agriculture machinery are operated on 
such lands  it will  influence the compaction of soils. So, removing excess water or drain ing 
the soil reduces soil compaction . 
Minimize the crop damage at the harvest time because so me crops are water -sensitive so if 
you remove water it minimizes the crop damage at the harvest time.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:00)  
 
And next are some drainage engineering terminologies.  Drainable pore space  is very 
important for example, initially , the water table is at point 1 as shown in the image above the 
pores are filled  with water initially, but  when you bring this water table down to water table 
2 by removing water through the drains then the saturated water wetting front moves to o. 
During  this process  of lower ing down water table 1 to water table 2, the pore space that is 
being used in  draining the water is called the drainable pore space.  
Drainable porosity  (𝜇) 
𝜇 =drainable  pore  water  
water  table  drop 
Suppose the water table drop is h and during the drop , d is the depth of water that is be ing 
removed  by a tile drain . So, 𝑑
ℎ will give the drainable porosity.  
Drainable porosity is also calculated as follows  
𝜇 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡 𝑦 −𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦  𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒  
So, since it is completely saturated initially and the total porosity is the number of pores that 
contain  water , then  the free water which is coming out due to  drainage can  be quanti fied. So 
knowing the total porosity minus the quantifying water which is coming from that point will 
give the 𝜇. So, that means the drainage water is free water  or gravity water, once the gravity 
water comes whatever water is left inside the soil  pores is called field capacity water.  So, 𝜇 
values of the field soils typically var y from 2 to 10 %.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:39)  
 
Drainage intensity or drainage coefficient  is defined as the depth  of water that is removed or 
is removed per day from the field for the successful growth of the crop.  
So for example , if you have a field  so, the amount of water that is drained per day is called 
the drainage intensity or drainage co efficient , it is indicated with mm /day.  
So there are two indicators the first one is drainable  porosity that indicates the pore space that 
is influenced by the drainage water when the water table drops from one portion to another 
portion. And there is dra inage intensity or the drainage coefficient, which  is defined as the 
amount of drainage water or the depth of water which is resulting from a drainage area in a 
day is called drainage coefficient.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:24)  
 
The drainable porosity is influenced by soil texture.  For example, in th e table above , for clay 
 
soils 3 to 11 % is the drainable porosity and  for well-structured  are loams  it is 10 to 15 % and 
sandy soils  are 18 to 35 %. If you have definite pores the drainable porosity will be m ore. The 
drainable water is held by the weakest forces  or the  gravity;  so, because of that the water can 
easily infiltrate down or percolates due to  gravity force  which is the  moisture contents 
between field capacity and complete saturation of the soil . In the case of irrigation , the 
moisture content we are concerned  with is between  field capacity  and wilting point.  Whereas,  
in the case of drainage , we need to remove  soil moisture between the saturation and field 
capacity.  So, this is the basic difference between  irrigat ion and drainage.  
The moisture contents between field capacity and complete saturation of the soil definitely 
include the subsurface drainage . It provides a pathway  for excess or drainable water to leave 
the soil; the response of the water table depends on the  drainable pore space. As the drainable 
pore space increases water table level decreases and vice versa. So, if you have a drainable 
pore space suppose 18  to 35% compare to 3 to 11 % the response of water table, definitely  
increases at the 3 -11% because of the capillary rise  and decreases at the 8 -35%.  
(Refer Slide Time: 6:22) 
 
Example 38.1  
How much water is drained from the root zone when the water table drops from 6 cm to 48 
cm and drainable porosity is 8%?  
Solution  
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑃𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦  (𝜇 )= (𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
𝑊𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑝)×100 
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑒  𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  = 8×48−6
100 = 3.36 𝑐𝑚 
So, for each 100 mm water table fall; 3.36 mm of water is being drained out.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:45)  
 
Exercise 38.2:  
A soil has a saturation moisture content of 37%, field capacity moisture content of 20% (both 
on a dry mass basis) and a dry bulk density of 1.25 g/cm3. Find out the drainable porosity.  
Solution:  
Given, Bulk density (BD)= 1.25 g/cm3 
Saturation moisture content (SMC) = 37%  
Field capacity (FC)= 20%  
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦  =𝑆𝑀𝐶 −𝐹𝐶
100×𝐵𝐷 = (37−20)
100×1.25=0.2125   
=𝟐𝟏.𝟐𝟓% (Ans.)

The water balance equation in both case s of normal and the drainag e situation  is represented 
in the above image . So, the main input is precipitation and  also irrigation if you have. 
Evapotranspiration that is going out along with runoff , soil water storage S and deep 
percolation DP and the water table  and groundwater  is shown above . 
So, in the normal case on the non-drainage case the water balance equation is as follows:  
 P = R + ET + DP + S  
P is precipitation or P+ I  is precipitation and irrigation if you have. R is the runoff ; ET is 
evapotranspiration; DP is deep percolation an d S is the soil water storage .  
Whereas, in drainage case;  
P = R + ET + DP + S + D  
P is only the precipitation  because we are not going  to irrigate  anyway;  so, irrigation  is 0. 
We still have soil water storage, evapotranspiration and runoff and deep percolation and here 
we have the tile drainage so you have drainage flow D.  So, in the drainage the only difference 
between these two is the drainage flow and irrigation  is 0. 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:58)  
 
The infiltration and percolation are important here  because  both these terms are related, but 
there is a difference  in the process described in the movement of moisture through soil. So, 
what exactly is the infiltration and what is percolation. So, infiltration is  the entry of water 
into the soil and then percolation is the process by which water flows within the soil  into the 
groundwater.  
In the image above,  the infiltration  is the  downward entry of water into the soil or rock surfa ce; 
so, that is the infiltration; whereas percolation the flow of water through soil and porous or 
fractured rock, that goes into the soil system . So, the infiltration rate is the rate at which the 
 
soil under specified conditions absorbs rainwater, melte d snow , or surface water which is 
expressed in depth of water per unit time, that is cm/h or mm /h. 
Whereas, percolation rate  is the rate at which soil moisture moves down through the soil or 
permeable rock. So, here we are talking about the flow, soil moist ure moves  down  through 
the soil of permeable rock. So, Darcy’s law applies to the infiltration of the water  into the soil 
so, for infiltration we will be using Darcy’s equation.  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:10)  
 
And then infiltration as I said is the entry of water into the soil under gravitational or pressure 
gradient. So, in the image above  you can see the soil depth and water content on the y-axis;  θ 
is the initial moisture content θS is the saturated moisture content. So, th e saturated moisture 
content is represented with the straight line above , but during the drying phase what happens. 
So, this  saturated moisture content  is going to decline initially as the boundary condition, then 
after that , the wetting front is going to move down  and we get the upper most layer as  the 
saturation zone then after that  is the  transition zone , the transmission zone , wetting zone and 
finally, the wetting front  moves  from depth 0 to Z so this is what is forming t he pressure 
gradient.  
So, the pressure gradient is initially stronger due to the presence of air in the pore space and 
when there is a negative suction definitely th at will help in pulling the moisture front down 
the soil.  So, the wetting front move s slowly downwards, as infiltration continu es the flow p ath 
becomes larger and the pressure gradient becomes smaller; that means the infiltration rate will 
be smaller.  
So, if you see the infiltration time versus infiltration rate  graph , initially the  infiltration rate 
will be high then after that the infilt ration will be less and then it tends to become  constant.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:19)  
 
What is the concept of agricultural drainage? So, agricultural drainage is primarily concerned 
with the free groundwater found in a layer directly below the soil. So, in agricultural drainage , 
we talked about the phreatic layer or water table layer, which will be near the surface or a 
little above the surface called the water table.  So, the main objective of the drainage is to 
lower down this water table below the root zone, f or that we are going to put some tile  
drainage s o, that it can remove the  excess  water from  the root zone . 
So, when the phreatic groundwater occurs deep below the soil surface  at 25 to 50 m  it is of 
little concern  on agricultural drainage , you c an see th is situation mostly in arid and  semiarid 
regions.  
And shallow ground water depth that is less than 5 to 10 m  has much more relevance to 
agricultural drainage  because it is close to the root zone of the plants . So, when the 
groundwater depth is shallow like 5 to 10 m and on top of that there are series of rain fall 
events, definitely the water table  is going to rise and that will influence the crop growth. So, 
the main  objective of the drainage is to remove that excess water from  the field.  
Sometimes, the excess water may not be a problem  if the quantity is very small  and the periods 
of occurrence are short of durations, you do not need to put a lot of money on th e remov al of 
that water . E.g. rain events occurring  at a short durat ion of time; then definitely that will have  
less influence in case of crop growth. And excess water occurring  during non-critical  seasons  
or off-season that is also not worth removing  because you are not going to grow crop during 
that seasons.  The lands only need artificial drainage when a large quantity of water  falls in a 
longer  duration.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:23)  
 
So, the problem of drainage  or excess water may occur on the land surface  in the form of 
surface ponding or water logging and in the root zone , it impeded percolation and cause s 
shallow groundwater.   
And the problems  of excess water  is impaired crop growth; that means, this affects the crop 
respiration , nutrient uptake and increase toxicity. So, what happens , supp ose there is a crop 
that is growing and the water level is on top as stated initially at the beginning of the lecturer, 
the roots required oxygen  to respire. So, during respiration; the oxygen which is in dissolved 
form in the water will be taken by the r oots and definitely there will be an  oxygen deficit  at 
the root zone  because  oxygen  expect ed from the atmosphere will not be able to reach the soil 
pores due to the excess water and  oxygen will not be available to the roots and the plant is 
going to die.  
 And w hatever the nutrients you are putting on top is not going to move down because the 
water is  not going  to move  down  so the plants  cannot  get the nutrients . 
Since respiration is taking place  CO 2 is going to be release d and there is no way to go out so 
this will create a toxic atmosphere for the plant.  
The root zone aeration generally becomes inadequate when the air -filled volume  in the  main 
root zone  falls is 5 to 10 % and the effect is influenced at different stages of crop growth and 
crop health .  
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:52)  
 
Crop s suffer much more from water logging under warm than cold conditions. So , in the warm 
condition , the dissolved oxygen level will be more compared to the cold condition; so, it 
extract s much faster in case of a warm condition that influence s the crop health  and depletes 
the oxygen levels . The i ndirect effect of water logging : soil biota , for example , the microbial 
activity ceased because of nitrogen deficiency ; and soil structure  is disturbed due to  snow 
formation - frost heaving; suppo se you have the water -saturated soil and on top of that frost 
state so because  of frost heaving; the s oil structure is going to  be disturb. The other problem 
of drainage is  impaired f arm operations; so the first thing is a fewer working day s on poor ly 
drained soils and influence workability - till ability  and traffic ability . Till ability  and 
traffic ability  mean  farm operation used for  tilling the soil . Compaction , puddling of soil , once 
the farming operation is taking place that compact s the soil and soil structures is going to  be 
disturb ed. And operation of modern machinery becomes very difficult in waterlogged soil , 
for example, harvesters cannot go into the fields because of heav ier equipment and that is 
going to  be stuck in the field.  
So, other problems of drainage are flooding , erosion by runoff , and soil salinization ; because 
there is no infiltration or infiltration is 0, if any heavy rainfall occurs that leads to flooding and  
lands having slopes greater than 1 to 2 % definitely create  erosion; and soil salinization  occur 
due to irrigation, irrigation water which is having salts cannot pass through the soil and that 
will definitely accumulate on the  surface and that influences the crop  growth.
 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:46)  
 
Sources of excess water are direct rainfall , snow melt, irrigation , seepage  from other lateral 
flow, runoff , and flood water. Drainage load depends on the amount of rainfall and seepage , 
storage capacity of the soil , and rate of evaporation.  If you have heavier rainfall that definitely 
influence s storage capacity and if the capacity of soil to absorb or retain the soil moisture is 
less th at is also another  problem and if the rate of evaporation  is less tha t definitely influence s 
the drainage load. The images above show the pores  in unsaturated, saturated , and flooded 
soil. T he pores are filled with water in flooded soil, since all pores are filled the remaining 
water is going to accumulate on top.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:54) 
 
The components of drainage are shown in the image above. B asically , there are 3  main 
components, the field drainage system  whose  main purpose is to gather excess water from the 
 
land by means of a netwo rk of drains. Whatever water  falling on the surface will be collected 
through the deep ditches  or it could be a drain pipe or ditches. So, the field system collects the 
water from the field.  Two basic principles here are ground wate r drainage system and shallow 
drainage system. So, it should be  a surface drainage system or subsurface drainage system. 
The deep ditch system is opened  to the  atmosphere whereas , in subsurface drainage , you have 
tiles like pipe drains  below the soil surface . There are mole drain s also in case of clay soils , 
since water cannot penetrate down  you can take out whatever water  falling from the mole  
drain. So, then the next is the main system  and an outlet system.  So, in case of the main 
system , it rec eives water from the field system and convey s it to the outlet , it is a kind of 
mediator  that collects the water and throws it to the outlet point.  
It is composed of ditches and canals, once all the field system are connected to  the main ditch. 
The main system is  connect ed to the outlet system; outlets ha ve a terminal point of discharge 
into the open water system , it could be a pump outlet or gravity outlet. The pump outlet  and 
gravity outlet are 2 types; when the drainage base is lower than the low outside drain  base. 
Suppose water which is collected from  the main system  at a particular  water level and your 
drainage base is lower than the water in the main system; then it can go into the  outlet by  
gravity.  In other case suppose your drainage  base higher than  your main  system water level 
then the water needs to be pumped out, so this is called a pump outlet system.  
(Refer Slide Time: 38:14)  
 
Drainage requirement; before going for any drainage system you have to understand whether 
drainage is really required or not. So, first of all , benefits versus cost analysis should be done 
which will give  better yield and low cost; so, whatever the drainage cost  is that should tradeoff 
between the yield and the cost . Improve crop condition and improve the workabili ty, we have 
 
to check all these things to improve the crop condition  and workability with existing or 
proposed drainage . Low-level farms do  not recommend high -cost drainage; that is putting a 
lot of money out  of least gain;  so, that does not work.  Installation  of a pipe drainage  system  
is costly  so, you cannot recommend it for the low level of farming  but you can use open 
ditches for that.  And soil and climatic conditions together with a farm system that determine s 
economic scope for drainage improvement. Crop se lection is based on the soil drain ability  of 
the crop select ed 
Planning of farm calendar to avoid critical farm operations  is necessary ; you have to plan a 
calendar in such a way that critical farm operations  are not affected ; so, if you have calendar 
prepared well and before you can plan for when drainage is required and other things.  
So, this is a little introduction to agricultural drainage, in this we le arn what is the drainable 
porosity and what is drainage coefficient and then  what are the problems with dra inage and 
what  are drainage requirements , and finally, the drainage system components. The drainage 
system contains 3 components one is the field system which collects the water from the fields 
and then the main system, which receives water from the field system and divert s or convey s 
it to the outlet system. Then the outlet system is a third component which could be a gravity 
outlet or pumping outle t. 
Thank you.
