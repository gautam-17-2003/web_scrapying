Lecture - 54 Economics of Drainage Project  
Friends this is lecture number 54 of the Irrigation and Drainage course; in this course , we are 
going to learn the Economics of Drainage Project. So, if you are looking to invest money in a 
drainage project  you would like to know whether it is bene ficial to invest  in a particular  
drainage project or not and what are the benefits after  5, 10, or 30 years down the line. So, this 
is very important because constructing the drainage channels and layi ng out the tiles  involves 
a lot of cost and investment .  
So, here we are going to le arn different terminologies initially then, followed by discounting 
cash flow method and then different financial or economic  indicators to understand whether 
the investment we are keeping in the drainage project is beneficial or not.  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:53)  
 
The objective of land drainage is to bring the land into production so, whatever land is 
inund ated or waterlogged is to be brought  into production . The second is to increase the 
productivity of existing cultivable land.  Productivity means, the yield divided by  the amount 
of water we are giving to the plant, that productivity needs to be increased . The third is to 
evaluate the benefits and cost of any project /scheme or drainage project. These are the  three 
objectives we lo ok at in drainage projects.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:59)  
 
The cost of a drainage project involves initial or capital investments. This involves canals , 
control works, ditches, pipes, pumps , land leveling, land clearing, farm roads, reallocation of 
existing  structures , etc. these things require an initial investment . Then some replacement 
investments  have cost. For example, loss of existing properties, suppose your drainage project 
is going on and all of a sudden natural calamity happened and you lost some o f the properties .  
The other one is the recurring cost of maintenance works  so, every year you have to put some 
cost on maintenance and then the recurring cost of operation and management of the scheme 
and other associated costs such as remolding or other things. The two broad categories of costs 
are an investment or initial cost and the second one is the maintenance cost . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:29)  
 
Then next is what are the benefits  of land drainage ? The benefits here are classifi ed into  
 
tangible benefits  and in tangible benefits . Tangible benefits are benefits you can see directly the 
benefits like enhanced agricultural production increasing the yield , the land is arable before it 
was a not good for agriculture production now because of the drainage you wi ll be able to grow 
the crops.  That is why the agricultural production is going to enhance and water supply for 
domestic and industrial use , etc. so whatever outflow you are getting from the drainage that 
can be treated and used as the water supply for dome stic and also for industries.  
Then another one is intangible benefits or indirect benefits where  you can see the improvement 
in the local environment because the impoun ded water or the excess  water is being taken  out 
the environment will be clean  and impr oved hygiene and better trafficability  since the soil is  
aerated.  
The computation of cost and benefits is very important once the project is done . So, if the cost -
benefit ratio is more than 1 then investment in the particular drainage project will be  
worth while . The c osts and benefits occur at different times during the project period .  
Generally , the cost happened during the initial stages like project construction and benefits  is 
once the project matur e then you get the benefits.  
And then discounting  is a device to bring cost and benefits occurring at different point s of time 
on to a common base  since the cost and benefits are happening in two different periods . To 
understand the investment  in a particular project and w hether we will be able to get th e benefits 
after 20 years  or not . In the cost-benefit analysis , we will bring both the cost and benefits on 
the same base and we will compare whether we get profits or not. So, for that this discounting 
cash flow analysis is very important.  
(Refer Slide T ime: 08:17)  
 
Next is the time period  of the drainage project, if you see the  graph above , the project life is on 
 
the x-axis in years and terminal value on the y-axis. The actual life (AL) is generally 50 to 100 
years for  well-maintained pipe drainage. So, in actual life , you do not get any terminal value  
so the  terminal value will be zero, but the project can continue.  
The next time period  is economic life  (EL) s o, it is corresponding to a notional lifetime at the 
end of which the project will get renewed. So, once you take the end of economic li fe the 
project cost is zero terminal value. So, beyond that the value of the particular project will be 
zero for example, if you buy a car, initially in the first year  the resale value w ill be more , then 
over time or after the usage for 5-10 years , the resale value will be less. But, after 10 -15 years , 
it will be of zero value, but you can still use it  so, that is economic life .  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:11)  
 
Next is financial life, financi al life generally is often imposed by the lending agency. So, if you 
are taking a loan from a financial company, they decide like 10 or 15 years, that is the financial 
life and repayment period of the loan taken from a lending agency. So, this is the repay ment 
period ; 10 years  is very much shorter than EL and AL. So, the project has a terminal value at 
the end of the financial life.   
Farmer expects the benefits equal or preferably exceed the costing arising during the financial 
life. So, these 3 lives  are very important in design or during the economic analysis of a drainage 
project.  
  
(Refer Slide Time:  11:27)  
 
Next is the Discounting Cash flow  Method, this is very useful to understand the investment 
you made today is worth in 10 years or not. So, the benefits will be br ought  back to the present 
value and compare for cost and benefits. The sum of money observed now is worth more than 
the same s um of money in 10 years.  For example,  
Present value: Rs. 100; Interest rate: 10%; Value after 1 yr: Rs. 110;  
Discounting Factor: 100/110= 0.909  
Discounting is the inverse of charging compound interest,  
𝑫𝑭 =∑𝟏
(𝟏+𝑹𝑰)𝒊𝑷𝑳
𝒊=𝟏 
Where, DF = discounting factor, PL = life of the drainage project (years), and RI = rate of 
interest (fraction).   
 (Refer  Slide Time: 14:27)  
 
  
The table  above presents the  discounting factor , the number of years is on the first column and 
the rate of inte rest is row -wise, knowing the number of years and rate of interest  you get the 
particular DF. F or example , what is the present value , if the drainage project expects a benefit 
of 10000 rupees per hectare after 20 years at an interest of 10 %.  
So, f rom the discounting  table , we locate the 10 % interest  and 20  years  
𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟  = 0.14864   
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒  =  10000 ×0.149 =1490  
So, the present value of 10000 rupees /hectare  is 1490 rupees/ hectare. So, if you can invest 1490 
rupees /hectare now at a 10 % interest rate for 20 years you may expect 10000 rupees/ hectare 
from the project.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:53)  
 
And then computation of annual repayment. So, once you decided to invest, then if you do not 
have the money you might take the loan. So, once you are taking a loan how to estimate the 
annual repayment. The annual repayment on  the initial loan at a rate of interest an d over a 
repayment period : 
𝐹=𝐼𝐶
𝑃𝑊𝐹 
Here, PWF (present worth factor) is equal to:    
𝑃𝑊𝐹 = [(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑅𝑃−1]
𝑅𝐼(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑅𝑃 
Where, F = annual repayment (₹); IC = initial investment (₹); RP = repayment period (years)  
RI = rate of interest ( -) Using these two equations you will be able to find out the what is the 
annual repayment amount for a particular loan amount.  
  
(Refer Slide Time: 7:19) 
 
And then third is the inflation factor computation. So, inflation mean s the amount of a particular 
object will increase in future years.  So, the future cost and benefits are increased in value to 
take account of an assumed rate of inflation.  
Yearly inflation factor  (IF):  
𝐼𝐹= (1+𝐼𝑅)𝑃𝐿 
Where, IF = inflation factor; IR = inflation rate (fraction); PL = Drainage project life (Years)  
There is a table available for the inflation factor  
(Refer Slide Time: 7:11) 
 
Then there are financial -economic indicators, through which we can decide whether the 
investment is benefi cial or not. So, one is the Net Present Value (NPV ). NPV is the difference 
between the present value of benefit and cost  and it is also known as net present worth (NPW ). 
  
A positive value of net positive worth or net present worth is desirable  
𝑁𝑃𝑉 =∑(𝐵𝑖−𝐶𝑖)
(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑖𝑃𝐿
𝑖=1  
Where B i = benefits in the i th year; C i = cost in the i th year 
(Refer Slide Time: 19:41)  
 
And then next is the benefit and cost ratio. So, the benefit and cost ratio is the present value of 
benefits divided by the present value of  the cost.  For a project to be economically viable the 
benefit -cost ratio should be more than 1, because the benefit is always more than the cost in 
case of profits . B-C ratio is estimated every year  
𝐵−𝐶 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = ∑ [𝐵𝑖
(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑖]𝑃𝐿
𝑖=1
∑ [𝐶𝑖
(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑖]𝑃𝐿
𝑖=1 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:23)  
 
  
So, now let us see an example  
Example 54.1 (Cost Evaluation of Drainage Project)  
 A farmer in India plans to drain an area of r ough grazing land to enable it to be used as 
arable land  
 Drainage System:  
    Pipe drainage + moling, construction cost  = ₹ 52000/ha  
 Re-moling every seven years  = ₹ 2000/ha  
 Maintenance every 5 years  = ₹ 1500/ha  
 Financing:  
 Bank loan over 10 yrs at 10%  interest rate  
 Inflation: 5% over the life of the drainage project  
 Benefits: Expected additional profit on arable land  = ₹ 9000/ha  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:43)  
 
Calculations (Results are tabulated)  
1. The annual repayment on the initial loan of ₹ 52000/ha at 10% interest rate and over 
ten years  is ₹ 8460/ha (col 1)  
𝐹=𝐼𝐶
𝑃𝑊𝐹 
       Where  
 𝑃𝑊𝐹 = [(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑅𝑃−1]
𝑅𝐼(1+𝑅𝐼)𝑅𝑃 
Where, F = annual repayment (₹); IC = initial investment (₹); RP = repayment period (years)  
RI = rate of interest ( -) 
  
2. The future cost of moling and maintenance (col 3) and benefits (col 4) is increased by a 
standard fa ctor (col 5) to take account of the inflation rate by 5% (col 7 and 8)  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:59)  
 
The results  calculated  are tabulated  in the table above  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:03)  
 
So, from the inflation factor table , you locate  a 5 % inflation rate , it is given up to 50 years we 
will take up to 20 years. So, th e 5%  whole column will and inserted in column number 5  of the 
calculation  table in the previous slide . So, with this inflation rate , you are going to translate all 
these values except the initial loan amount. So column number 7 will be equal to column 
number three multiplied by the inflation factor. So, that is column number 7 and benefits. The 
benefits also need to be inflated  hence c olumn 4 is  multiplied by the inflation factor  we get 
benefits in column number eight. So,  the benefits and cost  are calculated in column number 9 
  
which is the actual future cost . We have to do discounting cash flow analysis  by bring ing these 
future benefi ts into the present value.  
So, discounting factor for a 10% interest rate for 20 years is incorporated in column number 
10. So, with the discounting factor now we can bring back  the present value here benefits minus 
cost; that is column number 11. 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:59)  
 
Now the NPV will be ac cumulate d every year that means, you need to sum up  every year . The 
NPV if you observe is positive that means, it is worth investing . 
(Refer Slide Time: 29:01)  
 
Let us focus on the 6th year and discuss the results .  
The procedure for evaluating costs/benefits in any one year is explained in relation to year 6 .  
The annual repayment is ₹ 8460.  
  
The benefit of ₹ 9000/ha (col4) obtained at the outset has increased in value due to inflation to 
₹ 12060 (col8).  
The excess of benefit over the cost of ₹ 3600 (col9) has a present value of 0.56 x 3600 = ₹2016 
(col 11).  
The terminal value of the project at the end of the 20 year s considered is judged to be 20% of 
its installation cost or 0.2 ×5200= ₹ 10400  
(Refer Slide T ime: 12:55) 
 
The NPV is ₹ 14810/ha at the end of the 10-year financial period and ₹ 56630/ha at the end of 
the considered 20 year s economic life time period (ignoring the terminal value)  
The present value of all costs (PVC) arising over the first 10 y ears  
= (𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠  𝑖𝑛 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑠  6+ 𝑐𝑜𝑙7)× 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟  = ₹ 55526 .55  
The present value of the costs after 20 years (similar calculation)  
= ₹ 57911.6  
The benefit/cost ratio after 10 years= ((Benefits -Costs)  +Costs)/Costs  
    = (cum col 11+cum.PVC)/cum.PVC  
    = (14794.95 +55526.55)/55526.55 =1.27  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:25)  
 
Similarly, for 20 years period  
The benefit/cost ratio after 20 years (including terminal value)   
=  (58209 .4+57911 .6)/57911 .6 =2.0 
From these indicators , it appears that the project is financially viable in the short as well as in 
the long term.  
Because the NPV is positive as well as the benefit -cost ratio, that is why it is worth invest ing 
in this particular project  to achieve the desired benef its. 
There is a thumb rule that if you estimated  even 1 dollar benefit over a period of time definitely 
you need to invest in the particular project.  
So, this is all about the economic ev aluation of a drainage project . Basically , we learn  few 
terminologie s like project period , it has a financial life, economical life and then actual life  and 
then discounting cash flow analysis which is  done to bring the benefits which are in the long 
run into the present value and compare with the cost ; we will be seeing whether there is a 
benefit . In the next class next lecture,  we are going to solve  problems.  
Thank you.
