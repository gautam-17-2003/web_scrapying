Lecture – 20 
Tutorial  
 
This is lecture number 20 of Irrigation and D rainage  lecture series . Since it is the last 
lecture of this week  we focus more on tutorial s 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:34)  
 
So, from the previous  lecture we have seen the procedure to design the basin irrigation .  
Problem W4.1:  
Design a basin irrigation system for the following conditions:  
Field length, L = 150 m,  
Field width, W = 300 m,  
n = 0.04,  
Soil texture = loam,  
Design irrigation requirement = 10 cm,  
Infiltration function p arameters: k = 0.0028, a = 0.545 and f 0 = 0.00012,  
Available supply rate, Q = 10 (m3/min),  
Supply duration = 12 hrs.  
So, let us design a basin irrigation  for this particular problem . The solution here  is to find 
out non -erosive flow rates or  Qmax first. And we are going to find out  the flow rate , which 
is close to  Qmax and with this  Qmax value , we are going to find out how much area , how 
many sets you can irrigate  with the border length how many with a basin length . Then 
once this is done  we are going to find out  the advance coefficient  at tL and tL /2. Once that 
is done  you are going to find out time of cut off and irrigation  efficiency .

Solution:  
1. Determine the maximum allowable non -erosive inflow rate (Q max) as follows:  
𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥= [𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑛2𝐿
7200)0.24
]1.857
= [13(0.042 ×150
7200)0.24
]1.857
=1.184𝑚3/𝑚𝑖𝑛/𝑚 
2. Select a unit flow rate (Q 0) near Q max in such a way that it results in an integer 
number of basins and sets.   
 Since, the available supply rate is fixed, a value of unit flow rate near the maximum 
would resul t in a small basin width with a large number of basins.  
 This would increase the labour and other cost. For example, a unit flow rate of 1 
m3/min/m would result in 30 basins of 150 m x 10 m and would require 30 sets to 
irrigate.  
 It is assumed that the basi ns would have a 150 m length and a minimum width of 
30 m.  
 This results in a unit inflow rate of 0.333 m3/min/m with 10 sets.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:26)  
 
3. Compute the inflow depth (y 0) at the inlet:  
𝑦0=(𝑄02𝑛2𝑥
3600)0.24
=((0.333)2(0.04)2150
7200)0.24
=0.0497  𝑚 
 Compare y 0 with the ridge height and make sure that it is lower than the ridge height.  
 Considering a freeboard of 5 cm, a ridge height of 10 cm would be sufficient.  
4. Compute time of advance to the e nd of the basin, t L as follows:  
 Assume an initial value of advance rate exponent (r) equal to 0.5, rj = 0.5  
 Compute 𝜎𝑧 and 𝜎′𝑧by substituting r = rj ; 𝜎𝑧 = 0.76483, 𝜎′𝑧   = 0.66667  
 Compute the time necessary for flow to advance half the furrow L /2 distance, t L/2: 
𝑦0=(𝑄02𝑛2𝑥
3600)0.24
=((0.333)2(0.04)2150
7200)0.24
=0.0497  𝑚

So, you have to follow this  steps repeatedly  and for a  particular combination you get an 
efficiencies  and you can pick a particular you know  combination  with maximum efficiency  
and that will be the design of basin  ok.

Example W4.2:  
Furrows of 120 m length with 0.5% slope are made at 90 cm spacing. The maximum non-
erosive  stream flow rate is applied in a furrow that takes 1.0 hour to reach the lower end.  
Then this flow rate is reduced to half of its size and, subsequently, continued for another  
1.0 hour. The average depth of applied water is ________ cm.   (GATE 2018)  
Solution: 
Given,  
Furrow length, L = 120 m  
Slope, s = 0.5%  
Furrow Spacing, w = 90 cm = 0.9 m  
Duration of irrigation for maximum non-erosive  stream flow, t 1 = 1 h  
Duration of irrigation when flow rate is reduced to half of its size, t 2= 1 h  
 (Refer Slide Time: 11:42)  
 
 
We know for non -erosive flow the maximum flow rate is given as follows  
𝑞𝑚1=0.60
𝑠=0.6
0.5=1.2 𝑙/𝑠  
When flow rate is reduced to half of maximum flow rate, it is given as follows  
𝑞𝑚2=1
2𝑞𝑚1=1
2×1.2=0.6 𝑙/𝑠  
And the average depth of water applied is given as:  
𝑑1=𝑞×360×𝑡
𝑤×𝐿=1.2×360×1
0.9×120=4 𝑐𝑚 
360 is the unit conversion  
𝑑2=𝑞×360×𝑡
𝑤×𝐿=0.6×360×1
0.9×120=2 𝑐𝑚  
Net average depth of irrigation =4+2=6 𝑐𝑚 (Ans)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:42)  
 
Example W4.3:  
Graded furrows of 80 m long and 0.75 m spacing are used for irrigating a field with an 
initial furrow stream of 100 l/min. The initial furrow stream flow reaches the lower end of 
the field in 40 min. Thereafter, the furrow stream flow is reduced to 30 l/min and the 
cutba ck stream flow is continued for 1 hour. the average depth of irrigation over the field 
in cm will be (Ans. 9.65 -9.75) (GATE 2017)  
Solution:  
Given,  
Furrow length, L = 80 m  
Furrow Spacing, w = 0.75 m  
Initial furrow stream = 100 l/min = 1.667 l/s  
Reduced furr ow stream = 30 l/min = 0.5 l/s  
Duration of irrigation for initial furrow stream, t 1 = 40 min = 0.667 h  
Duration of irrigation for reduced furrow stream, t 2 = 1 h  
 
This problem is almost similar to the previous problem .  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:27)  
 
 The average depth of water applied is given as:  
𝑑1=𝑞×360×𝑡
𝑤×𝐿=1.667×360×0.667
0.75×80=6.67 𝑐𝑚 
𝑑2=𝑞×360×𝑡
𝑤×𝐿=0.5×360×1
0.75×80=3 𝑐𝑚  
Net average depth of irrigation =6.67+3=9.67 𝑐𝑚 (Ans)  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:04)  
 
Example W4.4:  
A field is irrigated by constructing 100 m long furrows spaced at 0.75 m apart. The advance 
time to the end of furrows was 30 min with an inflow rate of 2 L/s. After that the inflow 
rate was cut back to 0.5 L/s and continued for I hour. The average depth o f irrigation is 
(GATE 2007)  
Solution:  
Given,  
Furrow length, L = 100 m  
Furrow Spacing, w = 0.75 m  
Initial furrow stream = 2 l/s  
Reduced furrow stream = 0.5 l/ s 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:40)  
 
 
The average depth of water applied is given as:  
𝑑1=𝑞×360×𝑡
𝑤×𝐿=2×360×0.5
0.75×100=4.8 𝑐𝑚 
𝑑2=𝑞×360×𝑡
𝑤×𝐿=0.5×360×1
0.75×100=2.4 𝑐𝑚 
  
Net average depth of irrigation =4.8+2.4=7.2 𝑐𝑚(Ans.)

Example W4.5  
A border strip of 8 × 250 m is being irrigated by a border stream of 50 lps. The infiltration 
capacity of the soil is 25 mm h-1 (assumed to be constant throughout the period of 
irrigation). The average depth of the advancing sheet of water over the land is 70 mm. The 
time required to ir rigate the border strip, in minutes, will be ____ (GATE 2012)  
Solution:  
Given,  
Border strip dimension = 8 × 250 m; Area, A = 2000 m2 
Flow rate, Q= 50 l/s = 180  𝑚3/ℎ  = 
Infiltration capacity of the soil, i = 25 mm/h = 0.025 m/h  
The average depth of the ad vancing sheet of water over the land d = 70 mm =0.070 m  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:42)  
 
Volume of water at average depth of the advancing sheet,  
𝑉 =8 × 250  ×0.070=140  𝑚3 
The time required to irrigate the border strip is given by:

Example W4.6:  
The following figure shows two advance curve for surface irrigation (GATE 2010)  
 
The advance represented by curve M is slower than N. this could be attributed to_____  
1. The inflow rate to the field is lower  
2. The intake rate of the soil is low er 
3. The field slope is flatter  
4. The hydraulic roughness is greater for curve N than for curve M  
a) 1,2   b) 1,3  
c) 2,4   d) 3,4  
 
Answer b  
That is all in this lecture , so in this lecture we mainly focused on  design problem on  basin 
irrigation . And then we have some examples which are being repeated  in GATE , mostly 
the furrow irrigation case .   
So, with this we finished the surface irrigation  system design . So, we focused mostly in 
the 3 surface irrigation systems furrow , border  and basin irrigation and then the ir design 
problems then  some tutorials.
