Lecture – 10 
Tutorial  
So, we are at lecture number  10 of week 2. So, at the end of every week , there is a tutorial . 
So, this is the second tutorial  for the second week . So, in this tutorial , we are going to solve 
some of the  examples , and some of them have appeared  in the previous  GATE 
examination .

Exercise  W2.1: Water –budget technique of determining when to irrigate  
Date (July)  ET, in  Pe, in

2 0.32 0.05 
3 0.26 0 
4 0.29 0 
5 0.30 0 
6 0.33 0 
7 0.23 0.10 
8 0.30 0 
Given   
Table with d aily ET and P e  
Drz = 24 inches  
Soil water content on the morning of July 1 is 23%  
By volume; θ c = 14%   
Required : Date of the next irrigation   
So, our interest is, when this 23 percent is reducing to 14 percent, so then you give 
irrigation  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:24)  
 
Solution:  
Sample calculation (for day 1)   
𝜃𝑖=𝜃𝑖−1−100 (𝐸𝑇−𝑃𝑒
𝐷𝑟𝑧) 
𝜃𝑖=23−100 (0.33−0
24)=21.63%  
Similarly , we can calculate for all the dates  
Date (July)  ET Pe θa (%) 
1 0.33 0 21.63  
2 0.32 0.05 20.51  
3 0.26 0 19.43  
4 0.29 0 18.22  
5 0.30 0 16.97  
6 0.33 0 15.59  
7 0.23 0.10 15.05  
8 0.30 0 13.80  
 
On the 8th day, the moisture content is 13.8 % which is just below the required threshold 
(14%)  
So, July  8th is the irrigation day.  
And then how much you need to apply on 8th day  
The amount of irrigation applied is  
𝐼=𝐷𝑟𝑧(𝑓𝑐−𝜃)
𝐸𝑖 
Assuming irrigation efficiency  and field capacity of 80%  and 26%, respectively.   
θ is the percentage of the water content of soil before  irrigation.  
Conclusion:  Irrigate on the morning of July 8  
Amount to apply per irrigation  3.29 inches  of water should be applied the morning of July 
8

Exercise W2.2:  A 50 km long canal with an average width of 25 m is used for irrigation. 
Mean daily evaporation as measured from a Class A evaporation pan is 5 mm/d. 
Considering the pan coefficient as 0.80, the mean daily evaporation loss from this canal is 
(GATE 2007)  
Solution:  
Length of canal = 50 km = 50000m, Width = 25 m  
Class A evaporation pan value = 5 mm/d, Pan coefficient = 0.80  
So, here let  us say there is a pan which is install ed nearby that gives  5 mm evaporation 
every day , and considering the pan coefficient 0.8, the mean daily evaporation loss from 
the canal is  multipl ied with the pan coefficient  0.8 to get the evaporation from the canal . 
So, knowing the evaporation from the canal and area , you can find out how much water 
you really need to deliver from the canal; so, that it can meet the irrigation requirement  
Area of canal = 50×1000×25 = 1250000  
Mean daily evaporation loss = 1250000×0.005×0.8 = 6250×0.8 = 5000  
   = 5.00 × 103 m3/d (Ans.)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:34)  
 
Exercise W2.3 : The soil moisture at field capacity (FC) is 25% (w/w) and the moisture 
content at the time of irrigating is 15% (w/w). The apparent sp. gravity is 1.25 , and the 
depth of soil to be wetted is 40 cm. How much water in ha -cm per hectare must be applied?  
Solution:  
𝐹𝐶= 25% ( 𝑏𝑦 𝑤𝑡.) 
𝐴𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑠𝑝. 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 1.25 
Converting weight basis to volume basis  moisture content , you need to multiply the weight 
basis moisture content with the apparent specific gravity of soil  
Moisture at FC by vol. basis =25 ×1.25= 31.25%  
Moisture content at irrigation time, 𝑆𝑀𝑎 = 15%( 𝑤/𝑤)= 15×1.25= 18.75%  by vol.  
Depth of soil to be wetted, 𝑑=40 𝑐𝑚 
Thus; water depth required to fill up to FC  
=(𝐹𝐶−𝑆𝑀𝑎 )×𝑑/100=(31.25−18.75 )×40/100=5 𝑐𝑚  
Water required =1 ha × 5 cm = 5 ha -cm (Ans.)  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:30)  
 
Exercise W2.4 : Potato is irrigated with water having an electrical conductivity of 1.1 dsm-
1. The application efficiency is 70%. The seasonal crop evapotranspiration and seasonal 
rainfall are 350 mm and 125 mm, respectively. The a verage soil salinity tolerated by the 
crop is 1.6 dsm-1. The seasonal irrigation requirement is. (GATE 2006)  
Solution:       
So, here the irrigation is required no t only for crop and al so for the salts to be lea ched 
down . So, that is why the equation here is the seasonal irrigation water requirement   
𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  =(𝐸𝑇 −𝑃𝑐) (1+𝐿𝑅)
𝐸𝑎   
𝐿𝑒𝑎𝑐 ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑒𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  (𝐿𝑅) = 𝐸𝐶𝑤
(5𝐸𝐶𝑡−𝐸𝐶𝑤)= 1.1
(5 ×1.6−1.1)=0.16 
𝑆𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  = (350 −125 ) (1+0.16)
0.70  =372.86 𝑚𝑚 (Ans.)  
 So, the total  amount of irrigation water you need to apply is  372.86  mm. 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:51)  
 
Exercise W2.5 : A check basin of size 15 m × 12 m is to be irrigated using a stream of 26 
litre per second. The depth of the crop root zone is 1.3 m and the apparent specific gravity 
of the root zone soil is 1.6. The water holding capacity of the soil is 16%. Irrigation is to 
be applied when the soil moisture content in the crop root zone attains 12%. Deep 
percolation loss is ne glected. Determine i) the net irrigation requirement in mm and ii) the 
duration of the irrigation in minutes to replenish up to field capacity.  
Solution:  
So, this is the perfect example of an irrigation schedule method   
Discharge = 26 litre per second = 2 6×10 -3 m3/s 
Area of check basin = 15 m × 12 m =180 m2 
Depth of crop root zone = 1.3 m  
The a pparent specific gravity of the root zone soil = 1.6  
Water holding capacity of the soil = 16%  
Soil moisture content in the crop root zone=12%

The duration of the irrigation  = 9.6 𝑚𝑖𝑛

Exercise W2.6:  A bean crop is grown in clay loam soil and is completely developed. The 
groundwater table is more than 10 m below the surface. At the beginning of the mid -season 
stage of the crop, the moisture content is at field capacity. Reference crop 
evapotranspirati on and precipitation values for the 10 day period are given below. Using 
the above information develop an irrigation schedule based on a fixed interval of a week 
and MAD.

P, mm/d  0 0 0 0 5 0 0.2 0 0 0 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:39)  
 
Solution  
So, and the reference crop evapotranspiration and percolation values  10 day period are 
given above . This table will give  the 10 days ETo(reference evapotranspiration ) and then 
the P (precipitation) value . So, using the above information , we are going to develop  an 
irrigation schedule  based on a fixed interval of week and MAD  (Manageable Allowable 
Deficiency) . 
So, first, let us make  a few assumptions  
1. No runoff occurs during the precipitation event that means the intensity of rainfall 
is less than the infiltration rate , so whatever rainfall is falling , that is going to  be 
effective . 
2. The bean crop is fully developed at the beginning of  the midseason  stage and thus, 
the root system is also fully developed . So, we are not going to  include dynamic 
root zone depth here and we are taking the full root zone depth in thi s case . 
3. Bean crop effective  root zone depth is  60 cm and Kc mid  1.05  (recall ed table from  
the previous lectures ).  
4. From  literature data for Clay  loam soil , θfc = 36% and θwp = 18% and MAD = 0.5  
Total  available water , 𝑇𝐴𝑊  = (𝜃𝑓𝑐 − 𝜃𝑤𝑝 )× 𝐷𝑟𝑧  
= (0.36 − 0.18) (60) = 10.80 𝑐𝑚 
 Allowable depletion, AD = MAD x TAW = (0.5)×(10.80) = 5.4 𝑐𝑚 
At beginning soil moisture is at FC and thus SMDi-1 = 0

10 48.9 5.4 1.05 1.0 6.2 0.0 0.0  54.0 
 
For MAD based scheduling, 54.0 mm of irrigation would be required on the morning of 
11th day, whereas irrigation amount would be 36.8 mm after a week  
So, in this  tutorial , we have  seen some problems related to  irrigation scheduling . When to 
give irrigation and how much to give irrigation and , also how to use the pan evaporation 
and water budgeting technique  for irrigation scheduling .
