Measurement of Irrigation Water:  Pipes  
 
Welcome  to lecture number 14 of Irrigation and Drainage  lecture series . So, in this lecture  
we are going to learn  some of the  irrigation water measuring devices  both in open  channels 
as well as in pipes  continuing from the previous lecture (lecture 13 ). 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:44)  
 
Dethridge meter is an open cha nnel water measuring device , it is named after  J S Dethridge 
of Australia . So, basically it consists of  a drum  which is a mounted on an  axle, with eight 
v-shaped vanes ; you can see the v-shaped vanes  in the image above . A drum  is rotated on 
an axle, which  consists of v -shaped vanes fixed outside the  surface of the drum . The main 
principle is the number of rotations  which is a caused by the flow of water is been 
accounted  and that i s being calibrated . So, the number of  rotations will give the  discharge . 
It basically sits laterally  across the channel and is turned by  water flow because , water 
itself causes the rotation of the drum . And a short concrete outlet  formed  is present  to 
provide minimum clearance , you can see the concrete  that create  minimum clearance  in 
the above image . The minimum clearance between the v-shaped vanes  and the concrete  is 
provided s o that there would not be any water loss , since  water loss is not accounted here . 
The meter provides direct discharge measurement  corresponding to the numbe r of 
revolution by the counter . Dethridge  meter  rotate s based on the flow and the number of 
rotations will be  accounted  and correspond to the discharge of the particular open channel 
flow.

Trajectory meter  works on the principa l of trajectory or projectile , for example  let us say  
there is a block and you have thrown an  object , the object will take  a parabolic shape . The 
vertical distance is  estimated by Y and the horizontal distance is estimated by X. For a full 
pipe flow fallin g on a horizontal surface, the distance Y that water falls in time t is 
𝑌=1
2𝑔𝑡2 
The horizontal distance is 
𝑋=𝑉0𝑡 
Combining the equations (substitute for t)   
𝑉0=√1
2𝑔𝑋2
𝑌 
𝑄=𝐶𝐴𝑉0=𝐶{(𝜋
4)𝐷2√1
2𝑔𝑋2
𝑌} 
Where C is the correction factor , D is the diameter and you get the area  of cross section 
and if you have a scale you can find out what is X and wh at is Y, then you can substitute 
X and Y and find out V0.

The other open chan nel flow meter  is orifice meter  this basically works  on the principle of 
orifice . So, for example, if you see  the figure above,  there is a tank  and the  tank has a hole . 
The hole could be a circular or rectangular hole and a  head difference ∆ℎ is forme d. There 
are the two correction factors we  have to find out , one is the discharge  correction factor  
and the other is the velocity correction factor.  
Free flow case: 𝑄 = 𝐶𝑑.𝐶𝑣.𝐴.(2𝑔𝐻)0.5  
Submerged case: 𝑄 = 𝐶𝑑.𝐶𝑣.𝐴.(2𝑔(ℎ1−ℎ2))0.5  
Where, 𝐶𝑑(0.6 to 0.8) is the coefficient of discharge, (𝐶𝑣=1) is the coefficient of velocity  
 (Refer Slide Time: 07:13)  
 
Example 14.1:  Determine the discharge of a 4 -in. diameter end -cap orifice on a 6 -in. 
diameter pipe if C = 0.7 and the hea d on the orifice is 12 in.  
Solution  
Given,  
C = 0.7,  
𝐴 =𝜋 × 𝑟2 = 3.142 × (2×2.54) 2=81.08 cm2 
g = 981 cm/s2 
h = 12 inches = 30.48 cm  
𝑄 = 𝐶𝑑.𝐴.(2𝑔𝐻)0.5  
=0.7×81.08×(2×100 ×30.48)0.5  
                   = 22636 .56 𝑐𝑚3/𝑠 
                   = 0.02  𝑚3/𝑠(Ans.)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 08:30)  
 
Next is the Parshall flume , in the Parshall flume , the whole  water channel is being  
converged then channeled and  then diverged . So, these three actions basically taken place 
in a Parshall flume , it can me asure up to  1500  million  gallons  per day . So, that is around  
5.7 million  m3/day. The flow is taking place from the convergence  section to the diverging 
end. In between the converging section and the diverging section there is a section called  
the throat se ction . So, basically it consists of three parts the converging  section , throat 
section , diverging section . The throat section  has measuring scales  to measure the head. In 
the above images , the dismantle view  can be  seen, it is made  up of metal  and then i ts 
install ed in the field . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:08)  
 
The Parshall flume flow is denoted based on the  throat wi dth. If you have  a Parshall flume 
of 1 inch it means  the throat width  is 1 inch  and it can measure  around 0.28 lps. A 50-foot 
flume  can measure up t o 84950.5  lps. So, the dimensions are standard ized for each flume  
and you can see a table above which  will give the dimensions of different sizes  of flume . 
In the table above W represents the throat width  or flume size, the length s and dimensions 
are decided based on this particular table . Some equations  are available  to relate  the 
discharged and Ha, or there are some charts available to get  the discharges corresponding 
to Ha and Hb, Ha is the head at head end whereas, H b is the head at downstream end. 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:04)  
 
In the Parshall flum e there are tw o kind of flows one is a free f low and submerged flow. 
In the free f low case  it requires only one head Ha. To measure the head, water level 
indicators or stilling well are provided where you can me asure H a, Hb and even Hc also 
which is at the downstream side. The free flow case can be seen  in the first image above  
and the discharge is given as follows  
Q = C H an 
Where H a measured  head, C is the coefficient and n is the exponent , C and n can be 
obtained from standard table.  
In a s ubmerged flow  2 head readings (H b and Ha) are required  and submergence is 
measured using Hb and Ha and submergence is equal to H b/Ha. Basically 1 to 3 inch flumes  
are allow ed 50% submergence . And if it is 6 to 9 inch flumes  we are going to allow 60% 
submergence . Similarly,  for 1 to 8 ft flumes we allow 70% submergence , more than 8 ft 
flumes  80% submergence . And for  90% sub submergence the flume does not  work  
anymore .  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:13)  
 
Now,  we are going to study  the pipe flow measuring devices , previous devices studied are  
flow measurement devices in open channels.  One of the  pipe flow measuring devices  is 
the Venturi  meter  this is also known as  common differential head meter . The image above 
shows the Venturi meter  and the flow which is going in and going out  of the device . So, 
the Venturi meter  is like a Parsh all flume  but without the throat or a cut throat flume there 
is no throat  section . If you see the image above  there is no throat section , but this is almost 
similar to  a flume . An enclosed  view is also shown above in  cross section way of the pipe. 
So, here the diameter D1 this is a converging section and D2 is the throat diameter . A 
manometer is installed to see  that difference in  water levels and give the head  H. The 
following equation will be used for measuring flow in Venturimeters : 
𝑄=𝐶𝑑𝐴1√2𝑔𝐻
(𝐷1
𝐷2)2
−1 
Where,  Cd is the correction factor  A1 is the  cross  sectional area at section 1. H is the  head 
and D 1 is the diameter at the conve rging section and D 2 is the throat diameter. Generally , 
for Venturimeters  Cd is equal to  0.97.  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:04)  
 
The other pipe flow measuring device is nozzle meter.  Nozzle meter  is a simplified form 
of Venturimeters . If you see  so, here the bas ic difference is there is no  converging or 
diverging sections . This is a complete single piece of pipe with diameter D 1 but at the 
center  there is a nozzle  which has a diameter D2 so, the pressure difference  between the 
pipe and the nozzle is measured . The gradua l downstream expansion of Venturi is 
eliminated  so, there is higher head  loss than Venturi meter . It is not used extensively in 
irrigation  water measurement and the discharge equation is same as Venturimeters . 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:23)  
 
Next is  the orifice meter , this is  another differential pressure meter . So, we have  a 
Venturimeter and nozzle meter and orifice  meter . So, these three are differential pressure 
meters  where the difference in pressure will be  plugged into the equati on and then we 
estimate the  flow discharge . Orifice meter is often used to  measure well discharge  and also  
to measure the  chemical injections . They required long straight pipe  lengths  with full pipe 
flow and limited discharge ratio . The di scharge equation is identical to Venturimeter . 
Whereas,  Cd is equal to 0.66, in Venturimeter the Cd is equal to 0.9 so, that i s only 
difference here .  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:45)  
 
And then the next is  the elbow m eter. This is another meter which works on the principle 
that when  liquid travels in circular path  centrifugal force is exerted alon g the  outer edge . 
Suppose , the flow is taking place in a circular path , the centrifugal  force  is going to act on 
the stream  basically throwing the fluid out . The Pout and Pin creates the pressure difference 
between inside outside the elbow . So, knowing the discharge and creating the different 
pressure differences will give the delta P and Q. So, knowing the pressure differen ce you 
get the discharge.   
(Refer Slide Time: 19:45)  
 
And the n ext is the propeller meters  in theses meters we  simply have a propeller inside . 
The meter contains the axle w hich consist of  different blades  (axel blades ). So, the m ultiple 
blades that rotates in  horizontal axis so that means,  the number of rotations  will give the 
velocity and then multipl ying with the area of  cross section will give the  discharge . It 
usually has a totalizer  plus an instantaneous discharge display . The totalizer  will give the  
individual discharges  for particular time  period  of 10 or 15 mins or 1 hour. The accuracy 
can be 2 to 5 percent  of actual flow  and must be installed in manufacture specifications for 
accurate measurement . Manufacturers  are going to provide  the specific  calibration curve  
to ensure  full pipe flow .  
(Refer Slide Time: 21 :21) 
 
Next is the  pitot tube , the pitot tube is nothing , but the  angular or 90-degree  bend tube 
which is installed  perpendicular to th e flow. Whereas, the horizontal leg is parallel to the 
flow. The  angle bend  is installed in a pipe vertically down  and also with horizontal leg  
pointed upstream  and parallel to the flow . It can sense both velocity and pressure head  and 
works based on the differential pressure created by the flow . We use the Bernoulli’s 
equation to obtain the velocity : 𝑉=√2𝑔ℎ and knowin g the  area of cross section A you 
will get discharge . 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:58)  
 
Next is the magnetic flow meters , nowadays these are  really prominent and also expensive . 
It is basic ally works on the principle of Faraday’s law , the Faraday’s right hand r ule where 
the magnetic field i s represented by the point finger and the middle finger  represents 
electromotive force  and the current which is flowing  through the magnetic field can induce 
the voltage . So, the induced voltage here will be  related to the flow velocity . So, the 
magnitude of the induced  voltage  is proportional to the velocity . So, initially  the magnetic 
field is being created and then  the flow induces the  voltage . The induced voltage u is given 
as follows  
𝑢=𝑘×𝐵×𝑣×𝑑  
Where B is a magnetic field strength between the two electrodes ; d is the dis tance between 
the two electrodes and v is the velocity of liquid flowing through the metering p ipe and k 
is the factory set calibrat ion factor . 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:12)  
 
The other flow meter  which  is used to measure the ve locity  in pipes is the deflection  meter . 
Deflection meter  contains  a vane or a plate  at the center  which is installed at 0.7 r below  
the central line of the  pipe. The flow is going t o pressurize the plate or  deflect the plate , 
more flows is going to deflec t more c ompared to less flow , the deflection basically  
captured the voltage . So, then the deflection versus the known Q, is be ing capture d and 
that is been calibrated . And finally, the deflection  meter  works  for a particular flow rate 
using a calibration c urve.  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:57)  
 
Next is a trajectory meter  which is the same as in open channels . The same equation can  
still be use for pipe flow measurement . Knowing the diameter of the pipe  and horizontal 
distance and then the  vertical distance  you can use the equation which is mentioned in the 
beginning of the lecture  to find out the discharge  from the  pipes . From the nomograph you 
can clearly see  that knowing the diameter D, height  H is given on Y axis, for different 
diameter pipes . For example,  for a 10 inches’  height  a 3-inch diameter pipe  can be used 
and correspondingly  I am going to get 150 gallons  per minute discharge . So, this way you 
can estimate the discharge from the vertical pipes . 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:36)  
 
The next is the siphon tubes , this is a very important as far as the irrigation  is concern ed. 
In the siphon tubes or plastic tubes , based on the h ead, diameter and the length of siphon 
tubes the discharge is being  estimated . So, accuracy  could be plus or minu s 10 to 15 % 
and it provides  in field  method estimation of flow . From the image above it can be seen 
that the siphon has been installed  into each furrow , so the water level in furrow  or the 
downstream and the water level in the field channel  will give the head . For example, 10 
inches of head and  for a diameter 1 inch and length 7.5 ft so, I get around 9 - 8 gallon /min. 
The chart  shown above  is very important for measuring flow rate through siphon tubes . 
Otherwise , you can also use  bucket and stopwatc h, in field to calculate  the discharge from 
each siphon.   
In this lecture  and we focused on a measuring  discharges in open channels  and pipes . For 
open channels w e covered in the last lecture  except for a  few measuring devices  such as 
trajectory method , Dethridge  flow meter,  Parshall flume . And then  in pipes  we have like 
a differential pressure meters  like Venturimeter , nozzle meter , orifice meters  and then  and 
again the trajectory  meter  and then  the magnetic  flow meters  and deflection flow mete rs 
and finally, the siphons.  
Thank you .
