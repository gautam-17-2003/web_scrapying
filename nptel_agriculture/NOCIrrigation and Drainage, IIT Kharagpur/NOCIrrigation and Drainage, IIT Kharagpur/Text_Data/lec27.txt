Lecture - 27 
Aquifer Properties  
This is  lecture number 27 and we are going to continue from the previous lecture which is 
on the aquifer properties . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 00:24 ) 
 
So, before going to the lecture  there is an example  
In a soil stratum, the hydraulic conductivity at the surface is 2×10-3 cm/s. it uniformly 
reduced to 4×10-4 cm/s at a depth of 22 m as shown in the figure. If the water table is 3 m 
below the surface, determine the average hydraulic conductivity of the stratum.  
(Refer Slide Time: 02:21 )  
 
Solution:  For linear variation, the hydraulic conductivity at a height ( the bottom as datum) 
can be expressed as  
So, here K is hydraulic conductivity , which is equal to  
𝐾=4×10−4+(2×10−3−4×10−4
22)×𝑥 
𝐾=4×10−4+(2×10−3−4×10−4
22)×𝑥 
𝐾=4×10−4+0.727 ×10−4×𝑥 
Hydraulic conductivity is a continuous function of depth

(Refer Slide Time: 04:02 ) 
 
Now we will understand the  validity of Darcy’s  law. Darcy’s  law is valid when the head 
loss is directly proportional to the  velocity of flow  and Darcy’s  law is valid for laminar 
flows and the Reynolds number  Re should be less than 1, strictly if it is less than one  it is 
a laminar flow and we a lready know how to estimate  Re. The R e is calculated as:    
𝑅𝑒=𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙  𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒
𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑠  𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒= 𝜌𝑉𝐿
𝜇  
Where, 𝜌= density of fluid;  𝑉= flow velocity;  𝐿= length or diameter;  𝜇= viscosity  
Darcy law is strictly valid when 𝑅𝑒<1. but practically, Darcy law may be applied to flow 
condition that exit when 𝑅𝑒<10. 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:33 ) 
 
And, there is the next example here .  
Example 27.2: Check the validity of Darcy law, if the density of water 1000 Kg/m3; 
viscosity 0.004 Kg/sm2; Diameter of pipe = 0.2 mm; Velocity = 0.0025 m/s  
Solution:  
Reynolds number ( 𝑅𝑒) 
𝑅𝑒= 𝜌𝑉𝐿
𝜇= 1000 ×0.0025 ×0.0002
0.004 
=0.125 
Which is less than 1  which  means Darcy’s  law is valid for this . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 05:10 ) 
 
And, next is transmissivity . So, the transmissivity is defined as the rate at which water is 
transmitted throug h its unit width under a unit  hydraulic gradient .  
The transmissibility is 𝑇=𝐾×𝑏 
 Where 𝐾 =hydraulic conductivity  
 𝑏 = thickness  
The coefficient of transmissivity is also called  transmissibility . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:32 ) 
 
Transmissivit y characterizes the ability of the aquifer to transmit the wa ter. Suppose if , 
you have  the water flowing in the x-direction at different layers . So, each layer has 
different K values and the total thickness is b . So, the average Kx can be estimated by  
knowing the individual K value.   
The average K x is 
𝐾𝑥= ∑𝐾𝑚𝑏𝑚
𝑏𝑛
𝑚=1 
And, another average is called the distance average  
𝐾𝑥= ∑𝑏
∑𝑏𝑚
𝐾𝑚𝑛
𝑚=1𝑛
𝑚=1

Specific retention  is another aquifer property. Specific  retention of an aquifer is defined as 
the ratio of the volume of water , after being saturated will retain against the force of gravity  
to its volume . Let us say the volume of  saturated soil  is V, the gravitational water is going 
to escape from the  saturated soil and V r is the volume of water that soil after saturated will 
retain against the gravity.  In that case , the volume of water that is retained inside against  
the ratio of water is retained divided by the total volume that will give the specific retention  
 𝑆𝑟=𝑉𝑟
𝑉 
The specific retention  shows  how effectively a particular aquifer retains water against 
gravity . So, specific ret entio n is similar to the field capacity  Suppose if we have the 
saturated sand grains or sand particle, so due to gravity all the water which is not influenced 
by particles will be flown out.  
Suppose if we have  the sand particles  as shown in the slide above  and this is completely 
saturated , due to gravity  all this water which is  not influenced by particles will be 
influenced by gravity and will be flown out , the rest will be  attached to the soil particles 
and this is called water is retained in soil particles . So, the volume of water that is retained 
divided by the total volume  of water will give the specific retention . Since it is making up 
the pores  so, Sr plus Sg combined  make s up the soil pores , the pores occupied through 
gravity water + field capacity . 
 
 
 
(Refer Sl ide Time: 10:47 ) 
 
Next is a specific yield ; suppose there is a soil specimen  initially saturated , it will drain 
out due to gravity  and the rest will be retained in the soil . So, let us  say that is  Vr is retained 
and Vg came out . Now, Sr = Vr/V whereas,  Sy = Vg/V . So, Sy is called a specific yield . 
Specific yield is the ratio of the volume of water  that will yield by gravity to  it is own 
volum e. Vg is the volume drain ed by gravity and V is the total volume. S pecific yield  is 
also called effective porosity .  
𝑆𝑦=𝜂−𝑆𝑟 
Some portion of  the soil water is difficult to extract , held by adhesive forces  that are 
retained 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:07 ) 
 
Next is the apparent specific yield . All water that is expected to  yield may not yield back  
because it is a trap by air . Due to air entrapment , the water  sometimes finds it difficult to 
pass through gravity , which  means, the gravity water may not be equal to 100%, that is  
why apparent specific yield term come s into the picture . 
Apparent specific yield  is defined as the ratio of the volume of water added or removed  
directly from the saturated aquifer to the resulting change in volume of the aquifer below 
the water table .  
𝑆𝑦𝑎=𝑉𝑔𝑎
𝑉 
Where, 𝑉𝑔𝑎 = volume of water removed directly from the sat urated aquifer  
𝑉 = total volume  
𝑆𝑦<𝑆𝑦𝑎 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:08 ) 
 
Next is specif ic storage  which  is defined as the volume of water that a unit volume of 
aquifer releases from the storage under a unit decline of hyd raulic head , it is estimated  and 
assigned with Ss specific storage is equal to  
𝑆𝑠=𝛾𝜂𝛽 (1+𝛼
𝜂𝛽) 
Where 𝛾= unit weight of water;  𝜂= porosity;  𝛽=compressibility of water= 1
𝐾𝑤; 𝐾𝑤= bulk 
modulus of elasticity of water;  𝛼= vertical compressibility of the solid = 1
𝐸𝑠; 𝐸𝑠= bulk 
modulus of elasticity of aquifer skeleton . 
Ss can also be writ ten as  
𝑆𝑆=𝛾𝜂𝛽 +𝛾𝛼 
Where 𝛾𝜂𝛽= storage drive from the compression of water;  𝛾𝛼= fraction drive from the 
compressibility of the aquifer  
All these terms are coming to the picture because  initially , the soil is completely saturated  
and the moment you remove the water  that is  causing the declin e in the head . For a unit 
decline in the head , it will influence the storage , which is present in the soil specimen . The 
storage is an influenc e because the moment you remove water which is confined  in the 
strata  that will compress  the aquifer  and it will affect the expansion of the fluid . The two 
components  are going on , one is compression is taking place and the other one is the 
expansion of the fluid . In the equation above   the first part indicates the storage from the 
expansion of the water  and the second part is derived from  the compressibility of the 
aquifer  
 (Refer Sl ide Time: 17:35 ) 
 
Next is the  storage coefficient or the S torativity . It is also called the volume of water 
release d from storage per unit surface area of the aquifer per unit decline of the  component 
of hydraulic head  normal to the surface . It is similar to the transmissivity equation if  Ss is 
the K and Sc will be the transmissibility  so, similar to the  transmissivity and K here we 
have these two terms  storage coefficient and specific storage .  
For example, in a vertical soil column, as  shown in the image above and it is an unconfined 
aquifer  where the water table is shown in a dotted line . The amount of water released from 
the system or the storage  per unit decline in the water table or head (as shown in the image 
above)  is called the storage coefficient . Similarly , in a confined aquifer for the unit decline  
of water which is  released from the system is  called the  storage coefficient . In both cases , 
we will estimate the storage coefficient as  
𝑆𝑐= 𝑆𝑠𝑏 
Where, Ss= Specific storage of the aquifer materials ; b is the thickness of aquifer material . 
𝑆s varies from 10-5-10-3  in a confined aquifer  and 0.1 -0.3 in an unconfined aquifer , you 
can see the magnitude of differences . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 20:01 ) 
 
Let us solve  an example  
Example 27.3:  
A confined aquifer of 40 m thickness has a porosity of 0.3. Determine the specific storage 
and storage coefficient. If 𝛼=1.5×10−9 cm2/dyne and 𝛽=5×10−10 cm2/dyne.  
Solution:  
Given, Thickness (b)= 40 m   = 4000 cm;   porosity = 0.3;   𝛼=1.5×10−9 cm2/dyne  
𝛽=5×10−10 cm2/dyne;  𝛾= 1g/cm3 × 980 cm/s2   = 980 dyne/cm3 
As we know that,  
 𝑆𝑆=𝛾𝜂𝛽 +𝛾𝛼;     
𝑆𝑆=980 (𝑑𝑦𝑛𝑒
𝑐𝑚2){1.5×10−9+0.3×5×10−10𝑐𝑚2
𝑑𝑦𝑛𝑒} 
𝑆𝑆=1.62×10−6 per cm (Ans.)  
𝑆𝑐= 𝑆𝑠𝑏 
 𝑆𝑐=1.62×10−6×4000  
𝑆𝑐=6.47×10−3 (Ans.)

Example 27.4:  In an area of 120 ha, the water table dropped by 5 cm. If the porosity is 
28% and specific retention is 9%, determine the specific yield of the aquifer and change 
in groundwater storage.   
Solution:  As we know that, 𝜂=𝑆𝑦+𝑆𝑟 
28=𝑆𝑦+9 
𝑆𝑦=19%

Example 27.5:  
A phreatic aquifer, extending over an area of 220 km2, has a Storativity of 0.15. Estimate 
the amount of wa ter lost from storage if the water level fall s 0.16 m during drought.  
Solution:  
Given,  
Area 220 km2 
Storativity = 0.15  
water level fall = 0.16

 (Refer Slide Time: 23:19 ) 
 
Example 27.6:  
In an area 1 km2 in extent, the initial water table was at a depth of 25 m below the ground 
surface. After applying irrigation, the water rose to a depth of 24 m. letter on, an amount 
of 3×105 m3 groundwater was pumped out resulting in a drop in the water table by 2.2 
m. Find out the specific yield of the aquifer and the volume of recharge during irrigation.

(Refer Slide Time: 25:42 ) 
 
The other aquifer property  is the  hydraulic resistance , here we are looking for two 
properties : hydraulic resistance and  the leakage factor . So, these two properties  belong to 
a semi -confined aquifer .  The hydraulic  resistance is the reciprocal of leakage factor or 
resistance against the vertical flow . Once you have  a permeable surface that means, water 
can pass through  it because it is a semi -pervious  layer but  the water  cannot passes through  
easily that is  why it is called leakage . 
The p roperty of the semi -permeable layer of the semi -confines aquifer  
𝐶=𝐵2
𝐾𝑏 
Where, 𝐶= hydraulic resistance, days  
𝐵= leakage factor, m  
𝐾= hydraulic conductivity, m/d  
𝑏= thickness of the confined aquifer  
The hydraulic resistance is varying from 102-106 min 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:22 ) 
 
The l eakage factor d etermines the distribution of leakage into or from the semi -pervious 
layer  
A high value indicates gr eater resistance of semi pervious strata  
Similarly , in the same  equation  of hydraulic resistance if we solve for B 
𝐵=√𝐾𝑏𝐶  
Where, 𝐾= hydraulic conductivity, m/d  
𝑏= thickness of the confined aquifer  
𝐶= hydraulic resistance  
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:06 ) 
 
Isotropy and  homogeneity  - If aquifer properties or any of the property  are independent of 
the direction that is called isotropic . So, if K is the same in all directions  it is called the  
isotropic . If all properties of an aquifer are constant or independent of the locations,  it is 
called homogeneous . So, the properties are homogeneous when the particular property 
does not  change with the location . So, the location indicates homogeneity  and direction 
indicate isotropy  and anisotropic or heterogeneity is opposite to the previous property . 
If the property  is dependent on the direction  it is anisotropic  and if all properties of the 
aquifer depend on location it is called heterogeneity . Mostly it is for hydraulic conductivity  
because the soil formations vary in the location mostly . Since we are dealing with flow  K 
is the most impressive parameter  in groundwater flow . So, we consider this isotropic , 
homogeneity , anisotropic and non-homogeneity  or heterogeneity  for K hydraulic 
conductivity . 
So with this , the aquifer properties are mostly covered like porosity , the bulk density , 
specific yield , apparent specific yield , specific retention , storage coefficient , specific 
storage , and then the properties of leakage aquifer , properties of semiconfined aquifers like 
leakage factor and hydraulic resistance . And, then the condition of the aquifer and the flow 
system like the properties are the same with the direction  or not changing with the 
direction . We solved some of the examples  and we will be  studying more on well 
hydraulics in the next  few lectures and, then the tutorial for solving a few examples on the 
well hydraulics . 
Thank you .
