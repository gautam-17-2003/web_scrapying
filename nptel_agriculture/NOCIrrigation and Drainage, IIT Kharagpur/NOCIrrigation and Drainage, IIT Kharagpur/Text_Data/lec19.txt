Border Irrigation Design  
 
Friends  welcome to lecture  number 19, which is on Border Irrigation Des ign. In the 
previous lectures we have been talking about  furrow  irrigation  system and design . So, in 
this lecture  we will focus more on border irrigation  and then  its design .  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:47)  
 
So, in furrow irrigation if you remember  depletion p hase and recession phases were  
neglected  but, in border irrigation we are going to  consider those  2 phases  in addition to 
advance  and storage phases . Border irrigation can be a free drained or diked borders , free 
drained is just like in furrows  where  there is  no obst ruction a t the tail end  of the  field. If 
there is an obstruction ; that means  you are diking  the furrows  so that you c an store water 
in the  border or furrow f or a couple of hours . 
Design of free drained  borders is similar to your design of free drained furrows  we have  
designed before , except  in border design  the depletion and recession phases are significant . 
Because  the flow which is  going from head end to tail end  has wider  flow width . So, 
definitely  the depletion and recession  phases will have  a significant role . And the design 
of diked border is similar to design  of basin . If you  remember basin is surrounded by dikes 
and the water which is  coming into the basin  will be  filled  in one basin first and  then when  
it is full, it is releases th rough the head gate present in the basin to the next field . So, diked 
border s design will be similar to the design of basins .  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:00)  
 
If you see the  picture  above  there is a field with slope S o the water surface at the starting 
of the depletion phase will be y o and water is moving from head end to tail end.  When the 
water  is cutoff , the water surface is at yo, when the water level deplet es from  yo to 0, then 
depletion phase ends  and the recession is going to start. So, the line at y0 = 0 indicates the 
water  profile or water surface at the beginning of  recession phase ; so, before recession  so, 
you have yo of water standing on the  surface . 
During  depletion phase , the amount of water  in the triangle bounded by the line - profile 
at the beginning o f recession, profile at the beginning of depletion and y o needs to go as 
run off  as well as infiltration . In the second image of the slide above , the profile of 
recession phase  is shown . In the beginning of recession phase  the water surface l ine has a 
slope Sy. The field of length L is having slope  So, and the water depth at the  field end is y L 
then  𝑦𝐿=𝑆𝑦×𝐿 
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:12)  
 
Let us see some assumptions we need to consider in the design of border irrigation.  The 
first assumption is surface water profile at  time of cutoff  (Tco) as well as time during  
depletion phase  (td) and time at the beginning of  recession phase  (tr) are straight line s. So, 
we have seen that the water  surfaces  in the field  are all straight  lines . And d uring depletion 
phase the depth  yL at the tail e nd and the run off  Qr at the downstream  end remains constant . 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:41)  
 
And third  assumption  is during both the depletion and recession time , sum of infiltration 
and runoff ( Qr) remains equal to precut  off unit inflow rate  Q0.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:35)  
 
And the fourth one is the time required from  Tco to the  end of t d is equal to the time required 
to remove a triangular volume of length  L and Y0 height and constant rate  Q0 through both 
infiltration and run off . 
𝑡𝑑= 𝑇𝑐𝑜+𝑌0𝐿
2𝑄0 
And then finally, at the beginning of t r, it is assumed that the depth changes with  distance 
at uniform rate over entire length of border which is which  can be expressed as: 
𝑆𝑦= 𝑦𝐿(𝑡𝑑)
𝐿 
With these assu mptions , let us see what equations we n eed to consider for design of  border 
irrigation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:37)  
 
𝑦𝐿 is the function of 𝑄𝑟 at time 𝑡𝑑 and can be evaluated as follows  
𝑄𝑟(𝑡𝑑)= 𝑄0−𝐼𝐿=𝐴𝑅2
3𝑆01
2
𝑛 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:36)  
 
For borders  area A is equal  to y because the width is infinitesimally  small , that is why the 
with should be considered as  unit. Then A is equal to y into  the unit 1. For border A = y 
and WP = 1; therefore R = y or 𝑆𝑦L and I is the average infiltration rate (m/sec)  over L. 
Sy becomes  
𝑆𝑦= 1
𝐿[(𝑄0−𝐼𝐿)𝑛
60𝑆012⁄]35⁄
 
So, Q0 - IL = y ×(y(2/3) S0(1/2))/n)  
Then we have y = Sy/L, then subst itute Sy by L for y and you will get th e above equati on.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:41)  
 
And I can be expressed  as mean  infiltration rate , in the upstream end it is I  td and the 
downstream end  it is I (td - tL). At the head end position,  it is cut off time plus the depletion 
time. tL is the advance time , the opp ortunity time is the difference between the t d and tL, 
you can put  in the Kostiakov equation : 
𝑖= 𝑎𝑘
2[𝑡𝑑1−𝑎+(𝑡𝑑−𝑡𝑙)𝑎−1]+𝑓0 
And W alker a nd the S kogerboe  provided an equation for estimating the recession time. 
𝑡𝑟= 𝑡𝑑+ 0.095 𝑛0.47565𝑆𝑦0.20735𝐿0.6829
𝐼0.52435 𝑆00.237825  
This is the equation for  finding out recession time in border irrigation .  
So, based on the little bit information , we learnt  let us see the step by  step procedure for  
design of border irrigation  for free  drained case here . First information just like in case of 
furrow irrigation , we need to collect the field information , then find out the non-erosive  
flow rate . 
So, once you find out the non-erosive  flow rate , you assume a flow rate nearer to that flow 
rate. So, then with that  find out ho w many  furrows  or how many borders are required for 
the field based on the source of water available . Then based on that you will be knowing 
the advance times , the recession times , depletion  times  and storage times  then you will be 
finding out the efficiency .  
Then based on the maximum efficiency , you will be  knowing the particular optimum  set 
of furrows , in case of furrow irrigation and number of borders , in case of border irrigation , 
irrigation efficiency , time of cut off  and then discharge . So, all these things can be designed 
similar to furrow irrig ation . 
So, let us see the first information here is the field information ; field characterist ics, crop 
and water supply . And then second is to determine  the maximum (Qmax) and minimum  
(Qmin) unit inflow rate. T here are  2 equations for finding out  the Qmax and Qmin as follows:   
𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 =0.01059 𝑆0−0.75 
𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 0.000357  𝐿𝑆0.5
𝑛 
And then third step is to select unit flow (Q0) which is a between  Qmax and Qmin. So, once 
you have this Q0 which is selected in between  Qmax and Qmin, we can find out  what is the 
width o f border  and number of borders . 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:15)  
 
You are dividing the water into different parts to irrigate borders. So, how many  parts is 
determined by the width  of border . 
So, width of borders  (W b) is equal to 𝑊𝑏= 𝑄
𝑄0 
Then the numb er of borders will be equal to the total field width divided by the width of 
each border , 𝑁𝑏= 𝑊
𝑊𝑏 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:45)  
 
Once you have  the number of borders you are going to compute the inflow depth  at inlet  
Y0 using Manning’s equation  
𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 = (𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛
60 𝑆00.5)35⁄
 
And then compute 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 which  is the opportunity time just like in case of furrow irrigation . 
So, we are going to use  modified  Kostiakov equation and calculate 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 based on the  𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:28)  
 
Then the sixth step is to compute  the time of advance to end of border  tL using the  same 
procedure as in the furrow irrigation design , you can use Newton R aphson technique  and 
then compute time of recession t r. So, once you know  tL and  𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞.  
𝑡𝑟= 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞+ 𝑡𝐿 
tr is the total recession time and now compute the  depletion time t d using Newton  Raphson 
technique again . So, in this  so, we are going to assume the initial guess  td same as t r  
Assume initi al guess of 𝑡𝑑 as 𝑡𝑑𝑖=𝑡𝑟 
Compute  Infiltration (I) by subsisting 𝑡𝑑=𝑡𝑑𝑖 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:37)  
 
So, once you  have substituted t d which is t r you have calculated the initial guess , then  
𝐼= 𝑎𝑘
2[𝑡𝑑𝑎−1+(𝑡𝑑−𝑡𝐿)𝑎−1]+𝑓0 
This formula is the modified  Kostiakov infiltration  rate equation , and then you are going 
to compute  Sy using th e equation we discussed earlier  
𝑆𝑦= 1
𝐿[(𝑄0−𝐼𝐿)𝑛
60𝑆012⁄]35⁄
 
And compute new value of t d as follows  
𝑡𝑟= 𝑡𝑑+ 0.095  𝑛0.47565𝑆𝑦0.20735𝐿0.6829
𝐼0.52435 𝑆00.237825 
𝑡𝑑𝑖+1= 𝑡𝑟− 0.095  𝑛0.47565𝑆𝑦0.20735𝐿0.6829
𝐼0.52435𝑆00.237825 
After you got the new value of t d then you are going to c ompare with the  initial guess . If 
this t d and the previous  initial guess is closed , then stop  the iteration process  otherwise you 
have to  update the new t d in the new initial guess  and then  repeat the same process.   
Compute the infiltrated depth in  the border inlet  
𝑍0=𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑎+𝑓0𝑡𝑑 
Once you have  td and you can find out  Zreq and what is  total infiltration depth at the head 
end during  td. 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:38)  
 
Next is once you have computed  Z0 at the head end and  Zreq at the field end  you compare 
it if Z0≥Zreq then complete irrigation  and if Z0 <Zreq it is deficit irrigation  and you need to 
increase  the time of cut off  so that there is an opportunity for the  water  go down into the 
soil so that Z0 will be more than  Zreq or equal to  Zreq. 
(Refer S lide Time: 25:36)  
 
Then compute time of cut off and  the application efficiency using th e following formula  
𝑇𝑐𝑜= 𝑡𝑑−𝑌0𝐿
2𝑄0 
𝐸𝑎= 𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞 𝐿
𝑄0 𝑇𝑐𝑜 
In case of deficit irrigation , increase the time of  cutoff  and comp ute the new tr values as 
follows  
Compute new 𝑇𝑐𝑜 by substituting 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 in place of t d in following Eq.  
𝑡𝑑= 𝑇𝑐𝑜+ 𝑌0 𝐿
𝑄0 
Compute the average Infiltration (I) by substituting 𝑡𝑑= 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞.  
And then compute  Sy and tr. So, the same steps you have to repeat . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:58)  
 
Compute Z L 
𝑍𝐿=𝑘 (𝑡𝑟−𝑡𝐿)𝑎+𝑓0 (𝑡𝑟−𝑡𝐿) 
And then compute  Ea  
𝐸𝑎= 𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐿
𝑄0𝑇𝑐𝑜 
Check water availability  constrai nt and  repeat steps four to twelve fo r other unit  inflow 
rates , choose the design which gives the maximum Ea.  
So, for one  Q0 you follow all these steps and find out Ea, and then  for other flow rates also 
you to find out Ea; without  going beyond the  non-erosive flow rate . Finally,  you have to 
pick a particular application efficiency which is maximum , and the corresponding inflow 
rates , time of cut off  and other things . 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:49)  
 
Let us solve a design problem: Design a border irrigation syst em for the following 
conditions:   
Field length, L = 400 m  
Field width, W = 600 m,  
Longitudinal Slope, S 0 = 0.005, n = 0.04,  
Soil texture = silt,  
design irrigation requirement = 5 cm,  
Shape parameters, 𝜌1= 1 and 𝜌2= 3.33,  
Infiltration parameters: k = 0.0028, a = 0.356 and f 0 = 0.00017,  
Available supply rate, Q = 50 (m3/min),  
Supply duration = 12 hrs.  
So, this above informa tion is given  and the solution is pretty quick . 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:47)  
 
Solution:  
1. Determine the maximum ( 𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥) and minimum ( 𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛) limit for unit inflow rate Q 0  
𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 =0.01059 𝑆0−0.75=0.01059 ×0.005−0.75=0.563 
𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 0.000357  𝐿𝑆0.5
𝑛= 0.000357 ×400 ×0.0050.5
0.04=0.252 
2. Select Q 0 within the range of 𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛.  Considering the unit flow rate as 
𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 (0.563 m3/min/m) results in border width (W b) of 88.77 m and 6.75 number 
of borders (N b).   
The flow is adjusted and possible combinations are listed below:  
Number  of borders (N b) Border Width, W b (m) Unit inflow rate, Q 0 (m3/min/m)  
6 100 0.5000  
5 120 0.4167  
4 150 0.3333  
3 200 0.2500  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:45)  
 
So, 6×100 will be 600  which is matching  with the border width of  600 m and then  unit 
flow rate woul d be 0.5 so, this is one combination ; similarly,  other combination s are 
available and we are going to check for all the four combinations  as shown in the table 
above. So, we have selected Q0 = 0.50 m3/min/m .  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:27)  
 
3. So, with 0.5  let us compute  the inflow depth  at inlet y 0 (m) using the Manning 
equation as follows:  
𝑌0= (𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛
60 𝑆00.5)35⁄
= 0.04×0.05
60×0.0050.0=0.04005 𝑚 
and y 0 value should be less than the ridge (dike) height.  
4. Compute  𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 (min) to satisfy the irrigation requirement using the same procedure 
as used in the case of furrow design.  𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞=187 .89 min 
5. Compute the time of advance to the end of border t L (min) using the same 
procedure as used in the case of furrow design.  tL= 34.78 min  
6. Compute the time of recession (tr in minutes since the beginning of irrigation) 
assum ing that the design will meet the irrigation requirement at the end of the 
border:  𝑡𝑟= 𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞+ 𝑡𝐿= 187.89+32.89  = 220.78  min 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:32)  
 
7. Compute the depletion time , td (min) using the Newton -Raphson method as 
follows:  
a) Assume an initial guess of t d as 𝑡𝑑𝑖=𝑡𝑟= 220.78 min  
b) Compute the average Infiltration (I) by substituting 𝑡𝑑=𝑡𝑑𝑖 
𝐼= 𝑎𝑘
2[𝑡𝑑𝑎−1+(𝑡𝑑−𝑡𝐿)𝑎−1]+𝑓0 
𝐼=0.356 ×0.0028
2[220 .780.356 −1+(220 .78−32.89)0.356 −1]+0.00017 =0.000203

c) Compute S y

400[(0.50−(0.000203 ×400 ))×0.04
60×0.00512⁄]35⁄
== 0.00009035  
d) Compute new value of t d as 𝑡𝑑𝑖+1using  below Eq. as follows:  
𝑡𝑑𝑖+1= 𝑡𝑟+ 0.095  𝑛0.47565𝑆𝑦0.20735𝐿0.6829
𝐼0.52435𝑆00.237825 
𝑡𝑑𝑖+1=220 .78−0.095 ×0.040.47565×0.000090350.20735×4000.6829
0.0002 030.52435×0.0050.237825=166 .44 𝑚𝑖𝑛 
So, once you find out t d see whether  it is close to your t r vale or not. S o they are not close 
then y ou have to put this as  initial guess and then repeat the  procedure . 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:47)  
 
 
e) The Initial guess (𝒕𝒅𝒊= 220.78 min) is not close to the new computed value 
(𝒕𝒅𝒊+𝟏= 166.44 min).Therefore, set 𝒕𝒅𝒊= 166.44 min and repeat steps b 
through e.  
8. Correct value of t d = 167. 5 min  
9. Compute the infiltrated depth at border inlet (Z 0) and compare  it with Z req 
𝑍0=𝑘𝑡𝑑𝑎+𝑓0𝑡𝑑=0.0028 ×167 .450.356+0.00017 ×167 .45=0.0456  m 
Since the infiltrated depth at the end (Z 0 = 0.0456 m) is less than Z req (0.05 m), it is a 
case of deficit irrigation and cutoff time must be increased.  
10. In case of deficit irrigation , increase the cutoff time and compute the new 𝑡𝑟value  
as follows:  
a) Compute new 𝑇𝑐𝑜 by substituting  𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞 in place of t d in Eq.  
𝑇𝑐𝑜= 𝑡𝑑−𝑌0𝐿
2𝑄0=187 .89−0.0401 ×400

b) Compu te the average Infiltration (I) by substituting 𝑡𝑑=𝜏𝑟𝑒𝑞

rates. Choose the design which gives  maximum E a value.

* flow results initially deficit irrigation  ** flow less than Q min   
We have five combinations  and for each combination you have to find out  the application 
efficiency  and then  time of cut off and then irrigation  time; So, we are not going to consider 
the star marked combinations because * flow results initially deficit irrigation  and ** flow 
less than Q min. So, only the combination  with number  of borders  is 3; width  - 200; unit 
flow rate - 0.25; Tco 174.10 min and irrigation time 8.71 is considered . So, in this way we 
need to  design a border irrigation .  
(Refer Slide Time: 35:59)  
 
Next is the basin design , in basin design  the tail water is not going  to runoff, water  is allow 
to stagnant for some time  so that i t gets infiltrated down . So, the tail water is prevent ed 
from exiting  the field and the recession  and depletion are accomplished  at the same time  
and nearly uniform over the entire basin . The  driving force on the flow is solely hydraulics 
slope of the  wate r surface   
Assumption 1 is that, during the advance phase  the friction slope  can be approximated by 
the inlet depth  y0 divided by the distance  x, in the direction of  flow this we  are already 
familiar with . So, during the advance phase 𝑆𝑓= 𝑦𝑜 / 𝑥   
When Q0 is known  Y0 can be estimated using M anning ’s equation  
𝑦0=(𝑄02𝑛2𝑥
3600)0.24
 
Assumption  2 is that  immediately upon  cessation of inflow the water surface assumes a 
horizontal orientation and infiltrate vertically  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:40)  
 
Assumption  3 is the irrigation depth to be applied at the downstream  end of the basin which 
is equal to the required depth of water at the root zone  (Zreq). So, this is our criteria , we 
need to wet the whole  field based on the  Z required value .  
Time of cut off  is estimated using th e following  equation  
𝑡𝑐𝑜=𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐿−0.77𝑦0𝐿
𝑄𝑜+𝑡𝐿  
σy= 0.77 also as 0.8 in some cases . Application efficiency should be maximum . So, these 
are the field parameters  we are familiar with you can go through this .  
(Refer Slide Time: 38:42)  
 
Basin irrigation system design  is almost  similar to furrow irrigation  design  again .  
1. Collect  information  on field characteristics and everything just like  border and  furrow  
system   
2. Determine  the maximum availab le non-erosive  flow rate using the following 
equation    
𝑄𝑚𝑎𝑥 = [𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑛2𝐿
7200)0.24
]1.857
 
3. Select unit flow rate (Q 0) near Q max in such a way that it results in integer number of 
basins and sets.  
4. Compute the inflow depth (y 0) at the  inlet using Eq. (19) by substituting x = L/2 as 
follows:  
𝑦0=(𝑄02𝑛2𝑥
3600)0.24
 
Compare y 0 with the ridge height and make sure that it is lower than ridge height.  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 39:16)  
 
5. Compute time of advance to the end of t he basin, t L as follows:  
Assume an initial value of advance rate exponent (r) equal to 0.5, rj = 0.5  
Compute  𝜎𝑧 and 𝜎′𝑧by substituting r = rj 
Compute the time necessary for flow to advance half the basin L/2 distance, t L/2: 
𝑦0=(𝑄02𝑛2𝐿

𝑙𝑛(𝑡𝐿𝑡𝐿2⁄⁄ )  
(Refer Slide Time: 41:05)  
 
Compare the  initial guess value of rj with the computed value rj+1. If both values are equal 
(within the permissible range), continue with step 6, otherwise set rj = rj+1 and repeat step 
(5). 
6. Calculate T co, assuming that the irrigation requirement will be satisfied a t the end 
of the basin, If T co≤ tL, set T co = tL.  
𝑡𝑐𝑜=𝑍𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐿−0.77𝑦0𝐿
𝑄𝑜+𝑡𝐿 
6. Compute application efficiency.  
7. Determine other possible basin configurations and their corresponding unit inflow 
rate Q 0.  
8. Repeat steps 5 through  7 for all configurations and select the design that gives the 
maximum E a 
So, in this lecture basically we focused on  design of border , design of  basin  and design of 
furrow s, if you compare all these  3 designs , in furrow irrigation we negle cted the recession 
and deple tion phase . In basin  irrigation we assume the recession  and depletion  is 
instantaneous  whereas, in border irrigation both depletion and recession phase  are 
significant , we have the equation , we h ave the procedure how to design that . So, with this 
we finish the design of border  furrow and basin irrigation . And the next  lecture  is on 
tutorials , we are going to see an example of  basin irrigation and few  other  exercise . 
Thank you .
