Subsurface Drainage  Design (Contd. ) 
Hi, this is lecture number 47  which we will continue with the subsurface drainage design.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:25)  
 
So, from the previous lecture using the Hooghoudt equation let us solve  an example.  
Exercise 47.1:  
Determine the required drain spacing for the basic design criteria q = 7 mm/d, H= 0.6 m, pipe 
with OD = 0.2 m and u = 0.3 m  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:11)  
 
Trial and Error solution:  
For first trial L = 40 m, with D = 3.0 m and u = 0.3m  
We know  
𝑞=8𝐾2𝑑ℎ
𝐿2+4𝐾1ℎ2
𝐿2 
𝑑=𝐷

𝐿2=4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞+8𝑑𝐾2ℎ
𝑞 
=4×2×0.42
0.007+8×1×2.15×0.4
0.007 
𝐿= 34 𝑚 
So, if you see the initial guess was 40 m and after calculation , you get 34 m. So, this is not the 
same as the initial gu ess.  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:23)  
 
So, we are going to see another trial by changing the value of L  
For the second trial L = 32 m,  
We know  
𝑞=8𝐾2𝑑ℎ
𝐿2+4𝐾1ℎ2
𝐿2 
𝑑=𝐷
8𝐷
𝜋𝐿𝑙𝑛𝐷
𝑢+1   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝐷 > 𝐿/4 
𝑑=𝜋𝐷
8𝑙𝑛𝐿
𝑢  𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝐷 < 𝐿/4 
Since ,𝐿

𝑑=𝜋𝐷
8ln𝐿
𝑢

8ln34
0.3 
= 2 m  
𝐿2=4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞+8𝑑𝐾2ℎ
𝑞 
𝐿2=4×2×0.42
0.007+8×1×2×0.4
0.007 
𝐿=33 𝑚 
So, the final solution is 33 m which is  very close  to the initial guess is 32.  So, the solution for 
drain spacing  is 33 meter s. 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:29)  
 
The same problem can be solved using the graphical solution we can also see the graphical 
solution here and  how this is different from the analytical solution . 
The first  thing here is to f ind,  8𝐾2ℎ
𝑞 𝑎𝑛𝑑  4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞     
8𝐾2ℎ
𝑞=8×1×0.4
0.007 
=457 
4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞=4×2×0.42
0.007 
=183 
Then you use  either of the  graph s shown in the slide above, So, let us consider the graph B 
since we already known from the previous solution that L is 33 m so, in the graph B you locate  
8𝐾2ℎ
𝑞  that is 457.  
And similarly , locate  4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞 that is 183  and D = 3 then you follow the line and you can see that 
it is exactly hitting a point which indicate s that the drain spacing should be between 30 and 35  
m. 
So, if you do the linear interpolation you  will get L = 33 m eter which is the same as the previous 
solution.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:07)  
 
So, there are some notes on the Hooghoudt formula so, if you observe the formula  
𝑞=8𝐾2𝑑ℎ
𝐿2+4𝐾1ℎ2
𝐿2 
The spacing L is the same thing  if you write  
𝐿2=8𝐾2𝑑ℎ
𝑞+4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞 
So, when do you expect L to increased?   
The spacing ‘L’ increases when  
 K increases  
 q decreases  
 D increases (less influence when L is small)  
 h increases (increase of W or decrease of H)  
These are observations from the formula,  so what is the influence of this? For example, if the 
soil is permeable, it has more hydraulic conductivity which  means, you can increase the lateral 
spacing in that case. So, here if you are expecting less q  or drainage discharge is low from the 
area, then  if the recharge which is taking place is also low you can increase the lateral spacing. 
So, h increases in the sense vertical flow are increasing, in that case , also you can increase the 
spacing.  
Simple Hooghoudt formula : When the drainage flow above the d rainage base is neglected  
𝐿2=8𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑞 
(useful when h is smaller or the stratum below the base is more favorable to drain)  
Where a significant vertical flow is to be expected and relevant flow zone has a very low 
hydraulic conductivity (h -hv), instead of h , should be used in the Hooghoudt equation  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:07)  
 
Then the limitations of the Hooghoudt equation  are  
 Hooghoudt’s equation assumes an elliptical water table, which occurs below the soil 
surface.  
 Due to excess precipitation, the water table may rise to the soil surface, and ponded water 
remains on the surface for relatively long periods.  
 For such conditions, the application of Hooghoudt’s equation based on the D –F 
assumptions will not hold.  
 The streamlines will be concentrated ne ar the drains with most of the water entering the 
soil surface in that vicinity.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 12:09)  
 
And the next is an estimation of equivalent depth, this is very important when you consider the 
pipe drainage system to a deep ditch system by in troducing the equivalent depth concept.   
 Hooghoudt’s (1940) equation for equivalent depth (d e)  
𝑑𝑒=𝜋𝐿
8ln𝐿
𝜋𝑟0 
 Van Beers equation for equivalent depth (d e) is (ILRI, 1973):  
𝑑𝑒=𝐷𝑠
1+8𝐷
𝜋𝐿×8𝐷𝑠
𝜋2𝑟0 
 Moody  (1966 ) equation for equivalent depth (d e) is 
𝑑𝑒=𝐷
1+(𝐷
𝐿)[8
𝜋𝑙𝑛𝐷
𝑟0−3.4)],   0<𝐷
𝐿≤0.3 
𝑑𝑒=𝐿
8
𝜋[𝑙𝑛𝐿
𝑟0−1.15],       𝐷
𝐿>0.3 
Where r0 is the radius of drain; D is the drain depth; Ds is the thickness of the aquifer below 
drain level  
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:51)  
 
So, then there is Donnan’s formula proposed for parallel drain spacing.  
𝐿2=4𝑘
𝑞[(𝐷+ℎ)2−𝐷2] 
Solving for algebraic functions, the above equation reduces to  
𝐿2=4𝑘ℎ2
𝑞+8𝑘𝐷ℎ
𝑞 
which is similar to Hooghoudt’s equation.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 14:33)  
 
Let us revisit Ernst equation,  
  It is applicable for two -layered soil profile having different K values  
  The p osition of the  drain level may be above or below the interface of the two layers  
  It considers the radial flow  
  Kt < K b  
Application of Hooghoudt Equation  
 It is applicable for homogeneous soil and for two -layered soil  having different K values  
  Drain level coincides with the interface of the two layers  
  It does not allow radial flow towards the drain  
 Kt > K b,  Kt is hydraulic conductivity for the top layer and Kb is for the layer below  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:29)  
 
So, in the case of the Ernst equation, the total hydraulic head required h is  
h= h v+hh+ h r 
So, that if you combine all these, you know the vertical, horizontal , and radial. So, this equation 
becomes  
ℎ=𝑞(𝐷𝑣
𝐾𝑣+𝐿2
8∑(𝐾𝐷)ℎ+𝐿
𝜋𝐾𝑟ln𝑎𝐷𝑟
𝑢) 
Where D o or (D o+D 2) & D r ≤ L/4  
Dv = thickness of the layer through which vertical flow occurs;  
= y+h for open ditch; = ‘h’ for pipe drain  
Dh= average thickness of the layer through which horizontal flow takes place  
Dr = thickness of the layer through which radial flow takes place  
The image in the slide above shows the drain and water table  and there is a horizontal  K, K1 
for the 1st layer and in the 2nd layer  K 2, the drain is installed at layer 1 . Dv indicates the 
thickness of the layer through which vertical flow occurs.  And horizontal flow Dh is 
concentrating in both layers . 
These depths are very important and y is the water level in the drain.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:49)  
 
Where,  
D1 = avg. the thick ness of the top layer below the water table with permeability K t  
D2= thickness of the bottom layer with permeability K b  
D0 = thickness below drain level up to the interface of both the layers/impermeable layer in 
which the drains are located.  
 a = geome try factor of radial resistance  
u =wetted perimeter of the drain  
About ‘u ’ 
 pipe drains run half full. So,  
𝑢= 2𝜋𝑟0
2=𝜋𝑟0 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:15)  
 
 For open ditch with trapezoidal cross -section, 𝑢=𝑏+2𝑦√𝑍2+1 
 Pipe drains in a trench, 𝑢=𝑏+2𝑟0 
 Pipe drains surrounded by an envelope, 𝑢=𝑏+2(2𝑟0+𝑚) 
Where, b = bottom width; y = depth of water in the drain ; z = side slope of the drain ; m =height 
of envelope over the pipe ; b = width of the trench  
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:42)  
 
And then what about a?  
It is a function of soil profile and position of the drain  
Drain in the bottom layer, a = 1 , since radial flow is restricted to this layer  
If the drain is in the top layer, value of ‘a’ depends on the ratio of K b and K t 
If    𝐾𝑏
𝐾𝑡<0.1; 𝑡ℎ𝑒 Bottom la yer is considered impervious. So, soil profile becomes one layer 
and ‘a’ = 1  
  0.1<𝐾𝑏
𝐾𝑡<50 ‘a’ value is decided based on 𝐾𝑏
𝐾𝑡 and 𝐷𝑏
𝐷𝑡 values by relaxation method and 
Nomographs  
  𝐾𝑏
𝐾𝑡>50 then, a = 4  
So, let us see how we would find out a value.  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:59)  
 
Based on K b/Kt and D b/Dt, there is a table as shown in the image above -called relaxation 
method table. So, Kb/Kt values are in the first column of the table and Db/Dt values are  
presented in the first  row of the  table  and the corresponding a value  is presented for different 
Kb/Kt and D b/Dt.  
For example, Kb/Kt is 10 and  Db/Dt is 4 and the corresponding a value  is 4.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:30)  
 
And then a Nomograph is a lso available. So, here for example, in the image above is the drain 
installation . The drain is at the top layer  and K 1 is the top layer hydraulic conductivity, K 2 is 
the bottom layer hydraulic conductivity , and Do is the depth of water level in the drain to the 
end of layer 1 and D 2 is the d epth of layer 2 as shown in the image. D0 is D t and D2 is D b in our 
case. The Kb/Kt value is presented in the x -axis and the curves  are for particular  Db/Dt values.  
So, just knowing Kb/Kt and Db/Dt you will be finding out the point where it is going to intersect 
and from there just project onto the y -axis, which  will give the corresponding a value. So, this 
way you can estimate a values.  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:21)  
 
The graph  above  is a combination of all  things. L can be determined from the Nomograph 
using the Ernst equation. So, when D 0 or D t is less th an L/4, L can be estimated using the 
following Nomograph.  If you obse rve this Nomograph , on one  y-axis is h /q, and on the other 
is ∑𝐾𝐷 these are known values, so knowing these 2 you  just draw a line combining th em. The 
Wr lines are also shown in the graph above  
𝑊𝑟=𝐿
𝜋𝐾𝑟ln𝑎𝐷𝑟
𝑢 
After finding W r, you just project it on to the line, another sub -axis line  will give the L value. 
So, in using the Ernst equation you can find out the drain spacing by knowing the ∑𝐾𝐷 based 
on the number of layers and h /q value  then W r, these values will be known , and based on that 
you can find out the spacing of the drain . 
This is all about in this lecture , so we sol ved an example on Hooghoudt equation using the trial 
and error method as well as the graphical method to find  out the drain  spacing  by knowing  
certain  soil parameters.  And then after that, we move on to the equivalent depth formulas 
and then the Ernst equa tion. How to find out a and u  and then using the Nomograph we can 
find out these values for 2 layered system. And finally, by knowing the h /q, Wr, and also 
the ∑𝐾𝐷 you can find out the drain spacing.  
Thank you.
