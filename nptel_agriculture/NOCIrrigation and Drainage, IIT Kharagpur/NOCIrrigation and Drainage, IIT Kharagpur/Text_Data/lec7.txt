Evapotranspiration  
Friends  welcome to lecture number 7 of Irrigation and Drainage  lecture series . In this  
lecture we are going to learn about  evapotranspiration , which is one of the components of  
the field water balance ; what is evapotranspiration , how to measure and estimate 
evapotranspiration and  also work out few examples . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:51 ) 
 
What exactly is evapotranspiration ? If you see whe rever there is a water body  there is a 
tendency to evapora te, think about  plant surface or water on soil or lake reservoir , 
definitely water  is going to evaporate . Evapotranspiration has two parts  as the name 
indicates  that is evaporation and transpiration . So if you see in the  field crop evaporation 
will occur from the soil  and transpiration  occur through the plants . If you see th e picture  
above transpiration  is going to takes place through the plant b ody whereas, evaporation  
occur  from  some water  which is lying on top of the  leaf or it evaporate  through the soil 
surface . So, evaporation from soil surface of the crop field and the transpiration through a 
crop plant in a combined manner is called  evapotr anspiration  (ET) . The knowledge of  ET 
is important fr om a practical  point of view as far as irrigation or water requirement is 
concerned . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:37)  
 
Evaporation  is the change of water from the liquid to vapor form . Suppose if there is a  
surface with water molecules  on top such as plant surface , if there is a vapor pressure 
differen ce in the atmosphere that di fference   acts as a driving force to evaporate the water 
molecules . So evaporation occurs from all moist or wet surfaces including s oil, water , plant 
or other surfaces , wherever there is water sitting on any surface ,evaporation  will occur  
when it is in contact  with atmosphere .  Transpirations exclusively is the loss  of water from 
the plant surface or the plant . The plant has stomata  which are small  openings  on the leaves  
through which water is going to  escape . If you see the cross section view of the leaf  as 
shown in picture above , the water which is sitting  inside the stomata  is going to escape 
through  the stomat as to the atmosphere . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:34)  
 
There is another term called consumptive use which is  similar  as evapotranspiration but 
the consumptive use includes w ater used in all of the plant process rather than just 
transpiration  which is the water which escape s from the plant body . The plant also contains 
water  that‘s extracted from the s oil  which is  storing in the plant surface  so generally the 
consumptive use  includes the transpiration  part as well as the water which is   inside the 
plant body  and also the evaporation  which is taking place through the water body or the 
soil surface  . Consumptive use  (CU)  exceeds  ET because CU includes  the other part of 
water which is inside the  plant surface  such as  the amount of water  used for  digestion , 
photosynthesis , transport of minerals , etc.,  inside the plant . The difference between  ET and 
CU is usually 1%, so we are  not accounting the differen ce and we consider  ET is equal to 
CU. 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:28)  
 
The factors  influencing evapo transpiration  are (i ) crop factor  it includes the ground cover , 
root density and the plant  height . If you have lot of crop cover on top of the ground  then 
there will  be a lot of  evapotranspiration because the transpiration will be more . Large root 
density  will extract lot of water and that will increases the  evapotranspiration . Plant height  
also influences the  evapotranspiration positively . The other factor is the  (ii) weather factors 
such as the solar radiation , temperature , humidity , wind speed  and day l ength . The solar 
radiation  causes faster  evaporation rate  and the temperature also increases the evaporation 
whereas,  incase of  humidi ty the evapotranspiration will be less . The wind speed  increases 
the evaporation rate  therefore, more evapotranspiration will occur and the day length   is 
influence by the temperature and solar radiation , so, definitely  it is going to influence 
positively on evapotranspiration . (iii) Soil factors  such as s oil moisture , if you has lot of 
soil moisture  the plant has a tendency to extract more water . Salinity  is another factor,  it 
holds the soil particles so the evapotranspiration will be less , the presence of  impermeable 
layer definitely influenc e the evapo transpiration  which abstracts the water flow to the 
plant surface . 
(iv) Management factors such as mulching , shading , decreases the evapotranspiration 
whereas, weeding   increases the evapotranspiration . If you have  good  amount of irrigation  
and good amount of fertilizer application , that leads to  good crop health  and definit ely you 
have   green can opy and increase  canopy will increase  the evapotranspiration . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:14)  
 
How to determine this evapotranspiration ? There are direct methods and indirect methods , 
the direct method   is measuring evapotranspiration dir ectly in the field, this involve s 
isolating  portion of the  crop from it s surroundings and  determining  ET by measurement . 
Evapotranspiration contains evaporation and transpiration so in this case  so we are 
measuring both components simultaneously and then a dding the m up with the direct 
measurement whereas, indirect measurement  is through  equations  calculated from crop 
and climate data and then theoretical and  empirical equations were  used where measured  
ET data are not available . Indirect methods are mostly  theoretical base d  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:27)  
 
For direct measure ment  of ET let us  recall the field water balance equation.  
 
So, the ET is equal to the soil moisture difference  (SM 1-SM 2) and irrigation  (IR) effective  
precipitation (Re), so these are input s, U is upward  flux which is the contribution from 
groundwater to the root zone  and D is deep percolation and  SR is surface runoff . 
So, if you have these measurements available  you can use this equation to estimate 
evapotranspiration . So how to measur e this  soil moisture if you recall the gravimetric 
method , the soil moisture  at the particular time  T1 is given as follows  
 
Where Vwi  is  the amount of soil water in weight  basis (kg per  kg)  and ρsi is the b ulk 
density  of soil  and zi is a layer depth and then multiplied by 100 which is for unit 
conversion . So, this equation will give the soil moisture  at a particular depth  zi and 
similarly at time T2 you take another sample and measure the  soil moisture ; so if you have 
the soil moisture difference ,irrigation  and effective rainfall  along with other parameters 
you can calculate the ET . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:17)  
 
The effective rainfall Re represents the precipitation which is really used for crop purpose , 
so that is nothing , but the in filtration amou nt which is going inside the  soil. So this is the  
part of precipitation which is effectively used for filling the soil reservoir . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:48)  
 
The other direct method is measurement by lysimeter . So, lysimeter also can be used to 
measure  ev apotranspiration directly in the field  and for th is you need  at least  3  lysimeters . 
Lysimete rs is a circular or rectangular  structure with open or closed bottom . The above 
picture shows 3 lysimeter, the first one is top open and  bottom closed and the next  one is 
top open and bottom open and then  third is top open bottom open , but it has  crops. The 3 
lysimeters were maintain with the same level of  water on top . The difference in  ponding 
water level will give the ev aporation  (Evaporat ion = A) , because there is no lateral flow  
here so the only water losses is through evaporation with closed  bottom . Similarly  for 
bottom open  and top open lysimeters  the difference  in water level  will be  see the sum of  
evaporation ( E) plus deep perc olation ( DP), because  these are the 2 losses  (Evaporation 
+Deep percolation = B)  . And then you can the subtract the ET from the first lysimeter  in 
order to find out  DP (DP = B-A). Similarly  in the  third  lysimeter you have a crop with 
bottom closed lysime ter,  so the loss in ponding water depth  in second day will be 
combination of  evapotranspiration  (ET) and deep percolation  (DP).  For calculating the ET 
we have C and deep percolation (B -A) so  
ET = C -(B-A) 
So in this way you can  estimate or measure evapotr anspiration in the field using  these 
lysimeters . 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:53)  
 
Figure above shows the example  where we used  non weighing lysimeters in the  paddy 
field during kharif season . So here if you see clearly  there are the lysimeters   with crop 
and without crop, we cannot see the bottom , but there is a bottom open lysimeters and 
bottom close lysimeters .  
The data  we got during the  season  was used for estimating evapotranspiration . Lysimeters 
could be  non weighing type and weighing type for example, on the right side of the picture 
above t here is  a line diagram of  non weighing type  (top)  and weighing type lysimeter  
(bottom) . The lysimeter has the load cells and it is sitting on the load cells  and directly you 
can get the weight of the lysimeter daily or wh enever  you required . The loss in water 
definitely causes the  the loss in weight so that weight will directly give how much amount 
of moisture is loss and this weight loss will give the evapotranspiration . 
(Refer Slide Time: 19:45)  
 
Next  are some terminol ogies the first one is potential  evapotranspiration (PET),  this is the 
maximum rate  at which water if available , can be  removed from the soil and plant surfaces , 
so that means  this is under no stress condition . So that means,  the maximum   that the plant 
can extract from  the soil surface that that will be the maximum evapotranspiration .  
Actual  evapotranspiration  (AET), some time the  plant  might be under  stress because of 
deficit irrigation or insufficient fertilizers  application;  under the water  stress or fertilizer 
stress conditions  the plant is n ot ideal (or it has some diseases ). So the amount of 
evapotranspiration you are  observing  is actual evapotranspiration .  
Reference crop evapotranspiration  (ET 0) this is similar to the potential e vapotranspiration , 
but we are referring to a particular  crop or grass  like alfalfa  that is reference grass or 
reference cover  also called reference  ET. ET0 is the rate of  evapotranspiration  from an 
extensive surface of  8 to 10 cm tall green grass covered u niform height  actively growing 
and completely shading the ground and  not s hort of water  (not under water stress 
condition ). 
So, assume that you are maintaining a g rass crop under 8 to 15 cm tall and it is actively 
growing you are not making any  water stres s or fertilizer  stress, it is well grown and the 
grass completely  covered the ground , that means  there is no patches  and it has uniform 
heights  so under t hat condition if you are me asuring evapotranspiration that i s called 
reference evapotranspiration . 
(Refer Slid e Time: 22:39)  
 
And then the indirect methods  of measurement  are mostly  equations  for example, 
following is the  equation  of evapotranspiration  ETc,  
 
It is the basic  form of equation we are considering , it has t wo parts or two terms  that is  Kc 
which is the crop c oeffic ient and  ET0 which  is the reference evapotranspiration  
So, once you have reference evapotranspiration and the crop c oefficient multiplying them 
will give the crop evapotranspiration  and then  if you have some adjustment or if you are 
considering the water s tress Ks then:  
 
Ks is the moisture stress coefficient that depends  upon available soil moisture .  
The picture  above is given by  FAO , and it  shows  ET0 of a grass  crop, that mostly depends 
on the  climatic parameters like radiation , temperature , wind speed a nd humidity . The grass 
is well watered that means, there is no water stress and the gro und is completely covered 
and the grass  is of uniform  heigh t. Whereas,  ETc or crop evapotranspiration  is obtained 
from  ET0 by multiply ing it  with crop coefficient Kc. And then there is  ETcadj its the same 
thing s you have  ET0, but you have  Kc and Ks, Ks is a adjusting for moisture stress and  K 
c is the crop coefficient  . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:58)  
 
The table above shows the crop coefficient  for different crops , so generally the crop 
coeffi cient Kc will also vary with  different crop growth stages . For example, during the 
complete growth  period  as shown in image above there is  Kc for the initial period  then 
after that  Kc is going to increase  and the n remains constant  during mid season and then is  
going to decline at the  end . So there are three  Kc values for any crop , that is Kc initial 
value and  Kc mid value  and Kc end value . For example, the wheat crop  as shown in table 
above , Kc initial is 0.3 and then  Kc mid  is 1.15 and Kc end could be 0.25 to 0.40. So, Kc 
varie s and depends on  the how well the crop is growing or different varieties for different 
growth stages  so from the table you can get the values and multiplied with  ET0 and you 
get the ETc for different growth stages . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:47)  
 
The above table presents the methods available for  ET measurement  or estimation, some 
are temperature based , some are  radiation based , evaporation based  and some  are 
combination of both  temperature radiation . These are  well available in the  literature and 
you can go through it . 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:09)  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:19)  
 
FAO 56 Penman -Monteith method  is mostly used by researchers for estimating  ET0.

Where, ETo = Reference evapotranspiration [mm day -1]; Rn = Ne t radiation at the crop 
surface [MJ m -2 day -1]; G  = Soil heat flux density [MJ m -2 day -1]; T = Mean daily air 
temperature at 2 m height [°C]; u2 = Wind speed at 2 m height [m s -1]; es = Saturation 
vapour pressure [kPa]; ea = Actual vapour pressure [kPa]; es - ea = Saturation vapour 
pressure deficit [kPa]; D = Slope vapour pressure curve [kPa °C -1]; g = Psychometric 
constant [kPa °C -1]. 
And so basically  in this equation  ET0 is a function of radiation , temperature , wind speed  
and saturation vapor  pressure  and once you estimate this  ET0  you can  get ETc by 
multiplying it with Kc.  
Similarly Hargreaves and  Samani methods  required radiation and temperature  for ET 
estimation  
 
Where R a is extra -terrestrial radiation in equivalent mm of water evaporation for the 
period, T mean is the mean temperature in 0C, and TD is the difference between maximum 
and minimum temperatures.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:52)  
 
Blaney Criddle method  is also  a famous method , it mostly  depends on t emperature and 
this will directly give the potential ev apotranspiration .  
PET = 𝑝 (0.46 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  + 8.188) 
Where PET is the potential evapotranspiration [mm day−1] (monthly); T mean is the mean 
daily temperature [°C] 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛=𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥  + 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛  
2; p is the mean daily percentage of annual 
daytime hours .  
Fourth method  is the pan-evaporation method , generally this method  is a field based 
method . The class A pan has a  120.7  cm diameter  and 25 cm  depth and it will be installed 
at a height of 15 cm above the ground  over a wooden box . The water level initially is filled 
up to a mark , there is stilling  well inside the pan  where we get the  water level readings . 
Since the stilling well has  hole at the bottom  so the level outside the stilling  well is equal 
to level inside the stilling well .  
For example at  9 AM you fill the w ater and the next day 9 AM, you check the  water level 
in th e stilling well so that will give the pan evaporation Epan during the whole day  and 
inorder  to convert  to ET0 there is a c oefficient  Kp or the pan c oefficient . You have to  
multiply Epan with the pan coefficient (generally it is 0.7) and then you get  ET0. 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:18)  
 
Let us solve an examples  
A class A Pan was setup adjacent to a lake. The depth of water in the Pan at beginning was 
195 mm. In that week, a rainfall of 45 mm was observed and  15 mm of water was removed 
from the Pan to keep the water level in the specified depth. If the depth of water at the end 
of the week was 190 mm, calculate the Pan evaporation using a suitable Pan coefficient 
and estimate lake evaporation of the week.  
Solution: 
The total water present in the beginning is  195 mm, then the rainfall contributed 45 mm, 
then evaporation  the loss is 15 mm.  
Total water present in the Pan = 195 + 45 – 15 = 225 mm  
Evaporation from the Pan = 225 – 190 = 35 mm  
Assume a Pan coefficien t of 0.7  
Evaporation from Lake= 0.7 x 35 = 24.5 mm  
We are we are  multiplying with the pan c oefficient  because the pan is a small er in size  and  
the water is  evaporating from the small area  so definitely the evaporation will be larger 
compared to the  respect ive lake. So there is a correction factor that ’s 0.7 which is the pan 
coefficient to multiply  with th E pan so that it will be equal to  the reservoir or lake . 
(Refer Slide Time: 34:02)  
 
Crop coefficient could be a single crop coefficient or dual crop coeff icient . In single crop 
coefficient  you are combining both transpiration and evaporation so this will give the 
combined  crop c oefficient .  
 
ETcrop is equal to  Kc into  ET0, So here the  Kc is called  a single crop coefficient and this 
includes effect of  evapo ration from the both  plant and soil surfaces  combined . 
There is a dual crop coefficient where Kc is splitted into  two coefficients  
 
Where one is from crop  transpiration  (Kcb) that is termed as basal  crop coefficient  and 
other is from the soil eva poration  (Ke). So one is from the soil  and one is from  plant, so 
you have t wo coefficients that i s why this is dual crop coefficient . 
(Refer Slide Time: 35:29)  
 
And here is another  example. Compute the ET value in the month of July at a place 28oN 
latitude if t he long term data of temperature for the month of July is 30.5oC. The value of 
consumptive use coefficent for the month may be taken as 0.6. compute the value 
separately, using Blaney -Criddle method.  
Solution:  
PET = 𝑝 (0.46 𝑇𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  + 8.188) 
Where,  
PET is the potential evapotranspiration [mm day−1] (monthly)  
Tmean is the mean daily temperature [°C] given as Tmean = (𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥  + 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛  )/ 2 
p is the mean daily percentage of annual daytime hours  
 PET = 9.58(0.46×30.5+8.188) 
= 9.58×22.218 
=212.71 𝑚𝑚  𝑑𝑎𝑦−1 
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒  𝑢𝑠𝑒 = 0.6×212.71= 127.62 
So with this  the lecture ends , so we focused on  what is evapotran spiration  and what is 
evaporation , what is a transpiration and there are some different terminologies , potential 
evapotranspiration , actual evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration . How to 
measure the evapotranspiration , how to estimate evapotranspiration using a  different 
equat ions and the measurement of evapotranspiration mostly done  by using  pan either pan  
evaporative pan or  lysimeters or you can also use water balance  equations knowing the 
other inputs . 
Thank you .
