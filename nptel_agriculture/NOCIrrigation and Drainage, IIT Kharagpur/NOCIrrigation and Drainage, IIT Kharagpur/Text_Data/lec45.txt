Lecture - 45 Tutorial  
This lecture number 45  is on Tutorial, of whatever we will learn  in this week  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:26)  
 
Example W9.1:  Mole drain is the most suitable drainage system for heavy clay soil        
Example W9.2:  During land leveling of  agricultural land for irrigation and drainage purposes, 
the acceptable deviation in the elevation from the design value in the meter is 0.015         
Example W9.3:  The gridiron pipe drainage system is more economical than the herringbone 
pipe drainage system because the number of junctions and the double -drained area is reduced   
(Refer Slide Time: 02:28)  
 
Example W9.4:  
In a subsurface drainage system, the peak discharge t hrough tile drain under full flow condition 
is given by  
𝑄 = 6.715 ×10−4×𝑆0.5×𝑛−1  
Where, Q = discharge, m3/s, S = drain bed slope , and n = Manning’s roughness coefficient.  
The s ize of the drain in mm is       
Solution:  
Given,  
𝑄 = 6.715 ×10−4×𝑆0.5×𝑛−1                                     (1) 
As we know that,  
𝑄=𝐴×𝑉 
Where, 𝐴= area  
𝑉= velocity  
(Refer Slide Ti me: 04:05)

𝑑=0.10 m 
𝑑=10 cm (Ans.)  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:27)  
 
Example W9.5:  In a sub -surface drainage system, the tile drains are laid with a slope of 0.28 % 
to carry a peak discharge of 3 L/s per drain. If the Manning’s n is 0.011, the practical diameter 
of tile required is   
Solution:  
Given,  
slope = 0.28%  
Discharge = 3 L/s  
n = 0.011

𝑑=0.097𝑚=97.46 𝑚𝑚  (Ans.)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 07:48)  
 
Example W9.6:  The depths from the soil surface to subsurface tile drains, impermeable soil 
layer , and the highest water table are measured as 2.8 m, 5.0 m , and 0.8 m, respectively. The 
effective hydraul ic head for drainage in the meter is  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:05)  
 
Given,  
  Depth from soil surface  to drain = 2.8 m  
  Water table depth =  0.8 m  
From the figure,  
  Effective hydraulic head of drainage = 2.8 -0.8 
          =2 m (Ans.)  
So, these are some of the examples related to  this week’s lectures, mostly covered some of the 
problems given in the GATE examination  you can also go through some other problems in the 
referred textbooks . 
Thank you so much.
