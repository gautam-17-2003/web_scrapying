Lecture - 46 Subsurface Drainage Design  
Hi, welcome to lecture number 46, on Subsurface Drainage Design. In this lecture , we are 
going to estimate the steady -state flow of drainage water to the drains and , we are going to 
derive  Hooghoudt ’s Equation  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:49).  
 
Before going into the details of drainage design principles  it require s developing so me criteria. 
So, the drainage design should specify the operation of the system and the physical 
configurations that fulfi ll the drainage objectives, you have to see what is our drainage 
objective whether to dispose of the excess water on the surface or to  remove excess water from 
the root zone as well as the soils.  
Then consider the irrigation and drainage systems as  integrated water management systems  and 
minimized deep percolation loss es through improving the water management system.   
And then character ized by establishing the water table depth at the midpoint between laterals 
and drainage coefficient; that means, in a day the amount of water which is resulting from the 
drains  or drainage coefficient should equate the depth to the water table at the midway.  
And specify option regarding reuse of drainage water  for irrigation or stimulation of in -situ use 
by crop through control of water table .  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:09).  
 
The above flowchart indicate s the steps we need to follow  to design the draina ge system. The 
first one is the investigation, we need to investigate the things like soil profile, geohydrologic , 
and groundwater quality. These things need to be understood before installing or planning a 
drainage system. E.g., soil profile, whether it i s a layered soil or clay soil or sandy soils , and 
geohydrologic in the sense  is the hydraulic conductivity at different places and different depths 
and quality of groundwater . Next is  measuring  which involves the quality of propose d irrigation  
water, you n eed to check whether the quality is  ok to artificially irrigate the plant or not.  
And then estimating the sources of drainage water other than irrigation as are there other 
sources of drainage water other than irrigation. And reviewing and analyzing  the cl imate data 
of the area is very much required to understand the pe ak discharges from the particular area. 
And then selecting appropriate crops or cropping pattern  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:53).  
 
Then the next step after selecting appropriate crop and cropping patterns  is measur ing the 
hydraulic conductivity and root zone of the soil . Then estimating the  drainage coefficient which 
is the amount of water being drained from the area in 24 hours.  Once all these things are done  
one need s to optimize  the drain depth that is how deep you are going to install the drain and 
also the spacing between the drains.  
Two ways drain depth is specified :  
Drain depth is specified and the spacing is calculated based on the recharge schedule and the 
mid-point water -table depth criteria. H ere the drain depth is first fixed and then you have to 
iterate  the length.  
Drain depth is varied to calculate a range of depths and spacing, and economic analysis is 
performed for each case.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:35)  
 
Next is once the drain depth and drain spacing are decided then the lateral pipes size and main 
pipe size are decided , we’ve discussed this in the previous lectures . And then after  that is 
designing the drain envelope material, we need to find out the drain env elope material which 
is generally greater than 10 times the hydraulic conductivity of the soil material . 
Then  you have to design the drainage disposal system or reuse the drainage system, whether 
you have to design the drainage disposal system or whether y ou need to dispose  of the drain 
water . If you are going to reuse that water back to the irrigation system irrigating the crop, then 
you have to design the drainage system for reuse  purpose s. And then finally, design the pump 
size and pump maximum drainage discharge from the field.  Once the drainage water is coming 
to the main ditch then the outlet is coming to the picture, whether you need to pump out or it is 
a gravity outlet.  
The United States Bureau of reclamation recommends the installation of drains a t a depth of 
2.4 m if possible to provide a balance between the system cost and spacing.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:19).  
 
Then after that, how to calculate the drainage coefficient using the water balance equation . The 
drainage requirement is also called  drainage intensity or drainage coefficient different  and for 
estimating the drainage requirement th ese steps may be followed  
 Collect long -term rainfall and other weather data for the project area  
 Calculate daily average rainfall, evaporation, and evapotranspi ration rate for the target 
crop season  
 Perform water -balance  
 Under natural rainfall condition, water balance can be expressed as  
𝑃 = 𝐸𝑇 + 𝑅 + 𝐷              
  𝑜𝑟     
     𝐷 = 𝑃 − 𝐸𝑇 − 𝑅  
Where, P = rainfall rate (mm/d);  
ET = evapotranspiration  rate (mm/d);  
R = surface runoff amount, mm/d;  
D = deep percolation or subsurface drainage amount (mm/d) and it  indicate the drainag e 
coefficient or drainage requirement.  
  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:04)  
 
And then the next is drain spacing the drain depth and spacing should be such that the water 
table midway between the drains remains below the root zone, which is th e basic criteria in 
selecting the depth and spacing  
Deeper the drains wider spacing and le ss is the number of drains  and you can save some money. 
Because earth  working will be minimized  and also the number of pipes , the number of laterals 
will also be reduced, but the depth and spacing of subsurface drain depend on the hydraulic 
conductivity of  soil, the crop to be grown , outlet condition , and agronomic  practices. So, all 
these things need  to be considered before deciding a drain depth and spacing.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:19).  
 
So, the drain spacing formula  depends on steady -state and unsteady -state conditions. In the 
previous lecture, we were discussing the steady -state condition. So, the  main assumption in 
steady -state is that the rate of recharge to the groundwater will be equal to the rate of discharge 
through the drain pipe. The hydraulic head  or height of the water table between drains remain s 
constants.  So, th ese are the  assumption s, and the other assumptions are like soil is homogenous 
and isotropic .  
Then in the case of the unsteady case the terms are vary ing like the rate of recharge v aries with 
time, the flow of groundwater towards the drain is not steady . 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:57).  
 
And then for the steady -state formula, steady constant flow occurs through the soil to the  drain . 
The discharge equals to recharge and h is constant right. In the image above let us assume the 
recharge is q and the discharge is also q So, q = q and h = constant . 
In case of unsteady , all are going to change like q is going to change. And the drain discharge 
is going to change and h is goin g to change under unsteady state condition.  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:29)  
 
The procedure  depicted above is for calculating drain spacing L  which  was also explained  in 
the last class ; like knowing the q that is the drain discharge and H is the root zone depth, W is 
the drain depth you can estimate h which is  
𝑊−𝐻=ℎ 
And then knowing the soil parameters like hydraulic conductivity and drain type s such as  tile 
drain or ditch , drain space formula will be used, and finally, L will be calculated.  
In the image above water flow is schemati ze for finding out drain spacing, it clearly shows the 
assumption taken from  the real field to schematized field for mo deling purpose. So, if you see 
there is a vertical flo w taking place initially and then towards the drain , there is a  radial flow 
whereas, for making the modeling simple  after the vertical flow  there is a horizontal flow and 
then radial flow. The horizontal flow is influence d at L/4 distance and radial flow is influence 
0.7d from the drainage  base. 
(Refer Slide Time: 16:20)  
 
Hooghoudt’s formula is based on Dupuit -Forcheimer assumptions. The assumptions of 
Hooghoudt’s formula can be summarized as follows:  
 The soil is homogeneous and isotropic  
 Darcy’s law is valid for the flow of water through the soil into the drain  
 An impermeable layer underlies the drain  
 The hydraulic gradient at any point in the flow regime is equal to the slope of the water  
table above the point  
 The diameter of the drain is small compared  to the saturated thickness below the drain  
 The drains have no entrance resistance  
 The flow -through drain is half -full  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:14)  
 
So, based on the assumptions, only head loss due to h orizontal and radial flow to pipes is 
considered. So, since it is mentioned that this is steady -state  
So, h = hv + hh + hr + he.  
So, h v and h e are neglect ed here, based on the Hooghoudt  assumptions h = h h + h r, that is h ead 
due to horizontal flow and radial flow, we have derived this equation in the previous lecture 
and, h r is from Ernst equation,  we have also discussed in the previous lecture . 
So, combining these two  will give the head at any point from the drain spac ing  
h = hh + hr 
ℎ =𝑞𝐿ℎ2
8𝐾𝐷ℎ+𝑞𝐿

𝑢  
Hooghoudt conceived that a parallel open ditch system with the ditches reaching to the 
impermeable substratum could generate the same q for the same water table head h as an 
identically spaced pipe drain system by reducing depth D to the impermeable stratum. So, here 
to make the open ditch system to a pipe drain system or the pipe drain system to open drain 
system  he assumed that for the same hydraulic head and  same discharge  it can be possible when  
the pipe drain is installed at the impervious layer.  
So, the pipe drainage system can be converted  into a n open ditch system by assuming that this 
pipe is exactly sitting at the impervious surface  and h and q will not change. The depth D here 
is no t considered any more then an equivalent depth de will be calculated ; that means, for 
making th is, you can  eliminate the radial flow, it is now completely the horizontal flow.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:06)  
 
And the equivalent flow  or the horizontal flow.  
ℎ = ℎℎ∗(𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡 ) = 𝑞𝐿ℎ2
8𝐾𝐷ℎ∗ 
Since d < D, h h* > hh, Dh* ≈ d + h/2  
ℎ=𝑞𝐿2
8𝐾(d + h/2) 
q=8Kdh
L2+4Kh2
L2 
So, here if you observe , the horizontal flow takes place partly below the drainage base (average 
thickness = d) and partly above the drainage base (thickness of this zone = h/2)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 24:51).  
 
If both zones have different K,  
𝑞=8𝐾2𝑑ℎ
𝐿2+4𝐾1ℎ2
𝐿2 
Where, K 1 = upper zone hydraulic conductivity; K 2 = lower zone hydraulic conductivity  
‘d’ is determined as,  
            𝑑=𝐷
8𝐷
𝜋𝐿ln𝐷
𝑢+1   for D > L/4  
             𝑑=𝜋𝐷
8ln𝐿
𝑢    for D < L/4  
Where u is the wet  entry perimeter of the drain  
We are going to see how to calculate wet entry perimeter, so with these condition s, you can 
estimate the one value, but if you see here the same  equation can be written  as 
𝐿2=8𝐾2𝑑ℎ
𝑞+4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞 
So, here L is a function of d but if you see in this equation of d  it is a function of L. So, that is 
why this is an implicit equation  and to  calculate  this implicit equation, we have to use the trial 
and error method for calculating the drain spacing.  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:57).

Procedure for determining drain spacing  
 Formulation of basic design criteria (q and H)  
 Establishment of field drainage base W; and h=W -H 
 Establishment of soil parameters K and D  
 Selection of drain type (pipe or ditch) and determination of ‘u’  
 Determine drain spacing by Hooghoudt formula  
The solution of the Hooghoudt formula is either trial and error or a graphical solution.  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:30)  
 
Here is the trial and error solution 
 Since L depends on d; d depends  on L, the Hooghoudt equation is an implicit equation.  
 Assume a value of L and determine d from the equation  
𝑑=𝐷
8𝐷
𝜋𝐿ln𝐷
𝑢+1   for D > L/4  
𝑑=𝜋𝐿
8ln𝐿
𝑢   for D < L/4  
 Solve the Hooghoudt formula for L and compare the value with the assumed value of L  
 Mod ify the value of ‘L’ and repeat the steps until the calculated and assumed values are 
equal.  
Suppose if these are not equal you have to change this initial guess of L and then repeat the 
steps and find out new L dash right and again compare the previous L and the calculated L. So, 
these steps need to be repeated until these two ones are closer or almost equal.  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:14).  
 
So, there is a graphical solution also available. So, since the Hooghoudt equation contains 2 
terms  that are 8𝐾2ℎ
𝑞 & 4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞 so, 2 graphs are  available  based  on the length;  Graph A is for 𝐿=
5 𝑡𝑜 25 𝑚 and Graph B is for 𝐿 = 10 𝑡𝑜 100  𝑚. So, based on the assumed length, you can go 
ahead with these 2 graphs. In the graph y1-axis contains 8𝐾2ℎ
𝑞  and y 2-axis contains 4𝐾1ℎ2
𝑞. 
Similarly  in the other graph the same things ok.  So, first , calculate 8𝐾2ℎ
𝑞, and calculate other 
terms and locate  these  2 points . Draw a line connecting these two values  and then m ark the 
point where the line crosses the ‘D’ value . Find L value corresponding to this (i.e. parallel to 
other ‘L’ lines) . This graphical solution is easier compared to the previous analytical solution.  
So, in this lecture, we observed the design criteria , design principles , and what are the steps 
involv ed in designing subsurface drainage system s then the Hooghoudt assumptions , and the 
Hooghoudt formula.  Since the Hooghoudt assumption  is for making the horizontal flow; so  
Hooghoudt assumed the tile drainage system to be a n open ditch system by taking the ti le drain 
to the impervious surface and the n finding out the equivalent depth. He has given the formulas 
for calculating equivalent depth d value, based on the length and drain space drain depth. Based 
on these two things  it will help find  out the drain spa cing by following either trial and error 
method or use a graphical solution.  
Thank you so much.
