Lecture - 48: Sub - Subsurface Drainage Design  
Hi, this is lecture number 48 on S ub-Surface Drainage  Design  so, we will be working on the 
unsteady -state flow to drains . In the previous lecture , we have talked  about steady -state conditions , 
now unsteady state conditions .  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:34 ) 
 
For example , in the case of  a falling water table , it is observed  that during irrigation  there is a 
sudden fall in the water table , Glover -Dumm equation will be used to simulate the falling water 
table after sudden rise due to an instantaneous recharge  or irrigation  in case of the drains . In the 
steady -state con dition , we assume that the system is under equilibrium  then the q or recharge 
taking place will be equal to drainage out , but if there is a sudden instantaneous change in the 
recharge that influence s the drain discharge . So, this is a typical situation whe re you apply 
irrigation and the shallow water table goes down and then  after irrigation , it again falls .   
So, in the schematic  above,  if you see , the tail drain  point , the halfway of tail drain  and there is 
another t ail drain on the other  side. T he water table at the midpoint is having the head h t, and d is 
the drain depth.  𝑑ℎ𝑥
𝑑𝑥 is the change in the water table with distance , from the image above  if you 
see x is going in the x -axis direction and h vertically upwards . 
So, we are going to see how the change in q is influencing the h ; when h<d<<L, the flow to the 
drains is essentially horizontal and it follows that  
𝑄𝑥=𝐾𝐷ℎ𝛿ℎ𝑥
𝛿𝑥                           (1) 
This is from  Darcy’s  law, Dh is the elemental depth , and then  for the unit width , K is the hydraulic 
gradient . 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:47 ) 
 
Then after that , if you use the water balance  for element ∆x below the water table  
(𝑄𝑥+∆x−𝑄𝑥)+𝑞.∆x=𝛿ℎ𝑥
𝛿𝑡∆x. μ

𝛿𝑡 μ

∆x→0:𝛿𝑄 𝑥
𝛿𝑥+𝑞 =𝛿ℎ𝑥
𝛿𝑡 μ  
              (2) 
Combining (1) and (2),  
 
  𝛿(𝐾𝐷ℎ𝛿ℎ𝑥

𝛿𝑥+𝑞 =𝛿ℎ𝑥

𝛿ℎ𝑥
𝛿𝑡=𝐾𝐷ℎ
μ 𝛿2ℎ𝑥
𝛿𝑥2+𝑞

Eqn. (3) is called the Boussinesq equation which describes the water table under unsteady 
recharge.  
Integrating eq. 3 for no recharge q=0 and the boundary conditions:  
So, now, you are going to integrate  for no recharge q = 0, and the boundary  conditions  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:35 ) 
 
Initial condition: ℎ(𝑥,0) = ℎ0 
Boundary condition: ℎ(0,𝑡) = 0; ℎ(𝐿,𝑡) = 0 
This yields the Glover -Dumm equation  
According to Glover -Dumm, the mid spacing water table head h t at time t relates to the head h 0 
(at t=0) as:  
ℎ𝑡
ℎ0=1.16𝑒−𝛼𝑡;              α = 𝜋2𝐾𝑑
μ𝐿2 = 10𝐾𝑑
μ𝐿2 
Where, t = time, d; h 0 = initial water table head, m; h t = water table head at t, m; α is the reaction 
factor (d-1); μ is the drainable porosity (m3/m3); L = drain spacing, m; d = equivalent depth to 
impermeable substratum, m; K = hydraulic conductivity, m/d  
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:04 ) 
 
Combining the above equations,  
𝐿2=10𝐾𝑑𝑡
μ(𝑙𝑛1.16ℎ0
ℎ𝑡)−1 
The s hape of the falling water table  fourth -order parabola  
Pipe drain : Radial distances are taken into account by replacing the depth D to the impermeable 
substrate by Hooghoudt equivalent depth ‘d’, which makes the Glover -Dumm equation applicable 
to pipe drainage.  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:47 ) 
 
Exercise 48.1 :  
Find the drain spacing: t = 0; H 0 = 0 (water table at soil surface) and t = 4; H = 0.8 m  
 
 
Solution : 
h0 = W – H0 = 1.2 – 0 = 1.2 m  
h4 = W – H4 = 1.2 – o.8 = 0.4 m  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:56 ) 
 
ℎ4
ℎ0=0.4
1.2=1.16𝑒−𝛼𝑡 
0.33=1.16𝑒−𝛼𝑡 
𝑒−𝛼𝑡= 0.33/1.16  => 𝛼𝑡=1.24 
When t = 4;  𝛼 = 0.31  
𝐿2=10𝐾𝑑
μα=10×2×𝑑
0.31×0.05=1290 ×𝑑 
Since L = f(d) and d = f(L), a trial and error procedure is followed

First trial :   
L = 30 m,  d=2.2 m (from Hooghoudt equation)  
L = (1290×2.2)0.5= 53.3 m  
Second trial :  
L = 60 m,  d=2.84 m  
L = (1290×2.84)-1 = 60.5 m  
The solution is L  = 60 m  
 (Refer Slide Time: 14:41 ) 
 
Glover -Dumm  formula and the Hooghoudt formula can be interrelated, enabling the non -steady 
basic design criteria to be translated into steady -state criteria.  
Hooghoudt (simple) equation :   
𝐿2=8𝐾𝑑ℎ

Glover -Dumm equation :   
𝐿2=10𝐾𝑑

For μ = 0.05 and α = 0.31,  ℎ
q = 80.65  
In Hooghoudt equation with K = 2 m/d,  
𝐿2=8𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑞 
𝐿2=8×2×80.65×𝑑 
=1290 ×𝑑 
This is an implicit equation as L = f(d) and L = f (f (L)); which is the same as the equation obtained 
in Ex. 47.1  
Use the trial and error method to find L  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:32 ) 
 
And then another one is the fluctuating water table so one is the falling water table that we have 
seen using  the Glover -Dumm  equation , the other one is fluctuating water table . This is estimated  
by using the de Zeeuw and H ellinga formula .  
Hooghoudt (simple) formula 𝐿2=8𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝑞, may  be developed to show the non -steady response to 
periodic rainfall or irrigation  
In this equation, the drain discharge (q) is linearly related to the mid -spacing water table head (h t); 
  𝑞=8𝐾𝑑ℎ𝑡
𝐿2 
The variation of the drain discharge with time is thus also linearly related to the variati on in time 
of water table head  
𝑑𝑞
𝑑𝑡=8𝐾𝑑
𝐿2𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑡      (1) 
If the groundwater body is recharged by rainfall/irrigation (R) and is completed by drain discharge 
(q), 
Water table fall  (R-q) < 0;             
Water table rise  (R-q) > 0  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:43 ) 
 
The water table fluctuation may  be described by 𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑡 = (𝑅−𝑞)
𝑐μ     (2) 
Where μ is the drainable porosity; C is the correction factor (0.7 to 0.9 for h at mid spacing).  
During a recession, the water table will not remain horizontal but  fall more rapidly nearer to drains. 
Combining the above equations (1 and 2): take c = 0.8  
𝑑𝑞
𝑑𝑡=10𝐾𝑑
μ𝐿2(𝑅−𝑞) 
=α(𝑅−𝑞) 
So the change in drain discharge 𝑑𝑞
𝑑𝑡 is proportional to (R -q).  
Integrating the above equation between the limits: t = t and t = t-1; q = q t and q = q t-1. 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:23 ) 
 
∫𝑑𝑞
(𝑅−𝑞)𝑞𝑡
𝑞𝑡−1=∫𝛼.𝑑𝑡𝑡
𝑡−1 
(𝑅−𝑞)𝑡
(𝑅−𝑞)𝑡−1=𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡 
𝑞𝑡=𝑞𝑡−1𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡+𝑅∆𝑡(1−𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡) 
Since 𝑞=8𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝐿2=0.8𝛼𝜇ℎ (𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚  𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡  𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ) 
ℎ𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡+𝑅∆𝑡
0.8𝛼𝜇 (1−𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡) 
The above two equations may  be used to simulate drain discharge and water table depth 
fluctuations based on  weather records given the value of the reaction factor α. So, this way  not 
only the recharge , but the water table  position at a  particular time can also  estimate .  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:22 ) 
 
Exercise 48.2:  Water table head and drain outflow calculations based on  de Zeeuw – Hellinga 
formula  
For Parallel pipe drainage system  
Given:   
W = 1.2 m,  
L = 40 m,  
Kd = 2.5 m2/d and  
"μ" = 5  % 
Calculations:  
α=10𝐾𝑑
μ𝐿2=10×2.5
0.05×1600=0.31; ∆𝑡=1 𝑑𝑎𝑦 
e-α∆t = e-0.31 = 0.73  (1-e-α∆t) = 0.27 and 0.8 μα = 0.012  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:24 ) 
 
At the start of the rain (day 0), the water table head is 0.1 m or the mid spacing water table depth 
H=W -h=1.2 -0.1= 1.1 m below the soil surface.  
The corresponding drain outflow  
𝑞=8𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝐿2=8×2.5×0.1
1600 
= 0.001 m/d  
ℎ𝑡=ℎ𝑡−1𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡+𝑅∆𝑡
0.8𝛼𝜇 (1−𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡) 
For t = 1:  
ℎ1=(0.1×0.73)+(0.04
0.012×0.27)=0.16 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:59 ) 
 
So, we need to concentrate  on the table  above, the days are on the first column and the rainfall on 
the second column , evaporation  is on the third column and the rest we need to estimate ; recharge , 
water table  head , and drain outflow .  
So, on day 1 you have 0.005  m rainfall and  the evaporation is 0.001  mm, and the recharge will be 
0.004  that is  the difference  between  rainfall and  evaporation .  
And then as mentioned in the earlier slide the water table head  and drain outflow is estimated  
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:49 ) 
 
For t = 2:  
ℎ2=(0.16×0.73)+(0.019
0.012×0.27)=0.54 
For t = 6:  
ℎ6=0.56 
For t = 7:  
ℎ7=0.41 𝑒𝑡𝑐 
𝑞𝑡=𝑞𝑡−1𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡+𝑅∆𝑡(1−𝑒−𝛼∆𝑡) 
For t = 1:  
𝑞1=(0.001×0.73)+(0.04×0.27)=0.002 
For t = 2:  
𝑞2=(0.002×0.73)+(0.019×0.27)=0.007 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:01 ) 
 
For t = 6:  
𝑞6=0.007 
For t = 7:  
𝑞7=0.005  𝑒𝑡𝑐 
At the end of 10th day, q = 0.002 m/d. i.e. evaporation may  be expected to start 
So, this is all about the lecture , we focused on unsteady -state condition s. So, first, the Glover -
Dumm  equation  in case of falling headwater  table condition  which  happen s when the irrigation is 
taking place . Another one is the Hellinga formula for the sudden  fluctuating water table . So, for 
both cases , we derived the  equations  for spacing . In the case of the Hellinga  formula , we will be  
finding out  both water table fluctuations as well as the drainage  water fluctuations and we have 
shown th ose fluctuations  by solving a problem . 
Thank you  so much .
