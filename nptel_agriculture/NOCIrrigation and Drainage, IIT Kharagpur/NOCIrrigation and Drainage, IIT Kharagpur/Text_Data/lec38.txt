Agricultural Drainage:  Related Concepts  
 
Hi, welcome to lecture number 38. This is on Agricultural  Drainage ’s related concepts. So  we 
are going to see how th e soil water which is present in the soil can experience different kind s 
of forces or pressures , though I have talked about this in the previous lectures . Since we a re 
going to talk about drainage  which is  remov ing water from the ground surface or within the 
soil root zone , this definitely will create wetting and drying phases simultaneously. So to 
understand that process, we need to know some fundamental things before going to the detail s 
on drainages.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 01:22)  
 
The pressure in the soil water is expressed as force per unit area ; where pressure P is in Pascals 
or if P is the head of water in m you can convert it to pascal by multiplying it with ρw which  is 
the unit weight of water in kg /m3 and g which is the acceleration due to gravity  in m/s2. So, if 
you calculate the product of all these 3  it will give the pressure in Pascals.  
1 bar = 105 Pa ~ 1 atm = 10 m head  
The negative pressure in the soi l moisture  is also conventionally expressed by the pF value.  
pF = log 10P, where P is the head in cm  
 
The graph  above  indicate s the water content on the x-axis and tension on the y-axis for different 
soils – sand, silt and clay . The curve is the  pF curve  with the logarithm of tension  in head units . 
The pressure at the permanent wilting point is 104.2. Since  at 10000 atmosphere s onwards the 
plants start wilting.  The field capacity level has some range between 1.82 to 2.5 pF or 60 to 
300 cm water height and then below this is all saturated soil moisture.  
(Refer Slide Time: 04:09)  
 
Next is  what kind of pressure we experience when you are going above the water table and 
below the water table . Suppose in th e picture  above there  is a ground surface and assume s that 
there is a mano meter, which is installed down in the soil  (tensiometer ) and th ere is a  water table  
or phreatic surface and the pressure at this point is atmospher ic pressure. The piezometer 
install ed will indicate the water level . And then if you see the pressures , so ex actly at  the surface 
of the water table, you have atmosphere pressure the difference in pressure will be 0. If you 
come down  the pressure is positive and above the water table which  is the unsaturated 
condition , it will experience a negative pressure.  
Suppose there  is a plant, definitely the plant experiences the negative pressure . So, basically , 
if you see the pressure at the water table is always atmospheric pressure and the pressure below 
water is positive . So, that means, if you have a water body and you w ant to insert a ball  because 
of the buoyancy force the ball  experience the opposite pressure and it is difficult to immerse it; 
that means, there is positive pressure which is acting on the ball. This positive pressure  is 
measured with a piezometer whereas , negative pressure which is experienc ed in the unsaturated 
soil that will be measured with a tensiometer. So, the pressure above the water table is 
obviously, less than atmospheric pressure and the negative pressure is also called soil moisture 
tension or  suction this is measured with a tensiometer . 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:33)  
 
And then next is the pressure in the soil, there are 3 forces. As I mentioned in the previous 
slides, the capillary force , adsorptive force , and osmotic forces. Suppose, you have a soil 
initially filled with water  completely or completely saturated, in that case , when there is input 
water, the extra water which is on the top of the soil will be push due to gravity.  So, the water 
is going to pass into the soil body and when there is no input whatever water  is experiencing 
gravity will be percolating down  and the remaining water will be held with the soil particles . 
The water which is held with the soil particles  will contain some  air space and there is no water 
there. The water which is held by th e capillary forces is because, th ere are  2 different materials 
- soil and water. So, the soil experience s the adsorptive forces . 
Then  osmotic force  is basically due to the soil salinity. So, if you have salts present in the wate r, 
that definitely does not allow water to flow out . If you see th e picture  above  so assume that 
there is a tub of water and you put tubes of different diameters . If you observe the water  level  
in the tube with a lower diameter, has higher water compared to the other  diameters  This clearly 
indicates when the soil pores are of a lesser diameter that will help in raising the water through 
capillary forces. So, the capillary action is also referred to as a capillary motion or capillarity.  
This is because of the combination of cohesion and adhe sion of surface tension forces , if you 
see water in a glass tube  it has some bending or curvature.  The cohesion forces are the forces 
between similar molecules and adhesion  is the force between  different molecules like glass and 
water. So the capillary action is demonstrated by the upward movement of water through a  
narrow tube against the force of gravity. So, this is an example of how these capillary forces 
act on the different diameter s of pipe or glasses, the capillary  rise will be high  in lower diameter  
tube. 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:28)  
 
Capillary action  occurs  when the adhesive intermolecular forces between liquid such as water 
and the solid surface  of the tube are stronger than, the cohesive intermolecular between the 
water molecules . The following equation is used to estimate the capillary rise.  
ℎ𝑐=−2𝛾𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃
 𝜌 𝑔 𝑟 
where 𝛾 is surface tension, N/m; h c capillary rise, m; r radius of curvature, m; 
 𝜌 unit  weight  of water ,kg
m3;g acceleration  due to gravity ,m
s2 
θ indicates the surface  tangent of curvature .  
So, if θ= 90, hc will be 0; that means  no rise,  so there is no surface tension no rise . If θ = 0,  
you get the maximum surface tension;  that means , ℎ𝑐=−2𝛾
 𝜌 𝑔 𝑟. So, this is the maximum rise you 
can expect when theta equal to 0.  
In a pore, the curvature of a meniscus att ains a maximum value when its radius equal to the 
radius of the pore ( 𝜽 = 0)  
ℎ𝑐=−4𝛾
 𝜌 𝑔 𝐷𝑜𝑟 −3000
𝐷 
where  D is the diameter of the pore in microns  
So, knowing the diameter of a pore you can you can predict the water rise or capillary rise, i n 
the soil media.  
  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:32)  
 
Next is the adsorptive forces, this includes Van der Waals which are weak forces and 
electrostatic forces exerted on the water by the cha rged colloidal surfaces of the soil particles. 
The tensiometer  is generally used to measure th e matric suction which include s both capillary 
and adsorptive forces.  
Then t he osmotic pressure is mainly due to the salts present in the water. In the soil water, it 
occurs when the different concentrations  of the solution are separated by a semi -permeable  
layer . Assume that there is a semi -permeable membrane between the freshwater and the 
saltwater, then after some time , there is an interaction  between the  fresh water molecules  and 
the salt molecules . So, after equilibrium, yo u see the rise in the water level of salt water so th e 
semi -permeable membrane is acting as a barrier. The rise in saltwater creates extra suction  and 
this negative pressure is causing the suction . So, the random motion of the water solute 
molecules create s a net movement of water to the component with higher concentration until 
equilibrium is reached, once it reach es equilibrium you will see the fall in freshwater and rise 
in saltwater and that fall causes the suction.   
At equilibrium the net water m ovement is eliminated by the increase in water pressure , this is 
an example of reverse osmosis. So, in the case of reverse osmosis which you generally  see in 
the water filters , by increasing the water pressure  in the salt water whatever the fresh molecules 
of the dirty water will be going to the fresh water molecule leaving the salt molecules on the 
other side.  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:41)  
 
Next is the total water potential  (Ψt), which is equal to the gravitational potential , matric 
potential , and osmotic pote ntial.  
Ψt = Ψg+ Ψm+ Ψo 
Where Ψg is gravitational potential; Ψm is the matric potential, Ψo is the osmotic potential  
The relationship between the soil moisture θ and Ψm is the soil moisture characteristic curve. 
The suction is on the y -axis and the  θ is on the x -axis. So, initially , the water is saturated let 
say the maximum water content  at point a  then after that, if you remove water it moves to point  
b and the corresponding pressure . And if you remove water further from there , so, it goes to 
point c and d  and corresponding tension . The soil moisture characteristic curve  is a curve 
between θ and Ψ.  So, Ψ here is used to predict the soil water storages . 
So, here the m atric suction is Ψm only, Ψg and Ψo we are not considering here  
And then, due to the hysteresis when you remove the water the curve follows the draining curve 
as shown in the figure above and when you  start adding the water slowly, it is supposed to 
follow the same curv e, but it does not becau se of the hysteresis effect. T his hysteresis is a more 
common case of clay soils tha n sandy soils . For drainage  purpose s, the drying curve is more 
relevant because in the drainage we remove water from the root zone . The wetting curve and  
drying curve  are shown above . 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:13)  
 
So, the drying curve is more relevant in the case of drainage.  The graph above is the soil 
moisture characteristic curve, with the soil of water conte nt in percentages on the x-axis and 
soil m atric potential that is in bars on the y -axis for different soils . The graph shows the soil 
moisture characteristic curve for sand, loam, clay, silt along with the permanent wilting point 
and field capacity and saturat ion range  
Capillary rise of water in soil:

At -100 cm h c, 30μ pores will completely drain.  
At -10 cm h c, 300 μ pores will completely drain  
At -10,000 cm h c, 0.3μ pores will completely drain.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 26:09)  
 
Soil water potential – the potential diagram  is shown above  to understand soil water potential. 
The ground surface and water table are shown in the first image above, l et us assume point A 
is in the  unsaturated zone  and point B in the  saturated  zone . Then definitely we exp erience  
negative pr essure at point A  and positive pressure at point B. So, taking the water table as a 
reference , you have to do positive work to take or lift water from th e water table to point  A, 
that is why Z A is positive.  Whereas  at point B since the water table  is on top you need to do 
negative work , the pressure is positive here  since it is more than atmospheric pressure, but the 
elevation head will be negative  because as I mentioned when you put the ball insid e, it is very 
hard to push it to down due to the opposite pressure acting on top . 
So, putting everything together is called the potential diagram . So, Ψt is an equilibrium, once 
the soil moisture which is present in the soil is in equilibrium  Ψ at any point will be this is total 
water potential . ZA is positive  whereas, P A is the negative side and then the other side so the P B 
is the positive side and Z B is the negative side. So, the advantage of this is at any distance  you 
will be able to find out what is the P B and corresponding what is the Z B  
And then at th e equilibrium  point Ψt=0; that means so Z A is positive, at this point Z A = PA. So, 
similarly here Z B = PB. So, this is the field capacity situation, once the loose water came out  
exactly at the equilibrium condition  Ψt = 0 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:58)  
 
Ψt is the work required to move a unit quantity of water from the reference state to that point  
Ψt = (Ψg + Ψm) 
Ψg energy needed to move against gravity;  Ψm energy needed to move against pressure  
If you recall the previous picture  
For point A: ΨA = Z A+ (-PA) 
For point B: ΨB = -ZB+ (P B) 
PB is positive here because this is below the water table PA is negative because it is a bove the 
water table .  
Under field capacity situation and no evapotranspiration, the water will percolate until P A= Z A 
At point A, Ψt = (Ψg + Ψm) = Z A+ (-ZA ) = 0  
For zero flow in the ground water (point B): Ψt = (Ψg + Ψm) = -ZB+ (Z B ) = 0  
(Refer Slide Time: 31:26)  
 
And then, Darcy’s law , states the principle that govern s how the fluid moves in th e subsurface . 
We are assuming that  the soil is saturated , flow-through soil is laminar and is continuous and 
stead y; so, this under this assumption.   
It relies on the fact that the amount of flow between two points is directly related to the 
difference in pressure between the points, the distance between the points, and the 
interconnectivity of flow pathways in the ro ck between the points.   
𝑄=−𝐾.ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡−ℎ𝑖𝑛
𝐿.𝐴=−𝐾.△ℎ
𝐿.𝐴=𝐾𝑖𝐴 
Where, Q  = Discharge per unit time (cm3/s); A = Area of c/s of soil mass (cm2); i = Hydraulic 
gradient ( -); K = Darcy’s coefficient of Permeability (cm/s)  
So, the Q is direct directly proportional to the K and Q = K when the hydraulic gradient is unity 
A = 1 and dh by L . 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:39)  
 
Hydraulic Conductivity (K)  depends on the geometry and distribution of water -filled pores. 
So, the hydraulic  conductivity as I mentioned in the previous slide is the ratio of Darcy’s 
velocity to the applied hydraulic gradient. So, for a unit hydraulic gradient which is having a 
unit cross -sectional area ; the flow through the saturated media is equal to the hydraulic 
cond uctivity.  So, if you see the  Ks, at m /day for the coarse sand it is 10 to 15 and for dense clay 
is less than 0.0002 ; that means, it is definitely influenc ed by  the soil texture  and also the pores . 
Larger  pores are easier to pass through and you ha ve higher  hydraulic conductivity  than, pore 
space which is smaller ; so that is difficult for water to flow in to the soil  example, clay  soil. And 
in case of drainage point of view, the temperature effect is negligible and value are low when 
the water has to follow a tortuous path through the soil.  
(Refer Slide Time: 35:35)  
 
So, how to measure the Saturate Hydraulic Conductivity ? The simple method is the constant 
head permeameter method. So, from the field , you collect soil core sample this core sample  
will be attach ed to the 2 filters and then to the  storage reservoir  or the outlet reservoir.  
So, the water will be flowing continuously from the bottom and then  the difference in water 
levels  △h will be know n and you know the sample area of cross -section , length  and then the 
outflow Q. Ks will be calculated as follows  
𝐾𝑆=𝑄𝐿
△ℎ 𝐴 
(Refer Slide Time: 36:38)  
 
The other way to measure saturated hydraulic conductiv ity is the inverse auger hole. So, in the 
field you make a hole with diameter 2r  initially put the water , let the media completely 
saturated , and after some  time start the experiment. So, initially , you filled the hole with some 
water level y 1 and then after some time note down th e next depth y 2, that is △y. 
Ks is estimated as follows  
𝐾𝑆=1.15𝑟tan𝛼 
tan𝛼=(log(𝑦1+0.5𝑟)−log(𝑦2+0.5𝑟))
𝑡−𝑡0 
Where, 𝑟= radius of the hole, cm  
𝑦1= height of water column at the initial time ( 𝑡0) 
𝑦2= height of water table at time t, sec  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:37)  
 
And there  is another method. It is the ring infiltrometer method. So, in the ring infiltrometer 
what we do. So at a particular time  interval , you find out the infiltration rate  till it remains  
constant  then this constant rat e is called basic infiltration rate, generally we take it as K S  
(Refer Slide Time: 38:08)  
 
The table above is the ring infiltration meter data and finally, the last points  indicate constant 
infiltration rate  so the KS here is 10 mm /h. So, if we see the graph  it is going to fall and the last 
point s with  almost constant infiltration rate are equal to K S. 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:44)  
 
There is software  available called ROSETTA  this software  requires soil texture information , 
like percentage of sand , silt, clay, and bulk density. So, knowing these values you can predict 
the van Genuchten parameters a nd then finally, the K S. Also, you can estimate using the soil 
information so, this is pretty easy and straight forward.  
So, pedotrans fer functions mean  knowing the soil information like percentage of sand, silt and 
clay, and organic carbon, you can  derive other soil hydraulic parameters or soil physical 
properties . So this is all in this lecture.  
Thank you so much.
