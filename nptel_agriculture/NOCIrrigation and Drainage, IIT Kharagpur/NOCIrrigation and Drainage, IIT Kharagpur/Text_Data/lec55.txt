Lecture - 55 Tutorial  
Friends this is lecture number 55 - Tutorial on what we learn during this is this week. We are 
going to see problems and the solutions related to hydrologic design, hydraulic design of this 
surface drainage system , and cost and benefit ratio of drainage project.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:53)  
 
Example W11.1:  
Find the section dimension  of a drainage channel to carry runoff from a 50 ha water shed with 
a drainage coefficient of 5 lps/ha. The given parameters are channel bed slope, S = 0.2%; 
channel side slope, z=1; maximum permissible mean velocity, V=0.6 m/sec and Manning’s 
roughness co efficient, n=0.025.  
Solution:  
𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛  𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐 ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒  =5×50=250  𝑙𝑝𝑠 
=0.25  m3/sec 
From Manning’s formula  
𝑉 = 1
𝑛 𝑅23⁄𝑆12⁄ 
0.6 = 1
0.025 𝑅23⁄0.00212⁄ 
      0.6 =1.79 𝑅23⁄ 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 02:53)  
 
𝑅23⁄= 0.6
1.79=0.3350 ; 𝑅=0.194 
From continuity equation  
𝑄=𝐴×𝑉 
𝐴=𝑄
𝑉=0.25
0.6=0.4167  
Also, for the Trapezoid channel  
𝐴=𝑏𝑑+𝑧𝑑2 
0.4167 =𝑏𝑑+1×𝑑2 
𝑏=(0.4167 −𝑑2) 
𝑑 
𝑅=𝐴
𝑃=𝑏𝑑+𝑧𝑑2 
𝑏+2𝑑(𝑧2+1)12⁄ 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:55)  
 
Substituting for b in R and writing R = 0.19407  
𝑅=((0.4167 −𝑑2) 
𝑑)𝑑+1×𝑑2 
((0.4167 −𝑑2) 
𝑑)+2.828 𝑑=0.4167  d 
(0.4167 +1.828  𝑑2) 
𝑑2−1.1746  𝑑+0.22796 =0 
By solving the above equ ation  
𝑑=0.9269  m and 0.2477  m 
Now substituting in the equation to find a b value  
𝑏=(0.4167 −𝑑2) 
𝑑 𝑏=(0.4167 −0.92692) 
0.9269;   𝑏=−0.477  𝑚 
The first root is not feasible as it is a substitution in the area relation that gives negative b.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 05:57)  
 
Hence, 𝑑= 0.2477 𝑚 ≈0.248  𝑚=24.8 𝑐𝑚 
𝑏=(0.4167 −𝑑2) 
𝑑;  𝑏=(0.4167 −0.2482) 
0.248;  𝑏=1.43 𝑚 
• 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤  𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 =1.43×0.248 +1×0.2482  =0.416 m2 
• 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤  𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 0.25

• 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤  𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =0.6 m/sec  
According to freeboard 5% depth to the design depth, the construction depth = 26 cm (or say 
30cm)

𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑝 𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  =1.43×0.3+1×0.32 
𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑝 𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡 ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  =0.519 m2

Example W11.2:  
Calculate the peak rate of runoff for a 10-year recurrence interval from a drainage basin of 40 
ha area. The land is flat (0 -5% slope) and consists of cultivated clay soil. The maximum 
length of flow is 800 m and the difference in elevation between the most remote point and 
outlet is 7.5 m. Assu me rainfall intensity is 6.5 cm/h.  
Solution:  
𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒  𝑠𝑙𝑜𝑝𝑒 , 𝑆 =𝐻
𝐿 
= 7.5
800 
=0.009375  
𝑇𝑐=   0.0195   𝐿0.77𝑆−0.385 
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:57)  
 
𝑇𝑐=   0.0195   𝐿0.77𝑆−0.385 
𝑇𝑐=   0.0195   8000.770.009375−0.385 
=20.24 𝑚𝑖𝑛 
From the ta ble for arable land, 0 -5% slope , and clay soil, the value of runoff coefficient, C is 
0.50.  
𝑄𝑝=  𝐶𝐼𝐴

𝑄𝑝=  0.50×65×40

𝑄𝑝=3.61 m3 /s 
𝑄𝑝=1.3×104 m3 /h (Ans.)

Example W11.3:  
Assuming an Interest rate of 5.5 percent, the average cost for irrigation works ₹1,125 per 
hectare, total drainage cost of ₹875 per hectare, operation and maintenance annual cost ₹23.75 
per hectare  
Distribution of acreages by economic land class  
Class  Hectares  
  Net direct benefits by land class:  
(Annual benefit per hectare) in ₹  Total annual benefit  
[hectare s x annual benefit]  
1 96 181.25  17,400  
2 40 156.50  6,260  
2 120 107.75  12930  
Total      ₹36,590  
Average annual benefit = ₹36,590/256 = ₹142.93 per hectare  
Find an estimate of the economic feasibility over the 100 -year life expectancy of the drainage 
system  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:25)  
 
Solution:  
Present worth (PW of capitalized average annual benefit):  
PW = interest f actor x annual benefit  
𝑃𝑊 = (1+𝑖)𝑛−1
 𝑖(1+𝑖)𝑛× ₹142 .93  
𝑃𝑊 = ₹2586 .46 𝑝𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑒  
where:  
           n = number of interest periods in years, and  
           I = interest rate at which compounding takes place over the period, 12, ex pressed as a 
decimal fraction.  
The p resent worth of capitalized annual O&M costs:  
𝑃𝑊 = (1+𝑖)𝑛−1
 𝑖(1+𝑖)𝑛×  ₹23.75 
𝑃𝑊 =₹429 .78 𝑝𝑒𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑒  
  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:25)  
 
cost summary:  
                               Drainage = ₹875 per hectare  
                               Irrigation = ₹1,125 per hec tare 
                               O&M = ₹430 per hectare  
                                Total = ₹2,430 per hectare

Drainage projects having B/C ratios greater than 1 are generally considered feasible
