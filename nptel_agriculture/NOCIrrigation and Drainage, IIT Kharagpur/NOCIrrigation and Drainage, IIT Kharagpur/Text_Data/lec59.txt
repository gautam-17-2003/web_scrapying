Lecture - 59 Irrigation Economics  
In the previous l ectures we have talked about the economics of drainage project and now we 
are going to cover Irrigation Economics in this lecture  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:29)  
 
Economics is the fundamental decision criterion of irrigation and drainage engineering. So, 
engineering economics analysis uses the  project life and expected rate of returns to compute 
the expected present and future cost and benefits of the proposed irrigation and drainage 
system. So, knowing the project period and rate of return and you are going to bring both cost 
and benefits to t he present value and compare. And, see whether it is beneficial to invest in this 
particular irrigation project or not and we are going to compute the cost -benefit ratio and also 
net present value. We are going to compute, these two indicators in irrigatio n economics as 
well as drainage economics. So, if the system is profitable at the required rate of return then 
the decision is made to invest in the system.  
So, this is the overall project, but individually or seasonally if you want to estimate the cost o f 
production, we need the crop water production functions with water and energy cost 
information to enable us to calculate the optimum depth of water applications. This is not only 
to estimate the production cost but also to estimate the economic depth of water to be applied. 
So, that the yield and profit will be maximum.  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 02:38)  
 
In the crop water production functions here , for example, the crop yield is a function of water 
applied during the cropping season. So, for example, in the  first figure above , if you see the 
applied depth of water , as well as ET,  are on the x-axis and then the cotton yield that is called 
lint yield in kg /ha is in the y-axis. 
 In these graphs , there are two curves : one represents the ET and the other one is applied  water.  
So, here for a particular applied depth of water  the ET-based irrigation results in the maximum 
lint yield as compared to the water applied in the field , which  means, it has some losses from 
this total water or  the gross water applied in the  field. So, that includes pre -irrigation and other 
losses like runoff, de ep percolation all other losses.   
Then in figure 2 above you see the profit on the y-axis and depth of water applied on the x-
axis. So, if you see the crop price , it contains two comp onents , and when you subtract the water 
price from the crop price you get the profit.  
From the profit graph /curve  you can see at what depth the profit is maximum. So, for example , 
at 70 depth of applied water , the profit is maximum. So that means, the 70 centimeter of water 
needs to be applied to get the economic yield and also the maximum  profit.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:50)  
 
And the next we are going to see  is the crop production functions,  given  by Grimes and El -Zik, 
1990 , especially for cotton. So, here Y a is the actual yield in kg/ha which is given as follows  
𝑌𝑎=−3954 +1067  (𝐴𝑊 𝑒)0.5−54.14(𝐴𝑊 𝑒) 
So, this relationship is obtain ed from the experiments and AW e represents the applied water in 
field experiments  measured in c m. Sometimes  irrigation is often supplemented by precipitation, 
so during precipitation , you do not have to give irrigation  and you  need to add that precipitation 
or effective precipitation  (Pe) in applied water then the production function  is 
𝑌𝑎=−3954 +1067 (𝐴𝑊 𝑒+𝑃𝑒)0.5−54.14(𝐴𝑊 𝑒+𝑃𝑒). 
So, (Aw e + Pe) is the total water applied in the above equation are obtained from the field 
experiments.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:22)  
 
These production function what we have obtained is based on 90 % irrigation efficiency, then 
the relationship between the gross depth of irrigation water applied  (AW)  and AW e is as follows  
𝐴𝑊 = 𝐴𝑊 𝑒
[100 −(90−𝜂)]
100  
or 
𝐴𝑊 𝑒=𝐴𝑊 −𝐴𝑊(0.9−𝜂) 
We assume that the experimentally determined AW is related to 90 % irrigation efficiency. So, 
η is the irrigation efficiency  of the actual  field irrigation system which is in fraction . 
Pre-irrigation may be needed to germinate the crop , this pre - irrigation also comes under gross  
irrigation depth, most of this water is o ften wasted as leachate or runoff. Then the adjusted 
gross water depth applied to the field is  
𝐴𝑊 =𝐴𝑊 𝑒
[100 −(90−𝜂)]
100+𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  
So, AW is the gross water depth  applied to the field for  a particular crop, whereas, AW e is the 
depth of w ater or actual depth of water applied to the crop during the experiments.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:23)  
 
Irrigation cost /water cost is normally calculated on a volume basis, that is in m3 or ac -ft or ha-
cm, if the unit of applied water  is cm  then the cost of water  (WC)  in $/ha is given as follow  
𝑊𝐶($
ℎ𝑎⁄)= $
𝑚3⁄ ×100 ×𝐴𝑊 
So, since we are looking for computing for 1 hectare. So, the centimeter is been converted into 
meters by  multiplying with  100 since 1 hectare is 10,000  m2.  If only water c ost is considered 
then profit  Pr ($/ha)  is calculated as.  
 
𝑃𝑟= 𝑌𝑎×($
ℎ𝑎⁄)−𝑊𝐶 ($
ℎ𝑎⁄) 
So, generally , profit is equal to production cost minus water cost . During the season when you 
get the yield and the resale value of the yield or value of the yield minus the cost of water that 
will give the profit only if you are considering the water as the cost.  
The maximum profit can be found by setting the derivative.  
𝑑(𝑃𝑟)
𝑑(𝐴𝑊)=0 
 The graph between AW and the profit is maximum  at one point where the derivative  will be 0. 
So, that point will give  economic AW for which the profit will be maximum.  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:43)  
 
Example 59.1: Find the depth of applied water (AW) that results in  maximum profit with a drip 
irrigation system for the cotton CWPF by Grimes and El -Zik (1990). Assume that 7.5 cm of 
precipitation infiltrates during the growing season. The cost of water is $0.0327/m3. The selling 
price of cotton is $0.92/kg. Assume that irrigation depth is 0 cm and AW = AW e. The drip 
irrigation system efficiency is 90%.  
Solution:   
From Grimes and El -Zik (1990),            
𝑌𝑎=−3954 +1067 (𝐴𝑊 +7.5)0.5−54.14(𝐴𝑊 +7.5), kg/ha 
𝑃𝑟=$0.92×[−3954 +1067 (𝐴𝑊 +7.5)0.5−54.14(𝐴𝑊 +7.5)]−$0.0327 ×100 ×
𝐴𝑊, $/ha 
The m aximum profit is $925/ha, which is found at an applied depth of water 𝐴𝑊 𝑒= 79 cm  
 
  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:32)  
 
Example 59.2:  
Repeat Example 59.1 , but use the surface irrigation with 60 cm pre -irrigation and 60 % 
efficiency.  
Solution:  𝐴𝑊 =[𝐴𝑊 𝑒
[100 −(90−𝜂)]
100+60] 
Profit ,  𝑃𝑟     =$0.92/𝑘𝑔×[−3954 +1067 (𝐴𝑊 𝑒+7.5)0.5−54.14(𝐴𝑊 𝑒+7.5)]−𝑊𝐶 
Maximum profit ($623) is found at 𝐴𝑊 𝑒= 74 cm. The gross depth of water that is applied by 
the irrigation system is:  
 
Depth of water applied (AW)  =[𝐴𝑊 𝑒
[100 −(90−𝜂)]
100+60]=[74
1−0.3+60]=166 cm 
So, the annual benefit is decreased by approximately 300 dollars /ha. If you see th e profit  is 
$623 and in the case of drip irrigation  in the previous question the profit is $923 so, the 
difference  you get is around $ 300. And not only that, if you see the gross water depth also, 
increased  to 166 c m as compared to the previous example which is around 7 9cm. So, this way 
you can analyze if shifting from one irrigation into another irrigation is profitable or not  
(Refer Sl ide Time: 16:34)  
 
Environmental cost, previously we have only accounted for water cost, the environmental cost 
is also very important. Suppose in the case of surface irrigation there is a lot of runoff and that 
carries a lot of sediments from the field an d definitely , that pollutes the near water bodies. So, 
that involves the cost because you are dumping non-points source pollutants into the freshwater 
bodies.  So, if you consider that definitely , the profits will reduce. Erosion from the sloping 
furrow irr igation system is used here as an example, The s ediment (kg/ha)is computed with th e 
following  empirical equation  
𝑆𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  (𝑘𝑔
ℎ𝑎)=  103×(4.62×10−5𝑖3−7.84×10−3𝑖2+0.77𝑖−9.44) 
Where i is the seasonal gross depth of water applied by the irrigation  system in cm .  The graph 
shows the applied water depth on the x-axis and then sediment on the y-axis. So, increasing the 
water depth yields more sediment that runoff from the field to the nearest water bodies.   
The environmental cost (EnvC ) on a per hectar e basis is computed as dollar /ha and is given as  
𝐸𝑛𝑣𝐶  ($
ℎ𝑎)=$
𝑘𝑔×𝑘𝑔
ℎ𝑎 
So, the dollar per kg is the cost of sediment which is be ing added to the fresh water in kg/ha is 
the yield of sediment from the particular watershed or the irrigation system. The profit here is  
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡 , 𝑃𝑟= 𝑌𝑎×($
ℎ𝑎)−𝑊𝐶 −𝐸𝑛𝑣𝐶  
 𝑌𝑎 is the actual yield production, ($
ℎ𝑎) is the total income you get at the end of the season, then 
WC is a water cost and EnvC  is the environmental cost. So, the crop income minus water cost 
minus environmental cost will be  the profit.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:55)  
 
Example 59.3: Repeat Example 59.2 , but include the cost of erosion. The cost of erosion (land 
degradation and sediment remova l from river water) is $0.2/(kg/ha).  
Solution:  
The actual depth of applied water is used to calculate the amount of erosion.  
For example, the irrigation depth at AW e = 64 cm is  
𝑖= [𝐴𝑊 𝑒
1−(0.9−0.6)]+60 = [64
1−(0.3)]+60=151 cm 
𝑆𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  (𝑘𝑔
ℎ𝑎)
=  103
×(4.62×10−5×1513−7.84×10−3×1512+0.77×151 −9.44)
=429𝑘𝑔
ℎ𝑎 
𝐸𝑛𝑣𝐶  ($
ℎ𝑎)=0.2$
𝑘𝑔×429𝑘𝑔
ℎ𝑎=$86/ℎ𝑎 
Using the above profit equation, maximum profit ($519/ha) is found at AW e= 64 cm with I = 
151 cm. This example shows that the optimal economic depth of irrigation is generally reduced 
when the environmental cost of irrigation is considered.

The production functions defined  earlier  have  been experimented  for a particular region, if you 
want to translate that to a different region, or if someone wants to use the same production 
functions in another region ; FAO (Food and  Agriculture Organization ) has, given a procedure 
or linearized the actual p roduction function. So, that anybody can use the production function. 
So, here , for example, the applied depth of water on the x-axis and lint yield on the y-axis. The 
actual curve  for water production curve  is linearize d as shown above . So, how to transla te this 
particular curve into a linear curve? or linearization of this particular curve. So, two points were 
selected on the curve which form s a straight line that has a slope.  And,  ∆Y by ∆AW will be the 
slope of this particular line. And, knowing any point  on the curved  and knowing the slope you 
can find out the line equation. So, let us see  that.

𝑌𝑎= 𝑦𝑚𝑎𝑥 [1−%∆𝑌
%∆𝐴𝑊((𝐴𝑊 𝑟𝑒𝑞−𝐴𝑊 𝑒)
𝐴𝑊 𝑟𝑒𝑞)] 
Where ∆𝐴𝑊= change in applied water (percent or fraction);  ∆𝑌= Change in yield (percent or 
fraction); 𝑦𝑚𝑎𝑥 = yield with under no stress, kg/ha;  𝐴𝑊 𝑟𝑒𝑞= applied water depth with no yield 
reduction, cm

𝑌=𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 +∆𝑌
∆𝐴𝑊(𝐴𝑊 𝑒−𝐴𝑊 𝑟𝑒𝑞) 
or 
𝑌=𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 −∆𝑌
∆𝐴𝑊(𝐴𝑊 𝑟𝑒𝑞−𝐴𝑊 𝑒) 
=𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 [1−∆𝑌

Finally, you get the equation for linearized curve equation or equation of the line which is 
equivalent to the curve.

Example 59.4: Calculate cotton yield. The required depth of applied water in a region is 100 
cm, actual applied water depth is 80 cm, and the maximum yield is 1180 kg/ha.  
Solution:  𝐴𝑊 𝑒= 80 cm ;  𝑦𝑚𝑎𝑥= 1180 kg/ha;  𝐴𝑊 𝑟𝑒𝑞= 100 cm

Example 59.5: There is a 10 % yield loss due to pests, 10 % yield loss due to salinity , and the 
depth of applied water to sugar beets is 90 % of that required. The m aximu m sugar beet yield 
is 40 t/ha. What is the yield of sugar beets?  
Solution:  
Use the above procedure Example 59.4 for finding the yield and % reduction due  to water stress

Next is engineering economics  so whatever we have learned  in the previous slides is to estimate 
the economics or the profit for a particular season  and now you can see whether investing in 
such an irrigation project is profitable or not. Engineering economics analysis will help to 
decide whether to invest or not. So, it combines the present that is the capital investment and 
future benefits th at is the crop yield, a nd other benefits and costs  which involves  water cost, 
crop yield, energy cost , and labor costs, this  is the  cost-benefit ratio. So, this is very important 
as stated at the beginning of the lecture that there are two indicators: one is a net present value 
and then  the cost-benefit ratio.  
So, knowing the magnitude of these values definitely will help to decide  whether investing in 
a particular project is beneficial or not.  Such as  whether conversion to pressurize system will 
ultimately result in a greater p rofit or not. So, conversion to a pressure system may result in 
lower water cost and greater yield, but higher energy cost or capital cost. Because it has other 
components as well as a pump and all other components and that is not requir ed in the case of 
a surface irrigation system. So, this always tradeoff  between the yield as well as the costs.  
So, it does this by converting all future costs and benefits to the present value based on the time 
value of the money. For example , if you are putting some money into a particular  project and  
the benefits you are expecting for example,  in 10 years or 20 years  is 10,000 dollars . So, I 
calculate; the present value of the particular benefit and the present cost, so then the compare 
with the present cost and benefits. And finally, it says whether investing  in this particular 
project is worth it or not.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:34)  
 
The required rate of return is the terminolog y we use for the interest rate that a company expects 
to earn on investments. So, this interest rate is the required rate of returns. In engineering 
economic analysis, if a proposed project returns a profit at the required rate of return, even if 
the profit is only one dollar, then the decision is made to invest in the project.  So, this is the 
thumb rule or common sense that if you are getting a profit of one dollar you go and invest in 
the project. The future value (F) of money is calculated with the following formula;  
𝐹=𝑃 (1+𝑖)𝑛  
 Where   P is the present value and i is the interest rate, n is the number of years and F is the 
future  value.  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:35)  
 
Example 59. 6:  If $1.00 is placed into an account for 5 years at an interest rate of 6 %, then the 
value in 5 years is  
𝐹=𝑃 (1+𝑖)𝑛  
𝐹=$1.00× (1+0.06)5  
=$1.34 
On the other hand, money that is received in 5 years is not worth as much as it is today and 
should be discounted.  The present value of money received in the future is  
𝑃= 𝐹
(1+𝑖)𝑛 
In week 11 lecture number 4 we used discounting factor  so the same kind of concept we will 
be using in irrigation also. So, if you know the expect ed values in the future, you can also 
calculate  the value  in the present.  
(Refer Slide Time: 34:37)  
 
Example 59.7:  The expected annual income from a project is $500/yr  for 5 years, and the 
project requires a $2,000 investment. Determine whether or not to invest in the project at two 
required rates of return: 6 % and 8 %.  
Solution:  
The net present value at a 6 % required rate of return:  𝐹=𝑃 (1+𝑖)𝑛   or 
      𝑃= 𝐹
(1+𝑖)𝑛  
𝑃= 500
(1+0.06)1  + 500
(1+0.06)2 +500
(1+0.06)3 + ………+500
(1+0.06)5  
 
𝑃=472 +445 +419 +396 +373 =$2106 .1 
Net presence value = present value of five years expected income -investment  
Net presence value = 2106.1 -2000 =$106 .1 
Net presence value = $106 (>0; invest in the project)  
Investing 2000, you get 106.1 dollar s if you are goi ng with a 6 % interest rate. And since it is 
greater than 0 you have to invest in the project.  
(Refer Slide Time: 36:17)  
 
Similarly , you can estimate the present value of the worth of the benefits with a n 8 % interest 
rate. So, in the same formula , you get this is the present value of benefit at the first year, present 
value of the benefit of the second year, present value of income in  the third year. So, like there 
it goes.  
𝑃= 500
(1+0.08)1  + 500
(1+0.08)2 +500
(1+0.08)3 + ………+500
(1+0.08)5  
𝑃 = 463  + 429  + 397  + 367  + 340   
Net presence value = present value of five years expected income -investment  
Net presence value = 463 + 429  + 397  + 367  + 340 −2000   
𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒  =−$4 (<0; do not invest  @ 8%) 
So, the net present value is equal to the present value of 5 years expected income minus 
investment. So, that will be negative , in the sense you do not invest at 8 %. So, if you are 
investing at 6 % that is profitable , and do not invest at 8 %. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:08)  
 
The table above  gives the typical annual maintenance cost percentage for an irrigation system  
which will be useful while calculating the economics of the irrigation system.  
(Refer Slide Time: 37:25)  
 
Example 59.8  Determine  the present value of the income from alfalfa 6 years from now at a 
required rate of return of 7 %. (1) Assume no inflation. (2) Assume inflation of costs of 5 % 
per year and no inflation in the selling price of alfalfa. The present value of alfalfa produc tion 
is $631/acre -yr. Operating expenses are $321/acre -yr  
Solution:  
1. No inflation: first you consider the no inflations.  
Inflation in the sense, if you have a particular value of an asset that value will increase over the 
period of time;  
2. 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟  6 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡  =($631 −$321 )×1
(1+0.07)6=$207  
3.  Costs inflate at a rate of 5% a year  
𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠  𝑖𝑛 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟  6:$321 ×(1+0.05)6=$430 /𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒 P𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡  𝑖𝑛 𝑦𝑒𝑎𝑟  6:$631 −$430
=$201 /𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑒  
 The p resent value of year 6 profit (with inflation)  
=$201 (1
1+0.07)6
=$134  /acre 
 So, with inflation , you get 134 and without  inflation , you get 207 dollar s/ acre . 
(Refer Slide Time: 39:34)  
 
The c ash flow diagram indicates  the expected crop income and cost of a project  if you have 
invested in a part icular project and expecting the benefit after 10 years, 20 years. So, you have 
to bring the benefits to the present value and cost and then compare the cost-benefit analysis or 
the net present value. So, all these three indicators in the cash flow diagram  will be judging 
whether investing in a particular project, drainage , or irrigation project  is beneficial or not; 
with the particular interes t and over the period of time .  
This is all about irrigation economics.  So, in this lecture basically , we were looking into the 
economics of the whole irrigation project as well as the individual seasonal benefits. So, 
knowing the seasonal benefits by knowing the production cost, water cost , and then 
environmental cost; you will be estimating the profits o f that particular year. So, then with that 
profits and if you have invested in  a project  for 10 years; so every year you are expecting some  
benefits. And using a cash flow diagram or discounting analysis  as economic indicators you 
will be able to identify / judge whether investing in this particular project is worth or not.  Thank 
you.
