Centrifugal Pump : Power Requirement  
This is lecture  number 33 on the centrifugal pump 's power requ irement . As stated  in the 
previous lectures,  we will be focusing more on  Pump Power Requirement estimation .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 00:30)  
 
So here the total pumping head  is the total energy utilized  by the pump to  pump water 
from  low head to high head . There are two situations you can see , based on the location of 
the water source . If the water source  is above the centerline of the  pump and if the water 
source is below the centerline of the pump . 
The first image above present s the water source  above the cent ral line of  the pump and the 
second image is the case where the water source  is below  the centerline of the pump . In 
both cases , we are going to see what is the total head . If you remember the  power  equation , 
𝑃=𝑄×𝐻
76 
where Q is the discharge and H is the head .  
So, in both cases , we are going to see what is the head . Head involve s the head from  
pipeline s and then efficient  head losses  and other head losses . So, the main task is to find 
out, what is the to tal head here in both cases . 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:17)  
 
Let us see case number 1 where  the water source is below the centerline  of the pump . 
In the image you can see water source is below the centerline  of the pump , then it has a  
static suction  lift. Since the pump centerline  is below , so we use  the term lift , and if it is 
above  we use the term  head . 
So, in this case , the static  suction lift is the vertical distance  between the free surface of 
the water level to the centerline  of the pump . This we already  defined  in the previous 
lectures . Then total suction lift (Hs) will be  static suction lift (hss) and then the friction head 
losses in that pipe  (hfs). 
Total suction lift (H s) 
               Hs= h ss+ h fs 
 where, h fs= loss due to friction in suction pipe an d fittings, m  
So, we have two parts here, one is the  suction  part and then the discharge p art. So, in both 
cases , we going to  estimate  the head losses individual ly. So, in the suction case , we have 
two parts ; one is the suction lift and the friction  head l osses which are present in the  suction 
pipe, and also in addition to that , we have to consider  the bends  which  are present  and also  
the velocity head . If you see theoretically , moving water  from one place to another place 
in a pipe , there is a n elevation head, pressure head , and velocity head . So, the elevation  
head  is due to the height , the pressure head s is due to the f riction  and other things in the 
velocity head s so, these three heads we need to  consider here . So, the total suction lift will 
be, suction  lift plus and total static suction lift plus friction head . And then static discharge 
head  is the vertical distance  from the free discharge water level to the centerline  of the 
pump . 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:23) . 
 
The total discharge head  (Hd) 
Hd= h sd+hfd 
where, h fd= loss due to friction in delivery pipe and fittings, m  
Velocity head (Hv) 
Pressure required to create velocity of the flow in the pipe Hv  = v2/2g 
The t otal head will be the suction , discharge and velocity .  
Total head (H) : Hs + H d + H v 
H= (h ss+hfs) + (hsd+hfd) + (v2s/2g +V2d/2g) 
Now, similarly to the water source  which is above the centerline  of the pump also , we 
consider  both the suction case and the discharge case . In this case , it is the  static suction 
head because  it is above the center line, the vertical distance between , the top of the surface 
and the centerline of the pump . Then total suction head  will be  Hs= h ss - hfs 
 hfs is the friction head loss , and it is  negative because  we are not  going to use any energy 
to pump it due to gravity . The s tatic discharge head  is the same as before because we are 
not changing anything . Then, the total discharge  is the discharge head ; static discharge 
head and the f riction head loss and you have to use the velocity head . So, the total head in 
case of water  source abov e the centerline  of the pump  is equal to the static suction head , 
total discharge head , total suction head , and then  suction .  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:21)  
 
Once we know the total head and  the discharge  we can calculate  the water horsepower  
(WHP) . It is the  HP required  to pump  water from one place to another place .  
Water horse power (WHP) : It is theoretical power required for pumping  
WHP= DISCHARGE (lps)×TOTAL  HEAD ,   m
76 
= 𝐷𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐻𝐴𝑅𝐺𝐸  (𝑚3
𝑠)×TOTAL  HEAD ,   m
0.076 
Suppo se a motor  operates th e pump  to pump water , the shaft is connected between the 
pump and the motor , this point this is called shaft horsepower (SHP)  
Shaft horse power (SHP)  It is the power required at the power shaft  
SHP = WHP
PUMP  EFFICIENCY 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:55 ) 
 
Brake horsepower  (BHP) is equal to SHP divided by  the efficiency of the  drive. BHP is 
actual hp supplied by the engine for driving a pum p. In case  of mono block  pump ; BHP  = 
SHP.  
In the case of belt drive , BHP= 𝑊𝐻𝑃
ηd  where  ηd=drive efficiency .  
Then input horsepower  (IHP) , so this is where the  motor works .  
IHP=𝑊𝐻𝑃
ηd×ηp×ηm 
Where,  
𝜂𝑝= pump  efficiency   
𝜂𝑚=motor efficiency  
Kw input to electric motor=  BHP ×0.746
ηm 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:48)  
 
The above slide presents the overall power requirement in pumps.  (Q × H)/76 will give 
the WHP . Since pump and drive has an efficiency , so, at the shaft  point  SHP= WHP /np. 
BHP  = SHP,  in case of mono block ; otherwise  BHP =WHP/(n d×np). Then putting eng ine 
efficiency , also motor efficiency , you get IHP, IHP= BHP /nm. So, how to find out the  
motor efficiency ? If you see the  pump testing rig , basically the electrical energy which is 
supplied as voltage (V) into a current (I) that is P in and Pout will be estimated us ing the  
torque and angular velocity.   
Pin = V×I & Pout = T × ω =T × rpm × 2π x 60 
So, knowing Pout and Pin motor efficiency , 𝜂𝑚 = 𝑃𝑜𝑢𝑡/𝑃𝑖𝑛

Exercise 33.1:  
A pump lifts 100,000 liters of water per hour opera te at a total head of 20 m. Compute the 
WHP. If the pump has an efficiency of 75%, what size of the prime mover is required to 
operate the pump? If a direct driven electric motor with an efficiency of 80% is usual to 
operate the pump, compute the cost of electric  energy in units of 30 days. The pump is 
operated for 12 h daily for 30 days. The cost of electrical energy is ₹ 6 per unit  
Solution:  
WHP=DISCHARGE (lps)×TOTAL  HEAD ,m
76 = 100000 ×20
60×60×76 = 7.3  
SHP=WHP
PUMP  EFFICIENCY=7.30
0.75 = 9.73  
Since th e pump is direct driven, the SHP is the same as BHP  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:55)  
 
                                      Kw input to electric motor= BHP ×0.746
ηm 
= 9.73×0.746
0.8 
= 9.07 KW  
          Total energy consumption per month = 9.07×12×30  
= 3265 KWH  
Cost of electrical energy =3265×6             (1 unit= 1KWH)  
= ₹ 19,590  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:37)  
 
Exercise 33.2:  
A direct driven centrifugal pump coupled to a 3 -phase electric motor is installed in a deep 
open well. The discharge rate of the pump is 20 l ps. The pump efficiency is 70%. The 
centerline  of the pump is 60 cm vertical above the static water level and 6 m above the 
pumping water level. The suction pipe is 7.5 m long and 8 cm in diameter. A foot valve 
with strainers is attached to the bottom of the  suction pipe. The suction line i s connected 
to the pump inlet by a long sweep bend of the same size as the suction pipe. The pump 
discharges water into the top of the pump stand of an underground pipeline water 
distribution system. The vertical distance betwe en the top of the stand and the centerline  
of the pump is 20 m. The total length of the 7 cm diameter discharge is 20m . The pipe 
fittings on the discharge side are three long sweep bends, one gate valve , and one reflux 
valve, all of which are of the same size  as the discharge pipe.  
From the above data, compute  
1) Total head  
2) Water horse power  
3)  Brake horse power of the motor required to drive the pump  
  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:12)  
 
So, let us see here , the whole thing can be  put in this manner  as shown in the slide  above.  
So in between the pump  and the suction line , there is a sweep  bend and at the end  of the 
suction , there is a  foot valve . There is a reflux valve, two  sweep bend s, and a gate valve in  
between the delivery and the pump . So, this way you can schematic the whole  thing  then 
calculat e. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:45) . 
 
Solution :  
Area of suction pipe  a 1= 𝜋×8×8
4×100 ×100   = 0.005 m2 
Velocity of water in suction pipe  v 1 = 𝑄
𝑎1 = 20
 1000 ×0.005 = 4 m/s  
Area of discharge pipe, a 2 = 0.0038m2 
Velocity of water in the discharge pipe v 2 = 5.26 m/s  
i. Total head = total  suction lift + total discharge head  
static suction lift = 6m  
Head loss in suction pipe of 8 cm dia and 7.5 m length  = 2.25 (from friction loss table)  
Head loss in long sweep bend  8cm dia = 0.41 m  
Head loss in strainer = K s𝑣2
2𝑔 = 0.95×4×4
2×9.81=0.77 m  
 (Refer Slide Time: 20:42) . 
 
So, here there is a  friction head loss table , knowing the  discharge and the corresponding 
diameter , you can find out the friction head loss for 100 m length and then you can reduce 
it to your length . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:01)  
 
Similarly , for walls for long sweep bend  for example; for a pipe size find out the equivalent 
pipe length and then go back to the f riction table and find out the  corresponding h f for this 
particular  length . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:18)  
 
Head loss in foot valve = K f 𝑣2
2𝑔=0.8×4×4
2×9.81=0.65 m 
Velocity head (suction line)= 𝑣2
2𝑔 = 4×4
2×9.81 = 0.81 m  
Total suction lift = 6 + 2.25 +0.77+ 0.65 + 0.81 + 0.41 =10.89 m  
Static discharge head = 20 m  
Head loss in discharge pipe of 7cm dia and 20m length = 72×20
100 =14.4 m  
Head loss in three long sweep bends, 7cm dia = 2.07 m  
Head loss in gate valve of 7cm dia = 0.33 m  
Head loss in reflux valve (based on foot valve and discharge velocity)=1.12 m  
Velocity head (discharge line)= 1.40 m  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:58) . 
 
Total discharge head =20+14.40+2.07+0.33+1.112+1.40 = 39.32 m  
Total head = 10.89 + 39.32  
= 50.21 m  
ii. Water horse power = 20×50.21
76 
= 13.21 hP  
Brake horse power of the motor required to drive the pump = 13.21
70×100  
=18.87 hP  
So in this lecture , we covered  the install ation of  a centrifugal pump in two cases ; case 1 
when  the water source is below the centerline  of the p ump. You can estimate the total head 
loss the head loss will have t wo parts  the suction  lift and discharge  head  so, these two 
heads we need to c onsider for  finding out the total he ad. In each part  either  suction or 
discharge , it has a pressure head , friction head , velocity head . The first thing is the pipe line 
length that will give the elevation head  and then the friction head los s either  due to the 
pipe and then the velocity  head  due to the turbulence  and other things . 
In addition to that , if you have bends , you have to consider the friction head loss due to 
bends  and similarly in the case of discharge side. So, combining all heads will give the 
total head . So, knowing  the total head , multiplying with the discharge divided by 76 will 
give the water horse power . So that means, for water to  displa ce from suction to discharge 
level , you need to operate the pump  at a particular  hp. Then again the power  will be 
different from  the end of the pump,  starting of the pump to the motor  level based on the  
efficiency of the devices . 
Then based on that you  have WHP at the starting of the pump  and then  SHP, combining 
with the pump efficiency the n BHP.  And then  IHP is equal to BHP/n m. So, at different 
stages the efficiencies  are different . We solve the two examples here; the first example , on 
the power requirement , and the second  example is finding out the  total head  for case 
number 1 where  the water source  is above the centerline . Similarly,  you can find out  for 
case number 2: the water s ource is below  the centerline . In the next class , we will be 
focusing on  cavitation in  a centrifugal pump , pump characteristic curves , affinity laws` 
and then  there are other an d pumps  we need to discuss . 
Thank you  so much .
