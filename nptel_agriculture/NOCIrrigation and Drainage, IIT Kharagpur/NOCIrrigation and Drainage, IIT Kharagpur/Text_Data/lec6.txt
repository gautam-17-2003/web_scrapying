Lecture – 06 
Field Water Balance  
 
Friends , welcome to lecture number  6 of Irrigation and Drainage , lecture se ries. In the 
previous lectures , we were talking about soil  water , soil water  relationships , soil moisture 
content and soil  suction  and also how to measure soil moisture and soil moisture tension  
or soil moisture suction . 
In this lecture we are going to tal k about field water balance , once we know  how to 
measur e soil water , soil moisture tension , within the soil then  we need to see  what are all 
the inputs and outputs of the field and what would be the s torage  or the soil water r eservoir  
within this soil system. So, we are going to study the water balance components and also 
work on some of the p roblems . 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:40 ) 
 
In the picture above you can see, the surface  and subsurface  layer , and the re are inputs 
(water inputs ) as irrigation  or rain fall or both,  and then there is a capillary rise from the 
water table to the root zone . And then the output s are the runoff , evapotranspiration  (if you 
have crop on top of the soil then water is l ost through  evapotranspiration ) and then below 
the root zone  there is deep percolation loss where  water can pass through the deep  root 
zone  as deep percolation  and then if you have water  table  lying below  the root zone then 
 
 there is a capillary rise from the  water table to the root zone . So, these are the major 
compone nts we are dealing with in  water balance at field level . So, the whole water balance  
equation is as follows .  
 
Where SW i is the soil water  i indicates  in the beginning  which means soil water in the 
beginning ; P is the Precipitation ; I is the irrigation ; UW is the capillary rise , SW f;  is the  
final soil water  (suppose we are  balancing daily  so, the soil water at the end of the day );  
Rs is the runoff   loss; D is the deep percolation loss and ET  evapotranspiration loss or E is 
the evaporation  in case  you do  not have crop . So, these are the  major components of the 
water balance . The difference between  SW i and SW f is the soil  water storage,  that is the 
inputs minus  outputs  will give the storage . 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:29)  
 
From agricultural point of view , the same equation can be  used. 
 
Where, ∆S this is a difference  between the soil moisture in the previous day and the soil 
moisture in the current day. ∆V gives  the amount of water  which is  present in the plant s, 
since this is less than 1 percent as compared to  ∆S, we can neglect this in field w ater 
balance . And the equation become s 
 
  
D is having both positive and negative  sign + D is considered when water is added from 
the cap illary rise and – D is considered  when there is a loss, through  deep percolation . If 
you want to find out the rate of cha nge in moisture storage the above equation  is 
differentiated with respect to time and it is given as follows  
 
Where p is change in p recipitation ; i is change in i rrigation ; d is change in capillary rise or 
deep percolation ; rs is change in r unoff  and et is change in evapotranspiration or 
evaporation.  So, this will give the change in soil moisture storage.   
The picture  above  represents the root zone  with other  water balance components like , 
irrigation , rainfall as input  and evaporation, transpiration , runoff or seepage a s loss or 
output . For example, in rice crop there is ponded water if the water  is leaving  the root zone , 
then is called  deep percolation and the water from root zone will go into the groundwater 
as groundwater recharge.  But t he unsaturated p ortion above the water table  will 
experienced capillary rise to some extent.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:17)  
 
Next is how to measure or how to estimate  these water or field water balance components?  
So, for example, for measuring  precipitation  or rainfall  (precipitation is more general term 
 
 rainfall is a specific because  it is mostly in liquid form , precipitation could be  liquid form 
or sno w or hails or drizzle  so, all this  are comm on form of  precipitation ). Generally,  for 
measuring rainfall  we use a  rain gauges , it could be a  Symons rain gauge which is a non-
recording  type. In this  rain gauge there is a funnel and a cylinder; the  water which falls 
through the funnel will be collected in a cylinder and measured ; it will give the cumulative  
amount of rainfall duri ng the storm even t. And then th ere is a float type rain  gauge  which  
is similar to the Symons gauge, there is a funnel and a cylinder but the cylinder has a float 
connected to  a pen which is mounted on a  drum . The drum has  a graph sheet  and the drum 
rotates  according to the clock ; so, based on the water input to the system , the pen responds  
accordingly ; this rain gauge is a recording type . 
And, there is a  tipping bucket rain gauge this  is also is a recording type. So, here water 
will be co llected to the funnel and there are the two buckets  inside the funnel , the bucket 
which is on top will be filled first , once it is filled it goes down because of the weight  and 
it brings the other bucket up  similarly water will fill the second bucket and it will go down 
and simultaneously it will bring the first bucket up . The buckets are calibrated  for a certain 
volume of water and the number of tips will give the total amount of  water , so, it will give  
either rate or cumulative  rainfall . And, then there are simple rain gaug es called  farm rain 
gauges , it consists  of a simple tube and a funnel , and this is pre -calibrated  and there is a 
red float so you can easily see the  water surface . This is very simple  and a farmer  can 
manage or maintained , within the field . The depth of wa ter will be converted into the 
rainfall depth . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:50 ) 
 
 
 Next is  how to measure the irrigation water . So, irrigation water in the first image above  
is measured using  a flow meter . The flow meter could  be analogue or the digital  type, it  is 
very easy method , it work s on the principle of area and velocity  method  and that will give 
the number of rotations  and t he number of rotations  will turn the needle .  The next picture  
is when  I was in U C Davis working on the field s with my colleague Denn is. So, we were 
using bucket and stopwatch to find  out the inflow to each furrow . So, at a particular  time 
we start collecting water  for a fixed time  interval like 10 or 15 mins and then we measure  
the volume of  water in the bucket using the measuring cyli nder so, this wil l give the flow 
rate at that particular moment . This measurement is conduct at  the head end; at the tail end 
you can  measure the runoff using flumes . The 3rd picture above shows a Parshall flume 
and based on the depth , you can convert it into flow rate . So, this way you can measure 
the flow rate  at the  field head end as well as the tail end . 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:57 ) 
 
Infiltration is very important as far as irrigation is concerned . Basically infiltration  is when 
the water  enters into the soil so, the process by which water enters into the soil from the 
ground surface  is infiltration . Mainly gravity , suction and capillarity are the three forces 
by which water enters into the  surface . Generally,  we say the infiltration is down ward 
moment , but if we are  truly speaking the infiltration is a three dimensional process ; so, it 
goes downwards , then it goes horizontal , and radial ly you can say  horizontal , vertical  and 
also radial conducti ng. So, that is why infiltration process is a  3D process , and mainly a  
three forces  govern  as ment ioned.  
 
 The factors affecting infiltration  are the a) soil and land factors , for example, fine soil 
versus co arse soil, infiltration will be  faster  in coarse soil  while  in the fine soil infiltration 
will be  slower . In land factors , suppose  if you have lot of liter on the surface , then runoff 
will be slower , infiltration  will not be faster , but the opportunity to infiltrate with  be more  
compare to bare ground . 
b) Flow conditions  like turbulent flow or laminar flow conditio ns: laminar flow is gentle  
flow and henc e more  opportunity to infiltrate as comp ared to turbulent  flow which is very 
fast and it  can also erode the topsoil , erosion seal the pores  and stops the infiltration 
some times.  
c) Fluid factors  like viscosity  also a ffects infiltration , when the  viscosity is low then  
infiltration  will be faster . Temperature is a major factor influencing  viscosity . 
d)Management practices : For example,  comparing  rice soils where puddling is done  and 
the other crops  without puddling , since the soil is under puddle  condition , the infiltration 
rate will be  slower  in rice soils  compared to other  crops  soils, water could stay on  rice soils 
for 4  to 5 days, because of puddling.  
In the infiltration process , initially the water enters  the soil , through  these forces ; gravity 
suction and capillarity . The first thing is soil particles adsorbs water  thereafter once  water 
is adsorb . The adsorption  is going to increase  till saturat ion then you get gravity  flow, and 
then the wetting  front  starts from to p to bottom . 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:27)  
 
 
 The picture  above  shows all the infiltration process . Assume that  you put some water on 
top of the surface  then after 1 hour of infiltration if you take a cross section of the soil ; the 
first few milli meter s of the s oil are saturated because just on top of this zone there is 
ponded  water , this zone  is called the saturation  zone.  Immediately below that  ponded 
surface there is a saturation  zone which is  followed by a transition zone , in the transition 
zone  there is a  rapid decrease of water content with depth . The other picture above shows 
the water content at different  depth . The initial water content before  applying water is 
assume d to be uniform because  it is saturated at the saturation point , at the transi tion zone 
you could see there is a decline  in moistur e content with depth . Then after that  there is a 
slow decrease in w ater content  which is called  the transmission zone , if you collect  the soil 
sample  in this zone , and analyze  it the soil water content is almost same. Then,  next is the 
wetting  zone  with a wetting front, wetting zone  in between transmission  zone  and wetting 
front; after  the wetting front is  the dry soil , or soil with the initial moisture content . A 
decrease in soil moisture  is clearly seen , and that is going to  connect to your  initial moisture 
content . So wetting  front moves  slowly  based on the  water input , the moment you r stop 
water  the wetting front  moves  further and  then stop. 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:28 ) 
 
Some  infiltration terminologie s are Infiltration rate(mm/h) which  is the  rate at which a 
particular s oil is able to absorb  either  rainfall or irrigation  or absorb water . So, the rate at 
which the soil absorb s water  is called infiltration rate . It is related to  saturated hydraulic  
conductivity of the near  surface soil s. So, once you have infiltration rate at different time 
 
 interval and you can find out the infiltration dep th during that  time interval , and if you can 
accumulate  or sum up all the dep ths, you will get the cumulative infi ltrations  during the 
period . Infiltration capacity is  the maximum rate at which water can enter to a soil for a 
given condition , it is also  measured in  mm/h. When the infiltration capacity decline  rapidly  
during the  early part  of storm  and then tends to a constant value  it is referred to as basic 
infiltration rate . So, initially the infiltration rate would be very high , then after that 
infilt ration rate is going to decline  and then come to a constant . So, this constant  value is 
what we call basic infiltrat ion rate. 
 For example, when you are thirsty,  initially you  can intake large amount of water , then 
after that you r intake capacity is  going to decrease , then after sometime  you no longer 
required  to drink  any water and the intake in your case is  going to  be 0, but soil is a porous  
media and  it is infinitesimally  deep , then you may expect  the water to still penetrate or still 
infiltrate down and  that is  why you get a constant infiltration rate here. 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:28)  
 
How to measure  infiltration ? So, for measuring  infiltration you have  single ring 
infiltrometer s and also double ring infiltrometer s. Figure above shows the infiltrometers 
which are a cylinders  made up of in stainless steel with top and bottom  open . The single 
ring infiltromet er is of 30 cm diameter and 45 cm height and  for measuring infiltration  we 
leave 30 cm on  top of the soil and 15 cm is inserted below the ground .  Initial we  fill the 
ring with  water  up to a particular level or till the top of the ring  and then the timing  is 
 
 noted,  a scale  is used  for measur ing the water level . Then for a particular fall we are going 
to note the time; then we have to refill back  the declined level of water  and again start 
counting  the time . And we have to stop th e experiment when the fall is constant , for a 
particular times  or when the rate is constant .  
The problem with single ring infiltrometer measurement  is because  there is a possibility 
that water can  move laterally,  we are expecting water to go vertically down . But since it is 
a single ring water can go horizon tally; in order to stop the lateral  flow,  we use the double 
ring  infiltrometer . The outer ring will control the  lateral  flow of water and we are  ensuring 
that water  penetrates down vertically . The inner ring is 30 cm diameter  and the outer ring 
is 60 cm diameter . And similarly , as in case of single ring the inner ring is 15 cm  below 
the ground and 30 cm above the ground ; while the outer ring is 50 cm above ground and 
10 cm below the ground;  and here also we use the  scale to measure the water depth . 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:22)  
 
The above table shows the measurements  made during an experiment in  a double ring 
infiltrometer experiment at IIT Kharagpur . Column 2 shows the different times the water 
level is measured , the elapsed time (column 3 ) and time interval  of 5, 10 15, 30 and 60  
mins  (column 4).  So, initially the water level is at  28 cm, we refill the ring after observing 
the level to drop at  around  2 cm down  as shown in column 5 . Then, you have to find out 
the d rop in water level (column 6) and add it simultaneously to obtained the cumulative 
 
 infiltration . The infiltration  rate (column 9) is obtained by dividing the 6th column  by the 
4th column . 
(Refer Slide Time: 29:16)  
  
Once you have the readings with you can draw , the  infiltration characteristic curves  
(graphs) with  time on  x-axis and infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration  on y-axis. The 
cumulative infiltration  increases with time as shown in graph where as the infiltration rate 
initial ly will be h igher , then rapidly decline up to a constant value and  you can clearly see 
the basic infiltration rate  is almost constant  which is about  10.7 mm/h in our case . The 
Table above shows the steady infiltration rate or basic infiltration rate  for sandy soil , sandy 
loam soi l, loamy soil , silt loam , clayey soil (obtain from other sources ). 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:16)  
 
  
Next is  how to estimate the infiltration using  some available empirical or physically bas e 
models .  The a bove table shows the  Green -Ampt  equation ;  
𝑓=𝐾+ 𝜂𝑆𝑐𝐾
𝐹 
Where f is the infiltration rate ; K is Green -Ampt  constant ; ƞ is called  porosity  which is 
constant , and F is the cumulative infiltration and Sc is the capillary  suction of the wetting 
front  or suction head.  
Philip two -term equation is as follo ws 
F = St 0.5 + At 
𝑓 = 1
2𝑆𝑡 −0.5 + 𝐴  
Where S  is the sorptivity , (sorptivity is the capacity of soil to absorb water ). Philips two -
term equation for  cumulative infiltration was differentiated  to get th e equation for 
infiltration rate.  
Similarly , Kost iakov equation  is a very simple empirical equation given as follows  
f = a × t-b 
and by integrating  the infiltration rate equation  we get th e equation  for cumulative  
infiltration .  
 
 F = 𝑎
1−𝑏 𝑡1−𝑏 
Where a and b are the constant.  
The other model is th e Horton model  and it is  the based on the infiltration behavior  or 
nature of the curve . It given as follows   
f = f c + (f 0 - fc) exp( -kt) 
fc is the basic infiltration rate and f 0 is the  initial infiltration rate; k is a constant   
 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:17 ) 
 
Let us solve an  example  
Determine the parameters for Kostiakov’s equ ation from the data of table  obtained during 
a double ring infiltrometer test conducted in a plot at IIT Kharagpur and test the model for 
the data  
Solution:  
So, here the first thing wh at you have to do is convert th e Kostiakov to logarithmic  form.   
𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑓 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑎 − 𝑏 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑡 
𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝐹 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑎
1−𝑏) +(1−𝑏) 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑡 
 
 So, once  you get this equation  for infiltration rate and cumulative  infiltration . A plot of 
infiltration  rate vs. time is drawn on a log - log paper (Fig a) and similarly for cumulative 
infiltration (Fig b)  
   
So, now determine the parameters for Kostiakov’s equation from the equation devel oped 
from the graph of the data. So, with this you can find out  log f value and log  a value and 
log b value  and you can estimate what is a and  what is b . So, the data is  given ; you fi t the 
data into a  logarithmic  scale and you get you get the  coefficien ts. 
Parameters  a b 
Infiltration Rate  2.864  0.487  
Cumulative Infiltration  3.9569  0.5547  
(Refer Slide Time: 34:02 ) 
 
Once you have the parameters estimate  the infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration 
using the  parameters estimated  with the data fit ting. The graph obtained is as shown  above. 
(Refer Slide Time: 34:33)  
b  
  
You can also use the infiltration data to find out  Green -Ampt  parameters like K and wetting 
front suction head .  
Determine the Green -Ampt infiltration model parameters (K and 𝜑) for the following r ing 
infiltration data (Tables a and b) obtained at an experimental site of AgFE department, IIT 
Kharagpur.  The tricky part here is  you have to do the experiment  two times 
Table a: Infiltration data for ponding 
depth of 6 cm               Table b: Infiltration data for ponding 
depth of 12 cm              
Time (min)  F (cm)  Observed, f 
(cm/min)   
Time (min)  F (cm)  Observed, f 
(cm/min)  
0 0   0 0  
10 0.2 0.020   5 0.2 0.040  
20 0.4 0.020   15 0.4 0.027  
30 0.6 0.020   30 0.6 0.020  
40 0.7 0.018  45 0.8 0.018  
50 0.8 0.016   
So, Table a gives the  ring infiltrometer  data with 6 centimeter  ponding dep th and Table b 
for 12 centimeter ponding depth , with the time and  cumulative and infiltration

The Green -Ampt  equation   
𝑓=𝐾+
∆𝜃
𝐻+𝜑𝐾𝐹  
We know  
∆𝜃=𝜃𝑠−𝜃𝑖 
𝜃𝑠 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜃𝑖 are the  saturated  soil moisture and the initial soil moisture  respectively , and H 
is the  ponding depth  and φ is wetting front suction head  and K is Green -Ampt  parameter 
or some  researches also use  hydraulic conductivity . The interesting part is  that this 
equation did not contain t term  compared to other equations ; that i s why this equation is 
called autonomous equation . So, the solution is  difficult  in other case you may you get the 
solution analytically , but here you get the numerical solution  
                                                         𝑓=𝐴+𝐵
𝐹 
Where 𝐴=𝐾 and 𝐵=∆𝜃(𝐻+𝜑)𝐾 The above is a straight line equation  and A is  the 
intercept and B is the slope . So, you have  capital F, you have small f  and find out  what is 
1 by F, then once this is final, you have the K and φ parameter s you can estimate  the 
infiltration rate and compare  observed and simulated . Similarly, for 12 cm we can  have f 
and 1 by F; so, small f and 1 by F, 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 38:12)  
 
Once you have these readings  next part is  drawing the graphs . So, you draw the  graph here 
1/F versus f. Then  you have a straight line and a straight line equation . Similarly, for  the 
12 cm ponding depth , you get another  regression equation. So , you have two equations  
now, and  also two unknowns,  So, from this equation you get the parameters   
Parameter  6 cm ponding depth  12 cm ponding depth  
K 0.017  0.0107  
∆𝜃(𝐻+𝜑)𝐾 0.0007  0.0059  
The K values are  very close in  both cases and once you have the K value  the unknown 
terms  can be solve . If we have  ∆θ data,  you can you can easily get the φ. So, if you do  not 
have the y data then θs also need to be estimated  and you may have to  go for  another set of 
data; so, three  unknowns , three datasets , then you can find out  φ easily,  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 40:24)  
 
So, For 6 cm ponding depth  
𝑓=0.017 + 0.0007
𝐹 
∆𝜃(𝐻+𝜑)𝐾 = 0.0007  
∆𝜃 (6+𝜑)=0.0007
0.017 
                                             ∆𝜃 (6+𝜑)= 0.041                  1                
For 12 cm ponding depth  
𝑓=0.0107 + 0.0059
𝐹 
∆𝜃(𝐻+𝜑)𝐾 = 0.0059  
∆𝜃 (12+𝜑)=0.0059
0.0107 
                                              ∆𝜃 (12+𝜑)= 0.55                                            2 
From Eqs. 1 and 2,  
𝜑 = - 0.468 cm  
Hence wetting front suction head is -0.468 cm . 
So, the advantage  with ring infiltrometer data  is that  you can  estimate  Green -Ampt  
infiltration parameters  like K and wetting front suction head  and also θs. 
 
 In this lecture what  our focus was  the field water balance, which  contains inputs and 
outputs . The inputs are rainfall and irrigation  and t he outputs are  runoff, 
evapotranspiration , deep percolation, then  when you subtract  the output from the  input s 
then can you get the change in moisture content,  And then we started digging how to 
measure  the precipitation  and rainfall in our case and then how to measur e infiltration , 
then now how to estimate infiltration , using Green -Ampt  infiltration  parameters  and 
Kostiakov  infiltration  parameters . In the next lecture , we a re going to talk about the 
evapotranspiration  which  is another component of this water balance .  
Thank you  so much .
