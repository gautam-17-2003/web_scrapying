Surface Irrigation Hydraulics  
In this lecture 17, we going to talk about  Surface  Irrigation H ydraulics , we will focus on  
the phases of irrigation and  how do we model those phases , and what is the meaning of 
those phases , while  simulating  water flow in surface irrigation .  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:54)  
 
The aim of  surface  irrigation system is  to determin e the appropriate inflow rates , and cutoff 
times  or when to stop irrigation so that the maximum or desired  performance is obtain ed 
for a given field condition . In order to do that  some of the parameters we need to focus  are 
stream size -how much water we ne ed to release , and then the next one is the rate of 
advance . The third is the length of run off, the fourth one is the flow depth , fifth is int ake 
rate, sixth is the land slope , seventh is the roughness , eighth  is the  erosion hazard  - so 
whether the flow is causing any  erosion  or not and the ninth  is the  shape of flow or border  
furrow - these are  the shapes and depth of wate r to be applied . So these  are the parameters 
we need to con sider  while designing  an irrigation  system . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:40)  
 
Next i s the irrigation phases , basically the re are four  phases  - Advance phase, Storage 
Phase, Depletion Phase and Recession Phase . The advance phase b egins when  water is 
turned into the field and e nds when water reaches the downstream end of the field. So, 
what  we do in  surface irrigation system ? So, assume a  field and  at one end you are going 
to deliver water and we expect that  water  to reach the field end point . The water which is 
travelling from  head end to tail end is called the advance phase  and the  water m oves very 
slowly from point to point and reaches the tail end. Then if you draw a graph between 
distance and the time  we expect a curve  called advance curve  as shown in the graph above.  
Suppose  the field is an imperious  surface so, water will not infiltrat e. So, in that case you 
may expect a straight  line instead of  a curvy  line because there is no loss of water  and is 
flowing at the same speed . But since  the field is not impervious water is flowing through 
porous surface  so, at the end the travel  time will  be delayed forming  to the curve above . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:34)  
 
So from head end to tail end  we expect the advance water front , then after that  we expect  
the infiltration , suppose  there is a plant with a particular root zone , when the water front 
advan ce reaches from one end to other  end but is not enough to infiltrate  down to the root 
zone,  we need to irrigate mor e. So you are still irrigating  when  the water  is reaching the 
end i.e., called  the run off phase or storage phase then once the  wetting front  reaches the 
desired  level , then we are going to turn off the pump . Since there is no water after turning 
off the pump,  from the point of cut off to no water , this phase is called the depletion phase . 
Similar to advance point , so the drying phase is going to start and the drying point is going 
to advance from head end to tail end and i.e., called recession  phase. These  are the four 
phases we expect in surface irrigation system and  it is best  represented as the graph  above . 
Refer Slide Time: 06:31)  
 
From  the advance curve there is a time of advance then after that you cut o ff water at cutoff 
time ( Tco) but still there is a storage water and in order to infiltrate  down, this takes time. 
Tco to T d is the  depletion  phase , then after that the  drying  phase is going to start  i.e., called 
recession phase  and it’s going to end  at T r.  
The difference between these  two curves  i.e., the advance curve and the recessio n curve  is 
called infiltration  opportunity  time. So at that particular  time since  advance point to the 
recession point the soil got opportunity to infiltrate  water down to the desired point . These 
are the irrigation hydraulics we need to  concentrate in order to simulate the water flow in 
irrigation system .  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:12)  
 
Typical surface irrigati on phases as  explained  earlier can be  clearly see n in the picture s 
above. T he first phase is advance phase , and it begins when water is turned into the field , 
and when the water initially enters  the field  the phase starts and then the water front 
advances  to the field end ; and it ends when the  water reaches the downstream o f the field . 
Storage phase begins when advance phase ends  and t he storage phase ends when the inflow 
ends, i.e., when you cut off  the water supply. T he depletion phase  begins when storage  
phase ends  which happen  immedia tely after cut off  and it ends when the depth of the water 
at the  head end is going to de plete from h to 0. The re cession  phase begins  when depletion 
phase ends and then it continues until drying front reaches the end just like a reverse of 
advance  curve, it is a kind of a  reverse advance .  
(Refer Slide Time: 09:54)  
 
So, the difference  between the advance time and recession time  is the infiltration 
opportunity time  i.e., the vertical distance  between the advance and recessio n curves . For 
irrigation  uniformity to be high , opportunity  time must be same throughout the field . And 
this is normally  facilitated by flat advance curve .  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:48)  
 
Next is the governing  equations , if you are talking about the simulatio n model basically , 
the simulation models  in surface irrigation  works or  is formulated on  Saint -Venant ’s 
equations . The equation  has both mass and momentum equations,  as follows:  
𝜕𝑄
𝜕𝑥+𝜕𝐴
𝜕𝑡+𝐼=0 
(1
𝑔)(𝜕𝑉
𝜕𝑡)+(𝑉
𝑔)(𝜕𝑉
𝜕𝑡)+(𝜕𝑦
𝜕𝑥)=𝑆0−𝑆𝑓+𝑉𝐼
2𝑔𝐴 
Where , y - Depth of flow (m) ; t -Time from beginning of irrigation (s) ; V - Velocity of 
flow as f (x, t) (m/s) ; x - Distance along the furrow  length (m) ; I - Infiltration  rate as f (x, 
t) (m/s) ;  g - Acceleration due to gravity (m/s2); S0 - Longitudinal slope of furrow (m/m) ; 
Sf - Slope of energy grade line (friction slope) in m/m ; A - Cross -sectional area as f (x, t) 
(m2) . 
Clearly you see this  is the  conservation of mass and conservation of momentum  equation  
The complete  Saint -Venant equation is called  the full hydrodynamic  model  without 
simplifying the  equations . The depth  y this is very important because  we are going to 
simulate the depth ove r the surface of  the field . And we have different modelling 
approaches  for simulation , based on the different simplifications  of the above equation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:23)  
 
So, here there are  4 approaches  as explained in the table , the first one is ful l hydro dynamic 
model , which uses this  Saint -Venant ’s equations for conservation mass and momentum 
equations ; and then the zero inertia equations where the momentum equation is simplified  
and it uses the mass equation and  the zero inertia term will be negl ected here .𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑥=𝑆𝑜−
𝑆𝑓, these two equations will be used to solve  for depth .  
And third one is kinematic wave equation , this is uniform flow  assumption i.e., 𝑆𝑜−𝑆𝑓=
0 for both the back slope and  energy slope . In that case here we h ave a mass equation  and 
then 𝑆𝑜−𝑆𝑓=0, these two equation will be used for solving  for depth . Fourth o ne is the 
simplified  equation  i.e., a volume balance equation , this is a numerical solution 
temporarily and spatially lumped to mass conservation  equation . So, in this the complete 
momentum equation will be neglected and only  mass equation will be left . So, we are 
going to  solve the mass equation  in the following slides . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:15)  
 
So, here is the mentioned volume balance model , other models can be  adopted from  other 
research articles  or in any other books  I mentioned  in earlier  lectures , but here we  stick to  
the volume balance model , which is  simplified  mass balance equation . So, if you look at 
the olume balance  equation : 
𝑄𝑜𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+∫𝑍(𝑡−𝑡𝑠)𝑥
0𝑑𝑠                           (1) 
Where,  𝑄𝑜= inflow rate(m3/min); t = time from the start of inflow (min); 𝐴0 = Wetted area 
at the head end (m2); 𝜎𝑦 = Surface profile shape factor (0.77); x = wat er front advance (m); 
Z = cumulative infiltration per unit length (m3/m); 𝑡𝑠=time required to reach water front at 
a distance of s (m).  
Suppose in a field  the water which is  added is  Q0 × t, this whole volume  will be 
converted /break down in to two parts, one is surface volume and subsurface volume . Water 
which is staying on top and  volume which is infiltrated  down these  two parts can be 
thought of two rectangular pieces , and if we sum these  two it will be equal to  Q0 × t. But 
the actual  piece of volume  need s to be multipl ied with the fraction  𝜎𝑦 and A0. If you have 
a whole rectangular piece , in real term we expect an irregular  surface shape and thi s needs 
to be adjusted  and i.e., the reason 𝜎𝑦 is called surface  shape factor . And the same thing we 
converted the second part and the whole  thing is  calculated by a by an integral  0 to x, Z is 
the vertical water front and  𝑡−𝑡𝑠 is the infiltration  opportunity time.  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:31)  
 
The total volume applied will be equal to the surface storage an d sub-surface  storage . 𝜎𝑦 
is shape factor that will be taken as 0.77 and A0 will be estimated by using Manning’s 
equation  after considering, 𝐴2𝑅43⁄=𝜌1𝐴𝜌2: 
𝐴0=[𝑄02𝑛2
3600 𝜌1𝑆0]1/𝜌2
       (2) 
Where,  n= Manning’s roughness coefficient; 𝑆0 = Field slope ( 𝑆0>0)  and  𝜌1,  ρ2 = Furrow 
shape parameter (Walker and Skogerboe 1987). Since  𝑆0>0, the proposed method is 
applicable and 3600  is for a unit conversion  when you convert  m3/h to m3/s .  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:10)  
 
The next one is  the cumulative infiltration  Z estimated using the  Kostiakov equation :  
       𝑍(𝜏)=𝑘𝜏𝑎+𝑓0𝜏                           (3) 
Where, K (m2/mina) and a( -) = fitted  parameters; 𝜏 (=𝑡−𝑡𝑠)= infiltration opportunity 
time (min); and 𝑓0 = basic infiltration rate (m2/min)  
Generally,  what we assume f 0 is known before  the irrigation event , otherwise  we can also  
estimate by inflow outflow method or there are some  values given by walker and  
Skogerboe . 
Substitute Eq (3) in Eq (1)  
         𝑄0𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+∫[𝑘(𝑡−𝑡𝑠)𝑎+𝑓0(𝑡−𝑡𝑠)]𝑥
0𝑑𝑠                 (4) 
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:27)  
 
Since we are talking about  the waterfront  advance  we assume  that the water front  advance  
follows  a power function  
𝑠=𝑝𝑡𝑠𝑏                                                              (5) 
Where, p and b are the fitted parameters  
Substitute for t s in Eq (4)  
𝑄0𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+∫𝑘[𝑡−(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
]𝑎
𝑥
0𝑑𝑠+∫𝑓0[𝑡−(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
]𝑥
0𝑑𝑠              (6) 
Eq (6) can be written as  
𝑄0𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+𝑘𝑡𝑎∫[1−1
𝑡(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
]𝑎
𝑥
0𝑑𝑠+𝑓0𝑡∫[1−1
𝑡(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
]𝑥
0𝑑𝑠   (7) 
.  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:39)  
 
So, the next  step is once you have that equation , you have to expand the first few terms in 
that equation , then you get first, second , third times this is called binomial expansion 
𝑄0𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+𝑘𝑡𝑎∫{1−𝑎
𝑡(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
+𝑎(𝑎−1)
2[1
𝑡(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
]2
}𝑥
0𝑑𝑠+𝑓0𝑡∫[1−1
𝑡(𝑠
𝑝)1𝑏⁄
]𝑥
0𝑑𝑠  
(8) 
And then you integrate substitute  
𝑥1𝑏⁄=(𝑝1𝑏⁄)𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑥2𝑏⁄=(𝑝2𝑏⁄)𝑡2  
Eq.(8) can be reduced to  
𝑄0𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+𝑘𝑡𝑎𝑥(1−𝑎𝑏
𝑏+1+𝑎(𝑎−1)𝑏
2(2+𝑏))+𝑓0𝑡𝑥
1+𝑏                         (9) 
 (Refer Slide Time: 24:42)  
 
Eq. (9) is further reduced to  
                              𝑄0𝑡=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥+ 𝜎𝑧𝑘𝑡𝑎𝑥+𝑓0𝑡𝑥
1+𝑏                             (10) 
Where, 𝜎𝑧=1−𝑎𝑏
1+𝑏+𝑎𝑏(𝑎−1)
2(2+𝑏) 
If we use  Kiefer expansion  and you get another  equation . 
𝜎𝑧=𝑎+𝑏−𝑎𝑏+1
(1+𝑎)(1+𝑏)                                              (11) 
And we have  recent ly reported  in 2008  that the  𝜎𝑧 by binomial exp ansion is  
𝜎𝑧(𝐵𝐴)=1.0257 ×𝜎𝑧(𝐾𝐴)    (𝑎,𝑏)∈𝑅[0,1]                     (12) 
Here a is the infiltration  parameter and b is the power  coefficient  BA is the binomial 
approximation and KA is the Kiefer  approximation . What we are doing  is we are trying to 
find out the volume balance equation by considering the surface and sub-surface  volumes   
(Refer Slide Time: 25:58)  
 
So, using the final equation  final volume balance equation  which has x and t , how do we 
find out the unknown k  and a. How do we  estimate the infiltration  parameters of the field 
by knowing  the water front  advance ? Elliott and W alker has given a procedure , for the two 
advance  points (x1, t1) and (x 2, t2), Eq (10) can be written as  
𝑄0𝑡1=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥1+𝜎𝑧𝑘𝑡1𝑎𝑥1+𝑓0𝑡1𝑥1
1+𝑏                                       (13) 
𝑄0𝑡2=𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥2+𝜎𝑧𝑘𝑡2𝑎𝑥2+𝑓0𝑡2𝑥2
1+𝑏                                       (14) 
𝑏=𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑥1/𝑥2)
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑡1/𝑡2)                                                               (15) 
The two unknown’s k and a can be estimated from the above two -equations  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:06)  
 
We have develo ped a one-point  method  so we do not require  two points  to calculate  or 
determine infiltration  parameter , even if you have one advance points , still you can 
estimate the infiltration  parameters  in the work  that we publish ed in 2008 . The basic 
assumption  here is we assume one-time point . i.e., half of the advance point  the complete 
advance point.   
One-point method (Mailapalli et al. 2008) - Considering two advance points; t 1 = 0.5 × t 2 
       (𝑥1
𝑥2)=𝑄0(0.5𝑡2)
(0.5)𝑎[𝑄0𝑡2−𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥2−𝑓0𝑡2𝑥2
1+𝑏]+𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥2+𝑓0(0.5𝑡2)𝑥2
1+𝑏                           (16) 
For example, for one -point method (Mailapalli et al. 2008), the foll owing function can be 
obtained from Eq. (15)  
      𝑓(𝑎,𝑏)=𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑔 (0.5)=𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑄0(0.5𝑡2)
(0.5)𝑎[𝑄0𝑡2−𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥2−𝑓0𝑡2𝑥2
1+𝑏]+𝜎𝑦𝐴0𝑥2+𝑓0(0.5𝑡2)𝑥2
1+𝑏)=0        (17) 
Finally,  the above  function  can be obtained , the whole procedure is given in the paper 
published in ASCE Irrigation drainage , you can go t hrough it , and this can be easily solved  
by using  excel solver . In this equation the main thing is there are  two unknowns  with one 
single  equation . This is the target of  function and by varying  a and b  using excel solver 
you can find out what are a and b values . And then once you know a and b you can find 
out the k value , by substituting these values back into the volume balance equation .   
(Refer Slide Time: 30:18)  
 
The above screenshots  show  the one-point  volume balance methods  which is  in that  paper .  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:29)  
  
Shape parameters  are very important  in order  to find out  the surface storage . We have to 
find out these  shape factors  by measuring the  furrows shape . The above figure shows  a 
typical furrow shape , it has the top width Tmx and some width in between  Ti and Tmd along 
with corresponding depths  ymx yi and ymd. If you have this data from the field you c an find 
out the shape parameter s by considering  the following  equation s: 
𝑇=𝛼1𝑦𝛼2 
𝐴=𝜎1𝑦𝜎2 
𝑊𝑃 =𝛾1𝑦𝛾2 
𝐴2𝑅43⁄=𝜌1𝐴𝜌2 
Where , 𝛼1,𝛼2, 𝜎1,𝜎2,𝛾1,𝛾2are fitted parameters; top width o f flow (T), flow area (A) and 
wetted perimeter (WP) to flow depth (y)  
The top width if you see  it changes with depth and  similarly the wetting  perimeter  and area  
of cross section is related to depths with the help of the shape/fitted parameters.

and individual value of depth , top width, σ 1, and σ 2 for borders  and basins are 1.0, 0.0, 
1.0, and 1.0, respectively .

Solution: It is assumed th at the final stable shape follows a power law, which relates top

These equations are very important in order to know the  shape parameters  which  are 
important for  simulating the  phases or  the volume  balance equation . If you have th e 
particular  data set and you can draw that in the excel and  feed in different equations .

The above  slide is an example of  two point  method  it has clearly  given Q, Manning’s n, 
𝜌1, 𝜌2, x1, t1 and x 2 t2. There is another point  b. We have estimated b  as 𝑏=𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑥1/𝑥2)
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑡1/𝑡2) 
f0 is assumed for a particular solid type we applied  as given , 𝜎𝑦 is 0.77 and the calculations 
are A0 there is  an equation for  A0. V2 and V1 these are all different volumes  and then  𝜎𝑧 
using K iefer binomial expansion  equation . Then you are going to solve the equations for 
a and then solve the equation for k. Once you got  a, b and 𝜎𝑧 then finally k value  can be 
estimate d by substituting  back in to the  volume balance equation . The curve in the excel 
sheet shows  time and infiltration  rate, which is a p ower equation   
(Refer Slide Time: 40:01)  
 
Similarly, we also have the one -point method as shown above. The function  needs to be 
optimized  and when  you get the  data, go to  the solver , and in the target cell  and we are 
going to change the variables a and b  and then solve d it. Then it will optimize  a and b  and 
using a and b , you can  estimate k value . 
(Refer Slid e Time: 41:11)  
 
The above slide shows the furrow geometry - top width , mid base and depth . So, if you 
have these  things 𝛼1,𝛼2, 𝜎1,𝜎2,𝜌1 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜌2 can be  estimated . 
In this lecture  basically we focused on the irrigation phases . There are four irrigation 
phases which are required for modeling  surface irrigation and then  we focused on volume 
balanced equation . There are four approaches approved - hydrodynamic model , zero inertia  
model , kinematic wave model and  volume  balance model . Volume balance  model is the 
simplest  among all . And we  have seen the procedure  how to  find out the infiltration  
parameters knowing the advance curve . 
Thank you .
