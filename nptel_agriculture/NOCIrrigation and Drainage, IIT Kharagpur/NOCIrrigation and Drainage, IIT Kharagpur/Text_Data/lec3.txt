Soil Properties – II 
Welcome  to lecture number 3  of Irrigation and D rainage  lecture series . In this lecture  we are 
going to see some of the soil properties  such as  soil structure, bulk density , particle density, 
void ratio , porosity.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:50)  
 
Soil structure is the arrangement of soil particles in a soil. Previously what we have learn ed 
was that the soil constitutes sand, silt  and clay, but at the same time, the individual soil 
particles are going to arrange in a definite shape. The arrangement of solid particles is 
important when you are talking about the water flow  in the soil, because it  is going to affect 
root penetration and water intake movement  that is why  the arrangement of the soil particle 
is very important.  The soil structure together with the soil texture affects soil pore, size and  
pore distribution and thus the porosi ty of the soil . When t he soil structure and soil particles 
are arranged in some manner the  arrangement of these individual particles  defin itely influence 
the pore sizes,  pore distribution and definitely that is going to ultimately influence the water 
movem ent. For example, in case of clay versus sand , the porosity of clay soil is smaller as 
compare to sand so, definitely in sand the water moves freely into the pores as compared to 
the clay soils. Micropores  help in the retention of water and solute , whereas , macropores  
which are bigger than micropores will definitely help in infiltration , drainage and aeration.  
The macropores are cause also  due to dead roots or rodents  holes or may  be cracks.  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:48)  
 
Soil structure is the arrangement of soil particles. The soil particles could be arranged in a 
granular structure as shown in the image above, you can see that all soil particles are of 
definite shape and they are closely arranged one by one or attach one to other. Another 
arrangement of soil  particles is blocky structure where the soil particles are in block shapes  
and are arranged one block to another block; one block does not mean that there is only one 
soil particle instead it contains number of soil particles and these soil particles are arranged 
in blocky  manner.  
Similarly, some  soil particles are arranged in a prismatic manner where soil particle formed 
vertical columns separated with small cracks. Soil particles are also arranged in platy 
structure, if you see in the slide above, they a re the plate like structure, so there will be 
problem in vertical water movement but horizontal movement could be possible because of 
the plates. The other structure is the columnar structures where particles are arranged like 
columns . Then  there is the ma ssive structure where  the soil particles are arranged in a big 
chunk  with big cracks . So, soil particles can be arranged together to form different shapes like 
granular, blocky, prismatic, platy structure, columnar structure and massive  structure. Our 
main  objective to study these structures is to see how they are going to influence the water 
movement in soil.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:20)  
 
 In the above picture , it is clearly showing the water movement in different types of soil 
structure. In case of gran ular structure or single grain granular structure the water flow is 
really rapid. Whereas, blocky structure if you see the water flow is moderate because of the 
blocks. And then platy structure it is very slow because you got the plates in the horizontal 
direction and the plates are arranged stacked so vertical movement will be slower. In prismatic 
structure also the water flow is moderate and in massive structure which has big chunks, the 
water only passes  through the cracks, otherwise it is very slow ; once it is moving through the 
massive structure, the water movement will be slower. The above picture shows, how the soil 
structure is going to influence the water movement.

Next is what is bulk density? Or what is the density? De nsity is mass per unit volume. Let’s 
assume, you have a volume of a particular material and you filled it in a glass. If you know 
the weight of the material filled in the glass, divided it by the glass volume; that will give the 
density of the particular m aterial , since it is in bulk so you can  say it  is bulk density . 
Similarly, soil has this physical property called bulk density. If you put soil in any glass 
knowing the soil weight and divided it by the glass volume it will give the bulk density, but 
how to estimate this in the field? A bulk density measurement kit as shown in pictures above 
is used, first you have to the dig out a hole using an auger; once the auger reaches a particular 
soil depth, for example 15 cm soil depth. Then by using soil auger you  take out the soil up to 
15 cm and then take the soil sample by using core sampler. There are different types of core 
sampler as show n in the slide above; after sampling put the caps on both sides of the core and 
find out what is the dry weight of the soil.  
The dry weight of the soil sample can be obtained by putting the material in hot air oven at 
105 oC for 24 hours, then you will get a dry weight of sample (M s) and since you know the 
soil core dimension (length and diameter) you can find out the vol ume, V =π
4d2L. Then you 
will get the bulk density; the unit  of bulk density is g/cm3. This way you can find out the bulk 
density in the field.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:05)  
 
Next is finding out the particle density. The soil will have the solid p articles as well as some 
gaps or some voids and that will be filled with water and air; so, whenever you measure the 
bulk density the volume of soil includes the voids or pores. But particle density is the mass 
of soil divided by the volume of solids only.  We can see that for particle density, we  only 
consider the volume of solids. So, how to measure this particle density in a laboratory? Let’s 
assume we have a 1000 ml of measuring jar. First measure the empty weight of jar and then 
add soil and find out th e weight of soil and jar, after that add water and take out the air gaps 
because soil contains porous space which may contains air, you have to take out that air by 
vacuuming. Then fill the jar up to 1000 ml with DI water and measure the weight. The partic le 
density is calculated as follows:  
ρs=(M2 - M1 )
(M4 - M1 )-(M3 - M2 )×ρw 
Where,  M1 is mass of bottle +Stopper; M2 is mass of bottle +Stopper+ Dry soil; M3 is mass of 
bottle +Stopper+ Dry soil + Water; M4 is mass of bottle +Stopper + full of Water ; M2 - M1 
represents the mass of dry soil used; M 3 - M2 represents the mass of water used; M 4 - M1 
represents the mass of water to fill bottle   
So, here we have taken out the voids that is why the there is no chance of air gaps in the 
measurement, otherwis e that would be equal to your bulk density, generally the particle density 
varies from 2.6 to 2.7 g/cm3. In next slide we will see basic soil water relationships.  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:53)  
 
The soil consists  of solid, water and gases and sum of the volume gases (Vg), volume of water 
(Vw) and volume of solid (Vs) will be a total volume (V t) and similarly the sum of all the 
masses of solid (Ms), water (Mw) and gas (Mg) will be total mass (Mt). With these 
information, we are going to define some commonly use r elationships.  
𝑉𝑡 = 𝑉𝑆 + 𝑉𝑤 + 𝑉𝑔              &               𝑀𝑡 = 𝑀𝑆 + 𝑀𝑤 + 𝑀𝑔 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:44)  
 
The particle density (ρ s) which is mass of solids divided by volume of solids, so mass of solids 
is in grams and volume of solids is cm3 and the particle density is varies from value 2.62 -2.7 
g/cm3; whereas, the dry bulk density (ρ b) is mass of solids divided by total volume. The main 
difference between bulk and particle density is the volume.  
𝜌𝑠=𝑀𝑠
𝑉𝑠       &    𝜌𝑏=𝑀𝑠
𝑉𝑡 
The typically  values  for bulk dens ity are 1.1 -1.6 g/cm3 for soils. Whereas, cotton crop bulk 
density will be 0.08 g/cm3. Because the cotton is very light and compare to the soil. If you put 
both in water, the cotton is going to float and soil is going to drop or sink.  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:30)  
 
What is the difference between dry bulk density and wet bulk density? If you take dry weight 
of soil that is dry bulk density, if you take wet weight of soil (ρt), it includes solids plus water 
that is wet bulk density.  
𝜌𝑡=𝑀𝑡
𝑉𝑡=𝑀𝑠+𝑀𝑤
𝑉𝑠+𝑉𝑔+𝑉𝑤 
The porosity (n) will be the volume of voids divided by total volume.  
𝑛=𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑡=𝑉𝑔+𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑠+𝑉𝑔+𝑉𝑤 
Then you have void ratio (e) which is the ratio of volume of voids to volume of solid.  
𝑒=𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑡=𝑉𝑔+𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑠 
Specific gravity is the ratio of density of solids to the density of water.  
𝐺𝑠=𝜌𝑏
𝜌𝑤 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:19)  
 
Next we are going to disc uss how much water is present in the soil called the soil moisture. 
Soil moisture is the percentage of moisture which is present in a soil or amount of moisture 
present in the  soil. The soil water can be estimated by using a moisture probes or gravimetric 
method. Here the soil water content in dry basis ( dm) is equal to mass of water divided by 
mass of solids  (θdm=Mw
Ms) . Similarly, soil water content wet basis ( wm) is mass of water 
divided by mass of solids and mass of water  θwm=Mw
Ms+Mw . M w is the mass of water 
evaporate d (g) and M s is mass of dry soil (g). Suppose you have taken a wet soil sample from 
the field, it contains mass of solids and mass of water and when you dry the soil in the oven 
the water is going to evaporate and that is M w and the amount which is left is  Ms.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:00)  
 
The above methods will give soil moisture content in weight  basis. Soil moisture is also 
measured in volumetric basis, that is volume of water (V w) divided by total volume(V t). θv=
Vw
Vt.  During the saturation all pores are filled with water, i.e., all pores in between soil particles 
will be filled with water. At saturation the volumetric moisture content will be equal to 
porosity  (θv=n). To find out the volumetric basis using the weight basis moisture content, 
the weight basis moisture content is multiplied with the apparent soil specific gravity. θv=
Asθdm. Where A s is apparent soil  specific gravity. Soil specific gravity is equal the bulk 
density of the soil divided by the density of water ( 𝐴𝑠=𝜌𝑏/𝜌𝑤). Since density of water is 
equal to 1; then the apparent specific gravity will be equal to the bulk density of soil. Hence, 
the v olumetric basis moisture content will be equal to bulk density of soil multiplied by 
moisture content in weight basis.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:00)  
 
Once we know the soil moisture which is present in the soil, how to find out the equivalent 
depth of water? o r what is the depth of water present in the soil profile? For example you have 
an experiment plot (cube) and the volumetric soil moisture is V, soil depth (L),  and the area 
(A). Then the total volume of water in the soil is equal to v ×A× L. If you divi ded this volume 
by area, then you will get the volume of water per unit area or the equivalent depth of water, 
d = v×L, which is the water available in the soil. Suppose v is 100%  that means, there is no 
soil present in the experimental plot or cube. Th is is the way we can estimate the equivalent 
depth of water .  Degree of saturation is the volume of water present in the total pore volume. 
That is how much amount of the voids are filled with water  
𝑑𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑣=𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑔+𝑉𝑤 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:33)  
 
The above images show  the pictorial way of representing the available water. In the first 
column you can see the wet soil sample column and thi s column has soil particles and also 
the voids which are occupied by water this is called the wet weight of soil. When you dry it 
the water will evaporated and you can clearly see the solids and voids in the dry soil column. 
The water  which  is evaporated, if  you put that back into the column or cylinder that will 
occupy a depth called the equivalent depth and other depth of the column is the bulk volume. 
So, this way you can clearly say the amount of water which is present inside the column.  
(Refer Slide Time : 35:15)  
 
So, here we have some relationships; so, we already know what is ϴv; what is ϴdm which is 
the soil moisture in dry basis and soil moisture wet basis  ϴwm. So, here f is the porosity which 
also represented as n and ρb is the b ulk density and  ρs is the particle density. The equation s 
in above  slide show the  inter-relationships  among different  soil properties .  
For example, here if you see f =1 –(ρb/ρs).  
Now,    ρb= Ms
Vt         &          ρb= Ms
Vs 
𝜌𝑏
𝜌𝑠=𝑀𝑠
𝑉𝑡
𝑀𝑠
𝑉𝑠= 𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑡= 𝑉𝑡−𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑡=1−𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑡=1−𝑓 
So,      𝑓=1−𝜌𝑏
𝜌𝑠 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:09)  
 
So, similarly you can also find other relationship  also.  
Now next,  
𝑓= 𝑒
1+𝑒 
𝑒=𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠 
1+𝑒=1+𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠= 𝑉𝑠+𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠= 𝑉𝑡
𝑉𝑠 
𝑒
1+𝑒= 𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑡
𝑉𝑠= 𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑡=𝑓 
Finally,  
𝑓= 𝑒
1+𝑒 
 
Similarly, you can prove other relationships right. So, remember these relationships is very 
important for solving problems.  
 
Thank you so much.
