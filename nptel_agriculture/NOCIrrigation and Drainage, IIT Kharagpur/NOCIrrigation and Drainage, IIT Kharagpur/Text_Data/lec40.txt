Tutorial  
Hello, this is lecture  number  40 on Tutorial . So whatever we learned in the last  four 
lecture s this week , we are going to see some of the problems  which are  frequently asked 
in the GATE  examination and other competitive examinations and also some additional 
problems .

Example W8.1:  
If an irrigation water source has the concentrations of Na+, Ca++ and Mg++ as 28, 10 and 5 
milliequivalents per litre, respectively, then the Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of this 
water is                   (Gate 2015)

Example W8.2:  A tile drainage system draining 12 ha flows at the design capacity for two 
days in response to a storm. If the system is designed using a drainage coefficient of 1.25 
cm, the amount of water removed from the drainage area during two days is  (GATE 2008)  
Solution:  
Given ,  A= 12 ha = 12×104 m2 
drainage coefficient = 1.25 cm=0.0125 m

12×104=1500  
=1500  m3/day 
= 3000 m3 in two days

Example W8.3:  
A soil has a field capacity of 25%, a permanent wilting point of 11% , and an apparent 
specific gravity of 1.6. Irrigation is applied after depilation 40% of the available moisture 
to crop with root zone depth 600 mm, the electrical concavity of the saturation extract of 
the soil is 10 mmho/cm and that of the irrigation water is 2.5 mmho/cm. Determine the 
leaching requirement and the total depth of the irrigation.        (GATE 1998)  
Solution:   
Given,  
Field capacity (FC)= 25%  
Permanent w ilting point (PWP) =11%  
Specific gravity (SG)= 1.6  
(Refer Slide Time:  05:19)  
 
Root zone depth (RZ) = 600 mm  
The e lectrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil = 10 mmho/cm  
Irrigation water Electrical conductivity = 2.5 mmho/cm .

Example W8.4:  An agricultural soil contains 47% pore space, and the moisture content 
after gravity drainage is 39% (by volume). Find the void ratio, drainable porosity, and 
drainable water volume from a 20 m × 15 m plot having 1.0 m root zone depth.  
Solution:  
Given,  
The volume  of void =47%   
water  content  after  gravity  drainage =39%  
We know,     
𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑑  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜  = (𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑑 / 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑 ) 
= 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑑 /(100 − 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑣𝑜𝑖𝑑 ) 
= 47/(100 − 47) 
= 0.886

= 47 − 39 
= 8% 
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  = 𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦  × 𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  
= (8/100 ) × (20 × 15 × 1 𝑚3)

Example W8.5:  Runoff water from the watershed enters into a drainage area for 5 hours 
at the rate of 24 m3/s. The total rainfall during 24 h periods is 10 cm and infiltration during 
the same periods is 2 cm. If the total drainage area is 500 ha and the crop can tolerate a 
ponding of 14 cm, calculate the drainage coefficie nt of the land.  
Solution:  
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎  𝑖𝑛 5 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠  =5×3600 ×24=432000  m3 
𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑡𝑜 𝑎 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ=432000
500 ×10000  =0.0864  𝑚  
= 8.64 𝑐𝑚 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡  𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎  =(10−2)+8.64 
=16.64 𝑐𝑚 
(Refer Slide Time:  13:49)  
 
 Therefore,  
𝐷𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑡𝑜 𝑏𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑑  = 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 −𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
−𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔  𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑑   
= 16.64−14 
=2.64 𝑐𝑚 (Ans.)  
This is the drainage co-efficient of the land  
So with these example s, we finish ed the tutorial for this week . So, this week , we cover ed 
the soil salinity and then sodicity agricultural drainage  concept  and agricultural  drainage  - 
introduction  and then today’s tutorial . So in the next  week , we are going to focus  on the 
drainage  design , both surface and subsurface drainage , and then  the tutorials and case 
studies .  
Thank you .
