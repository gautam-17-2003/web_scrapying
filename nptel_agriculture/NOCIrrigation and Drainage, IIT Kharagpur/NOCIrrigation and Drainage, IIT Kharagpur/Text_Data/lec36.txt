Management of Salt Affected Soil  
Hi, this is lecture number 36 on Management of Salt Affected Soils  which is divided into  two 
lectures; in the first lecture we are going to learn some terminologies  on salt -affected on lands 
and then how do you estimate the leaching f raction , how to calculate  the salt stress coefficient , 
water stress coefficient  and then the combined salt and water stress coefficients. In the next 
lecture , we are going to see some of the examples of these terminologies and then sodic soils 
and other things   
(Refer Slide Time: 01:11)  
 
So, what is the salinity? salinity refers to the amount of soluble salts present in the soil. So, 
soluble salts could be sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium , magnesium salt and  several  other  
salts. So, the soluble salts which are present in the s oil represented salinit y where as sodicity 
is exclusively for sodium salt which is present in the soil.  Around the world , there  are 80 
mha of lands  being  affected  by salinity.  At every minute around 3 h a of land is being 
affected with or converted into saline soil.  The world ’s area of saline and sodic soils  is 
around 394 and 434 mha, respectively . And the extent and distribution of salt -affected soil  
in India is 6.7 million hectares . If you see th e Indian map  in the slide above , the black  shade 
or black stripes  are lands affected by salinity.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:17)  
 
What are the salinity units? how to measure the soil salinity or water salinity? The units are 
measured in electrical conductivity units (EC) using an electrical conductivity meter  as 
discussed earlier in previous classes. So, using th e meter we are going to measure electrical 
conductivity. So, generally , the units of electrical conductivity is decisiemens /meter (dS/m) 
and or millimohs per centimeter (mmohs/cm) . To convert the electrica l conductivity of 
irrigation water (EC iw) into the concentration of salts , Ciw = 640× EC iw the concentration is 
generally measured in ppm or m g/l. T he 640 may vary from  region to region  and you can use  
this roughly , but to adjust this you have to do some ki nd of trials . The standard measurement 
for soil salinity is expressed as a saturated paste extract  (EC e). Measuring the salinity of water 
is easy , by just  putting the electric conductivity meter in the water sample and you get the 
meter reading in dS/m . 
Whereas, for the soil, because it is a solid material  you have to extract the solutes from the 
soil by adding water and saturating it completely and then bring it  to slurry  form . Then you 
have to extract water out of the paste and the water will be used to measure the soil salinity. 
So, that is why it is called soil salinity which is expressed as saturated paste extract salinity.  
Suppose you have  soil and you add DI water and then make a paste  of it and  then leave it for 
one day . The next day you filter it , the water which is coming out from the filter will be used 
to analyze the electrical conductivity  so that is why that is saturated paste extract equivalent.  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:49)  
 
Next, is what is osmotic potential ? When you are talking about salinity the potential which is 
related to salinit y is osmotic potential.  So, because of this , the water extraction by plants is 
limited . Water with a higher concentration of salts has lower energy that means  it's more 
negative  so it will induce more sucti on th an water with lower solute concentration. So, if you 
have a beaker with a semi -permeable layer in between saltwater and freshwater , after 
equilibrium if you observe the freshwater level goes down whereas, the saltwater level goes 
up. 
So, that means, the saltwater is not a bsorbing  water further. So, there is a transportation of 
salts to freshwater, but what happened after equilibrium? You can see the water which is going 
into the saline water and saline water level increased  and there is a gap between the initial and 
final and this creates the suction . So, that means, if you have a plant in the saline water the 
water will be pulled towards the saltwater and creating suction to the plant. So, water is driven 
towards a higher salinity region , and therefor e, the plant has difficulty  in pulling water from 
high saline soils. So , because of that , more suction will be created in the root zone. So, the 
osmotic potential energy saturated soils.  
The osmotic potential energy in saturated soils:  
   ψo=−3.6×EC e 
Wher e EC e is the electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract, dS/m; ψo is the osmotic 
potential, m.  
So, the above simple equation is for converting the electrical conductivity of the soil into 
osmotic potential.  As the soil dries, the salinity incre ases. The osmotic potential is as a 
function of water content is  
ψo=−3.6×ECe×𝜃𝑠
𝜃 
Where θ s is the saturated water content (by volume); θ is the actual water content (by volume)  
The negativ e means more suction is going to be  created . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:02)  
 
Example 36.1: Calculate osm otic potential in the soil at 25% water content if EC e=1 dS/m, and 
water content is 50%.  
Solution:  
The osmotic potential as a function of water content is  
ψo=−3.6×ECe×𝜃𝑠
𝜃 
ψo=−3.6×1×100
50 
ψo=−7.2 m=−0.72 atmospheres  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:30)  
 
Next is the salinity stress coefficient , similar to your crop coefficient you have salinity stress 
coefficient and water stress coefficient. So what exactly is the salinity stress coefficient?  The 
increas e in soil salinity decre ases the water uptake as I mentioned before, thus decrease s the 
yield. Once the plant is not able to extract or pull water from the soil the plant is going to show 
water stress and that reduc es the  yield.  So, in th e graph above if you see the salt salinity  levels 
plus saturated paste extract of soil salinity is on X -axis and the relative yield which  is the  actual 
yield by th e maximum yield is on the Y -axis;  as salinity increases the relative yield is going to 
be almost constant for up to a certain salinity then after that the salinity effect is going to 
influence on the yield. So, salinity up to some level is not going to influence yield and we call 
this a threshold salinity.  If you see from th e graph which  is an example of the response of cotton 
to increase  in saturated paste extract salinity  when  EC exceeds 7.7 the yield begins to decrease  
but up to 7.7 the yield is not going to be affected by salinity. The crops that are classified as 
sensitive and moderately sensitive and moderately tolerant and tolerant to salinity have no 
reduction yield at EC e 1, 3, 6, and 9.5 dS/m respectively . So, based on that concept the crops 
are classified, because the crop the response to particular thresholds is different from  plant to 
plant or crop to crop.  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:23)  
 
For example, vegetable crops are generally sensitive and moderately sensitive to salinity.  
Field crops such as cotton wheat barley tend to be l ess sensitive to salinity . The  natural 
resources conservation services –classif y the irrigation salinity levels as no restriction on use 
for EC iw < 0.7, slight to moderate restriction for 0.7 < EC iw < 3.0 , and severe restriction for 
EC iw>3; this is based o n the irrigation water, the previous is based on the soil salinity.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:55)  
 
So salinity stress coefficient is denoted with K s-salt which is expressed as  
𝐾𝑠−𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑡 =1−𝑏
100 ×𝐾𝑦(𝐸𝐶𝑒−𝐸𝐶𝑒𝑡 ) 
Where b is the slope of EC e/yield line,  %/(dS/m); EC et is the threshold saturated paste extract 
EC e with no yield decrease, dS/m; Ks-salt is the salinity stress coefficient, varies from 0 to 1; Ky 
is the crop sensitive to water stress  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:40)  
 
The water stress coefficient is generally calculated under the assumption that yield decreases 
linearly with the increased percentage of water depletion. So, similar to salinity stress the 
water stress coefficient is the amount of water that is less when  compared to the field capacity 
or available water . So, the threshold percentage of w ater depletion θt similar to your sal inity 
stress , up to certain water cont ent the crop does not show any yield reduction, but there is a 
threshold water level. So, beyond that , it is going to show yield  reduction . For example , if you 
remember the management allowable depletion that is MAD this is similar to that, it is a water 
content in which yield starts to decrease.  Thus, the water stress coefficient Ks-water decreases 
linearly from 1 at θ t to 0 at θ pwp; that means between θFC and θt the plant does not show any 
yield reduction , you get maximum yield , then after that at θt you get actual yield and at θpwp 
the yield is going to be declined maybe you get 0 yield s. So, using that concept K s water is given 
as follows  
𝐾𝑠−𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 =𝜃−𝜃𝑃𝑊𝑃
𝜃𝑡−𝜃𝑃𝑊𝑃 
𝜃𝑡=𝜃𝐹𝐶−(𝑝
100)(𝜃𝐹𝐶−𝜃𝑃𝑊𝑃) 
p is the point at which yield decreases in contrast to MAD, this is kind of a threshold point at 
which the yield is going to decline, maybe equal to P or less than P.  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:42)  
 
So, what is the stress coefficient? So,  the combination of both water as well as salt stress 
coefficients . 
𝐾𝑠=𝐾𝑠−𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑡  × 𝐾𝑠−𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  
And the relation between the yield decreased and combined stress which is equal to  
1−(𝑌𝑎
𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥)=𝐾𝑦(1−𝐾𝑠) 
Where K y is the crop sensitivity to water stress; Ya is the actual yield, kg/ha; Ymax is the 
maximum potential yield, kg/ha.  
The graph above is showing the K s versus water content curve , or percentage depletion and 
Ks. So, if yo u see  θt is the threshold  and there  is θFC at field capacity and  θpwp. When the % 
depletion is up to θt the K s is almost constant or is equal to  1 then after that  as the  depletion 
level up the K s started  declining up to 0 at θpwp. The θt for drought -sensitive crop, moderately 
drought -tolerant crop , and the drought -tolerant crop is shown in the graph above . There is 
another classification of θt based on the p-value which is  25% for drought -sensitive crop and 
50 % for the drought -tolerant crop . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:35)  
 
So, now from the previous equation , you can rearrange to solve the actual yield  
𝑌𝑎=(1−𝐾𝑦(1−𝐾𝑠))𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥  
The table above presents the crop sensitive water stress the K y values for different crops. So, 
you can adopt from this table an d substitute it  in the equation  and get the actual yield.  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:05)  
 
Example  36.2  
Calculate actual yield for cotton for a growing season if average salinity during the growing 
season is 10.4 dS/m, and average water content is 14 %. θ fc = 20%, θpwp = 10%. K y = 0.85. 
Max yield = 1,285 kg/ha. MAD = 50%. Threshold EC et = 7.7 dS/m and b = 5.2.  
Solution:   
𝜃𝑡 = 𝜃𝐹𝐶 −(𝑀𝐴𝐷
100)×(𝜃𝐹𝐶−𝜃𝑃𝑊𝑃 ) 
θt = 20-(0.5/100) (20 -10)=15%  
𝐾𝑠−𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 =𝜃−𝜃𝑝𝑤𝑝
𝜃𝑡−𝜃𝑝𝑤𝑝    = 0.14−0.10
0.15−0.10  = 0.8  
Calculate K s_salt 
𝐾𝑠−𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑡 =1−𝑏
100 ×𝐾𝑦(𝐸𝐶𝑒−𝐸𝐶𝑒𝑡 ) = 1−5.2
100 ×0.85(10.4−7.7) = 0.83  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:23)  
 
Now, knowing th ese two stress, you can get the combined salt and water stress.  
Calculate total K s 
Ks = K s_water × K s_salt 
     = 0.80 × 0.83 = 0.67  
Calculate yield  
𝑌𝑎=(1−𝐾𝑦(1−𝐾𝑠))𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥 =(1−0.85(1−0.67))1285 = 924 kg/ha  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:18)  
 
Example 36.3  
Calculate the yield reduction for sugar beets. Assume 80 cm is applied and 100 cm is required. 
Ymax = 40 tons/ha.  
Solution:   
From Table, K y for sugar beat is 1.0.  
The yield based on the FAO, K y slope is calculated as follows:  
𝑌𝑎=(1−𝐾𝑦(1−𝐾𝑠))𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥  =    (1−𝐾𝑦(1−𝐸𝑇𝐶_𝑎𝑑𝑗
𝐸𝑇𝐶))𝑌𝑚𝑎𝑥   
= (1−1.0(1−80
100))40 = 32 t/ha  
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:39)  
 
So, the other one i s the salt balance at the farm level, it follow s the simple mass balance 
equation as follows . 
[ρw(𝑉𝑖𝐶𝑖+𝑉𝑟𝐶𝑟+𝑉𝑔𝐶𝑔)+𝑀𝑠+𝑀𝑎]−[ρw(𝑉𝑑𝐶𝑑+𝑉𝑠𝑑𝐶𝑠𝑑+𝑉𝑝𝑤𝐶𝑝𝑤)+𝑀𝑝]=△Msw 
Where,  
Vi, Vr, Vg = the volume of water added to the same volume of soil by irrigation, rainfall, and 
upward flux (capillary rise), respectively, C i, Cr, Cg = concentration of salt in irrigation water, 
rainwater, and groundwater, respectively, mg/l  
Vd, Vsd, Vpw = volume of water removed by deep drainage, surface drainage, and plant uptake, 
respectively, L  
Cd, C sd, C pw = concentrations of salt in deep drainage, surface drainage, and plant uptake 
water, respectively, mg/l  
Ms = mass of salt dissolved from soil mine ral of a specified (or unit) soil volume, mg  
Ma = mass of salt from agricultural inputs, mg  
Mp = mass of salts precipitated (turned into solid), mg  
△Msw= change in mass of salt in the soil’s liquid phase  
ρw = density of water, 1000 mg/L  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:22)  
 
For the st eady-state model ( Hillel, 1998 ) the assum ptions are  the salinity concentration during 
season and year is constant that means, there is no change  △Msw=0 and in -situ precipitation 
(liquid to solid ) and dissolution (solid to liquid ) of salt  is negligible that means, M s, M p, and 
Ma are all 0 and crops removed a negligible amount of salt that (Mc=0).  
(𝑉𝑖𝐶𝑖+𝑉𝑟𝐶𝑟)= (𝑉𝑑−𝑉𝑔)𝐶𝑑 
If C in is the average weighted salinity of the precipitation and irrigation water, and V g is 
negligible, then  
 𝑉𝑖𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑛= 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡   or   𝑑𝑖𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑛= 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡  by replacing water volume with water 
depth, d  
(Refer Slide Time: 35:24)  
 
So, now, what is the leaching fraction.  Leaching fraction denoted with LF is the leaching 
depth or seepage depth  divided by the applied depth where i in the following includes 
precipitation as well as irrigation . Leaching fraction is the amount of water that is being used 
to leach the salts from the soil body . If C in is the average salinity in both irrigation and 
precipitation  then  
𝐿𝐹=𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑑𝑖𝑛 = 𝑑𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒
𝑖 
Since,  
 𝑑𝑖𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑛= 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 
 𝑑𝑖𝑛𝐶𝑖𝑛= LF×𝑖×𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 
𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡= 𝐶𝑖𝑛
𝐿𝐹 
Because EC is propositional to concentration C, the leachate salinity for uniform water 
application can be written as  
𝐸𝐶𝑑𝑤=𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤
𝐿𝐹 
Where EC dw is the electrical conductivity of drainage water (leachate or seepage), dS/m. EC iw 
is the electrical con ductivity of irrigation water, dS/m.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:56)  
 
The depth of drainage water is equal to the irrigation water minus d ET. So,  
Substitute into  𝐿𝐹=𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑑𝑖𝑛 = 𝑑𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑔𝑒
𝑖 
dout = I - dET 
LF=i−dET
i 
So, this is the leaching fraction in terms of water depths, knowing the water depths you can 
get the leaching fraction. But there is an empirical equation for knowing the salt content or 
salt concentration or electrical conductivity of both irrigation water and soil.  
𝐿𝐹=𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤
5×𝐸𝐶𝑒 −𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤 
So, this is an empirical equation mostly considered as a standard equation to estimate the 
leaching  fraction.  
This is the end of the lecture , in this lecture , we focused on what is salinity and how it is 
measured and what are the units a nd what is th e osmotic potential , and how do you estimate 
osmotic potential. And then what is the soil stress coefficient , water stress coefficient and how 
do you get the combined salt stress and water stress coefficient , and how to estimate the yield 
reduction due to salt stress  and water  stress  coefficients.  And finally,  what  is a salt balanced 
equation  and what is the steady -state salt balance equation  and finally leaching  fraction , how 
to estimate the leaching fraction knowing the inflows and outflows as well as their 
concentrations.  
Thank you.
