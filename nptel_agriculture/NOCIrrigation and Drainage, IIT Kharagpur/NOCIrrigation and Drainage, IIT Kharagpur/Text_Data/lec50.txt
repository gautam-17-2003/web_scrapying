Lecture - 50 Tutorial  
Friends  welcome to lecture number 50  which is mostly on the Tutorials or workout problems 
dealing with the subsurface drainage using Hooghoudt equation and Glover -Dumm equation 
and finding out the drain spacing and the drain  pipe length, pipe diameter , etc. 
(Refer Slide Ti me: 00:49)  
 
So, here is example W10.1:  
Tile drains have to be installed in an agricultural land having soil permeability of 2.3 × 10-3 
mm/s. An impermeable stratum exists at 3.2 m below the land surface, and it is desired to 
keep the water level at least 1.0 m below the land surface. The average discharge of the 
drainage system is 2.0 mm day-1. If the tile drains are planned to be placed at 1.5 m below the 
land surface, the drain spacing in m (assuming the equivalent depth to be the same as the tile 
depth) , is             
Solution:  
Given  
Soil permeability, K = 2.3 × 10-3 mm/s = 198.72 mm/day  
Average discharge of the drainage system, q = 2.0 mm/day  
  Equivalent depth d e = d = 1.5 m  
ℎ=0.5 𝑚.

𝐿=√695.52=26.37 𝑚 𝐴𝑛𝑠.

Example W10.2:  
In an ir rigation command area, the irrigation interval, gross application in irrigation , and the 
application efficiency are 20 days, 75 mm , and 60%, respectively. The soil is homogeneous 
with K = 0.9 m day-1. The impermeable layer is at a depth of 7 m from the gr ound surface. 
The area is to be a tile drain with tiles at a depth of 2 m below the ground surface. The 
maximum permissible steady -state water table height mid -way between the drains, from the 
plane of the drain, is 1.2 m. using the steady -state approach of Hooghoudt, assuming an 
equivalent depth of 4.12 m, the drain spacing in m will be                    
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:59)  
 
Solution:  
Given  
Irrigation interval = 20 days  
Gross application in an irrigation = 75 mm  
Application efficiency are = 60%,  
Therefore,  𝑞=75
20×0.6 
=2.25𝑚𝑚
𝑑𝑎𝑦=0.00225𝑚
𝑑𝑎𝑦 
K = 0.9 m/day  
Impermeable layer depth from the ground surface = 7 m.  
Tile drains depth below the ground surface= 2 m.  
h = 1.2 m.  
Equivalent depth d e = d = 4.12 m  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:11)  
 
We know Hooghoudt’s equation  
𝑞=8𝐾𝑑ℎ
𝐿2+4𝐾ℎ2
𝐿2 
Substituting values in Hooghoudt’s equation  
0.00225=8×0.9×4.12×1.2
𝐿2+4×0.9×1.22
𝐿2 
𝐿2=35.6+5.184
0.00225=40.784
0.00225=18126.222 
𝐿=√18126.222=134.63 𝑚 (Ans.) 
So, this is  similar to the previous problem the only thing is q needs to be determined based on 
the irrigation efficiency, gross water requirement , and also the irrigation interval.

Example W10.3:  
The EC of the canal water used for irrigating wheat is 1.2 mmhos/cm while it can tolerate a 
maximum EC of 6 mmhos/cm. the ET of wheat is 0.8 cm/day and soil hydraulic conductivity 
is 0.9 cm/h. the area is to be drained by the tile drain laid at a depth of 2.5 m below ground 
level to maintained water table depth at 1.5m the imperv ious layer is located at a depth of 4 m 
below the ground surface.  
Compute the drain spacing using Hooghoudt,s equation.  
Calculate the drainage flow rate out of a 400 ha field  
What is the size of the drain pipe laid out on a gradient of 0.001 m/m, assuring tha t drain is 
running full and Manning is 0.01?                    
Solution:  
Given,  
𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤= 1.2 mmhos/cm  
𝐸𝐶𝑑𝑤= 6 mmhos/cm  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:09)  
 
ET = 0.8 cm/day  
Soil hydraulic conductivity = 0.9 cm/h.  
Tile drain depth = 2.5 m  
water table depth =  1.5m  
impervious layer = 4 m  
Area = 400 ha  
Gradient = 0.001 m/m,

Example W10.4:  The following data were obtained from an agricultur al land requiring a pipe 
drainage system for groundwater control: Hydraulic conductivity = 8.3 cm/h, drainable 
porosity = 5%, reaction factor = 0.31 per day , and equivalent depth to the impermeable layer = 
2.8 m  The drain spacing computed by the Glover -Dumn formula will be

Example W10.5:  
A subsurface drainage system is installed in an agricultural area to control the water table. 
The design discharge rate of the drain is 2 mm/day. The depth of the water table midway 
between the drain is 1.5 m below the soil surface. A drainpipe with a radius of  0.10 m is 
installed at a depth of 2 m. There is an impervious layer at a depth of 7 m below the soil 
surface. The hydraulic conductivity of the homogeneous soil above the impervious layer is 
1m/day.  
a. If the flow rate takes place only below the drain level  the equivalent depth for a drain 
spacing of 90 m is  
b. If the flow rate water takes place only above the drain leve l, the drain spacing is        
Solution:  
Given, 
Discharge rate of the drain (q) = 2 mm/day=0.002 m/day  
 
hydraulic conductivity (K) =1 m/day

So, this is all in this  tutorial we were talking about the steady -state problems, as well as one 
problem on unsteady state problem using Glover -Dumm equation. Otherwise , most of the 
problems are related to the Hooghoudt equation. And we have seen a variety of equations, 
finding out spacing, finding out the drain flow rate , and contributions flow above  and below 
the drain base depth. These problems  will help in understanding the problems right related to 
the surface as well as subsurface drainage systems design . 
Thank you so much.
