Lecture – 51: Surface Drainage System Design  
Friends welcome to lecture number 51 on Surface Drainage System Design. So, in this lecture , 
we are going to see the  design of surface drainage . It has two components: one is a hydrologic 
design and the other is a hydraulic design. In this lecture we will focus on hydrologic  design;  
mostly finding out the peak flow rate from a drainage area . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:51)  
 
Surface drainage removes excess water accumulated over the land surface in crop area s. Since 
we were interested in  agricultural fields so our focus is to remove excess water from the 
farmland.  So, what are the sources of th is excess water , basically the rainfall , local runoff , 
incoming water from adjoining higher area of seepage flow , and excess irrigation water , these 
are going to cause  excess  water  and incr ease the natural  runoff.  And then sometimes  the 
lateral seepage which is taking place from one field to another field , may cause the surface 
water po nding or water logging hence  it requires  surface drainage.  
The design of surface drainage consists of two stages  one is a hydrologic design and then the 
hydraulic design. Hydrologic designs involve  the quantification of excess water to be d rained 
and the rate at which it is to be drained , these two things we need to determine . Whereas, 
hydraulic design ,  involves calculating the drainage channel geometry and the drainage network 
layout. So, once  the channel geometry is estimated based on the peak flow rate,  then we are 
going to decide which layout  we need to use e.g., parallel grid design or random designs - these 
things have already been discussed in the previou s lectures.  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:05)  
 
So, in hydrologic design , the first is  the estimation of surface runoff. The most famous  
methodology used to estimate the surface runoff is the Rational Method , this is the most  
common method and it uses an empirical relationship to  estimate the peak runoff rate which is  
𝑄𝑝=  𝐶𝐼𝐴
360 
Where,  𝑄𝑝= peak flow (m3/s); 𝐶=dimensionless runoff coefficient ; 𝐼= rainfall inten sity for a 
given return period. Return period is the average numbe r of years within which a given rainfall 
event will be expected to occur at least once ; 𝐴 = area of the catchment (ha)  
The basic assumptions in the Rationa l Method are the uniform rainfall intensity for a duration 
at least equal to the time of concentration . The other as sumption is the rainfall should be of 
uniform  intensity should have uniform intensity throughout the area of the watershed.  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:11)  
 
Example 51.1  A cultivated area of 40 ha drains to a particular storm water inlet. The runoff 
coefficient for this drainage area has been estimated to be 0.4. Based on a specified design 
return period and the time of concentration of the drainage area, the design storm intensity 
has been determined to be 10 mm/h. What is the peak runoff rate from this area to be used 
for the design of the storm water inlet?  
Solution:  
𝑄𝑝=  𝐶𝐼𝐴
360 
𝑄𝑝=0.4 ×10×40
360=0.44  𝑚3/𝑠𝑒𝑐 
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:26)  
 
Next is  the procedure for the rational method , first is the  area of catchment , which  is determined 
from  surveying or  maps , or aerial photographs.  
Then the next parameter is the runoff coefficient , C. This is a measure of the rain which 
becomes runoff. When C = 1 that means, rainfall is completely turned into a runoff, whereas if 
C = 0.1, that means, around 10 percent  or nine-tenths of the rain is soaked in.  
A table is shown above and you can use it to find  out the runoff coefficient C for different 
topography, vegetation , and soil texture . The table has different topography and vegetation on  
column number one and the soil texture on column two  (open sandy loam) , three  (clay and silty 
loam) , four  (tight clay) . Based on the  combination  of a particular topography and vegetation 
and the soil type , you can decide the runoff coefficient . E.g., the runoff coefficient for tight 
clay results generally  in more runoff because of less infiltration. S o, the values are increasing 
when you go from wood land to urban areas . So, similarly , in the case of sandy  soil, the runoff 
coefficient is increasing. That means runoff is higher in the case of urban areas and sand will 
have less runoff compared to silt and clay . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:05)  
 
The next is rainfall intensity , so according t o the desired return period  for the design of the 
structure under study.  The duration of the rainfall intensity is equal to the time of concentration 
of the runoff or T c; so the basic assumption  of the rational method  is the duration should be  at 
least the time of concentration. So, for estimating  the time of concentration, the Kirpich 
equation is used which is a function of the  drainage length and then slope . Tc is the time taken 
for the most remote area of the catchment to contribute water to the outlet.   
𝑇𝑐=   0.0195   𝐿0.77𝑆−0.385  
Where  Tc is the time of concentration (min); L is the maximum length of flow (m); S is the 
watershed gradient (m/m) .  The same equation can be trans lated into a tabular form  as shown 
in the table above  so, you can  either use the equation or the table . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:49)  
 
And then , how to find out the rainfall intensities? If you see the  pic or graph above  the duration 
or Tc is in minutes because we assume  that the duration  is equal to the time of concentration  
and it is represented  in the x -axis; then the rainfall intensity I is in the y-axis and if you see th e 
curves  in the graph they  are representing the  return period . So knowing the return period and 
duration of time of concentration we can find out intensity. The Tc is estimated using the 
previous equation or table. So, let us say for T c 60 min  and 20 year return period the rainfall 
intensity is  around 70 mm /h. So, this way you can find out the rainfall intensity.  
Generally , the return period  for field structures is 5 to 10 years , gully control and smal l farm 
dams  it is 20 years and for large f arm dams , it is 50 years.  Based on these thumb rules we can 
select a particular return period and for a particular time of concentration , you can estimate the 
rainfall intensity in mm /h. Knowing  the area, intensity , and runoff coefficient you can find out 
the peak discharge . 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:47)  
 
Example 51.2  
A catchment of 15 ha is composed of 5 ha of permanent pasture (Soil Group B) and 10 ha of 
row crop in poor con dition (Soil Group C). What peak flow is to be expected from a 1 in a 5-
year storm? The maximum flow length is 610 m, with a gradient of 2%.  
Solution:   
Using the table in the slide above for maximum flow length of 610 m and catchment slope of 
2%, by inter polating Tc = 12 minutes  
From equation,  
𝑇𝑐=   0.0195   𝐿0.77𝑆−0.385 =   0.0195   6100.770.02−0.385 =12 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑠  
From Tc_Table or Tc_equation, T c = 12 minutes  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:21)  
 
So, the time of concentrations  is estimated . 
From the table, above the return period with different  rainfall intensity  duration of  10, 30, 60 , 
and 120 mins are shown . So for 12 minute and 5 year return period , you get the rainfall  intensity 
of 73 mm/h  (by interpolation ).  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:29)  
 
Next is  the runoff coefficient which is obtained from the  table given by  US SCS (United States 
Soil Conservation Services ). So, in th e table above the coefficient C is given for  different  cover 
and conditions  in the first column; and then the soil group A, B, C, and D  in the second, third 
fourth , and fifth column s. 
Runoff coefficient C for permanent pasture  
(Group B, 5 ha) = 0.14  
Runoff coefficient C for poor row crop  
(Group C, 10 ha) = 0.71  
Weighted value of C for the whole water shed: 0.52 
Substituting in Ration al formula:  
𝑄𝑝 = 0.0028  × 0.52 ×73.0 × 15  
𝑄𝑝 = 1.6 𝑚3/𝑠 
 (Refer Slide Time: 18:43)  
 
And next is the Cook’s Method for determining the surface runoff which is developed by the 
USCS  United States Soil Conservation Service . It provides a simpler  and more generalized 
appro ach than the Rational Method.  
It requires the catchment size and the condition. S o, with these two things , we will be able to 
find out the peak discharge. So, in the table  above  in column number one  is the conditions  
involv ing four conditions : relief, soil infiltrat ion, vegetation cover, surface storage . And in the 
first row is  the peaks; classified into four classes , extreme peaks, high peaks, normal peaks, 
and low peaks.  
So, based on the peak type weights are assign ed for different conditions , if you sum them 
column -wise it will give the magnitude of the peak . So,  e.g., in high peaks , case-hilly land 
slopes  of 10 to 30% the weight age is 30 and for slow  to take water  clays , low infiltration  the 
weig htage is  15. So, like that you get  extreme pea ks -100, high peaks -75, normal peaks -50, and 
low peaks -25.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:46)  
 
So, then the next step is, when a total of catchment condition values is made, the peak flow 
(m3/s) is estimated using the  table  in the slide above.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:26)  
 
Next is the SCS-CN method  that is a Soil Conservation Service Curve Number Method. This 
method is based on the relationship between rainfall amount and direct runoff.  So, the 
relationships are defined in series of curvilinear graphs which are called Curves. So, each curve 
represents the relationship betwee n rainfall and runoff for a set of hydrological conditions. So, 
the equation governing the relationship between rainfall and runoff is  
𝑄 = (𝑃−0.2𝑆)2
(𝑃+ 0.85𝑆 ) 
Where Q = direct surface runoff depth in mm; P = storm rainfall in mm; S = the maximum 
potential difference between rainfall and runoff in mm, starting at the time the storm begins.  
Soil reservoir which can accept the inflow  or infiltration or all losses or abstractions so that is 
S so, here we have to find out S  and S is a function of curve number.  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:06)  
 
Now , the parameter S is essentially composed of losses from runoff to interception, infiltration, 
etc. The US SCS calculates S by:  
𝑆=25400  
𝐶𝑁−254 
CN is the "Curve Number", from 0 to 100.  
Curve Number 100  assumes total runoff from the rainfall and therefore S = 0 and P = Q.  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:13)  
 
So, in the table above , curve numbers are show n for different soil groups. In column  1 is the 
land use  which can be  fallow row crops , small grain , close seeded legumes , or rotation  meadow 
pasture , or range  permanent meadow,  woods , and farmstead roads . In the second column is the 
treatments  which can be  a straight row , contoured , terraced , and then condition  in the third 
column which can be poor, good , or fair. And the curve number  is given  for different  soil 
group s. 
The is soil groups are defined  as 
Soil group A – Well -drained sand or gravel, high infiltration rate  
Soil group B – Moderately well -drained soil, moderate infiltration rate, with fine to moderately 
coarse texture  
Soil group C – Slow infiltration rate, moderate to fine texture  
Soil group D – Very slow infiltration, mainly clay material, relatively impervious   
(Refer Slide Tim e: 26:08)  
 
So, there is also a table from where you can get the direct runoff.  In the graph above the rainfall 
is on the  x-axis and the  lines are the curve numbers  from 40 to  100 and in the y-axis is a direct 
runoff. So, knowi ng the rainfall , for example, 8 is the rainfall 65 is the curve number  then the 
corresponding runoff will be  almost  4 inches So, out of 8 inches of rain 4 inch turns into  a 
direct runoff for a curve number of 65 . 
Antecedent moisture current  or AMC is divided into three types  
AMC I – Dry soil  
AMC II – Average soil moisture  
AMC III – Wet soil  
So, these curves will be adjusted based on the AMC values.  The AMC is very important if the 
soil is initially wet , it will result  in more runoff compared to AMC  II and AMC  I. So, once we 
get the direct runoff from the particular cu rve number , based on the AMC it will be adjusted . 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:00)  
 
Example 51.3: In a 350 ha watershed the CN value was assessed as 70 for AMC III.  
(a) Estimate the value of direct runoff volume for the following 4 days of rainfall.  The AMC 
on July 1st was of category III. Use standard  SCS-CN equations.  
(b) What would be the runoff volume if the CN III value were 80?

Rainfall, mm  50 20 30 18 
Solution:                                           
Given                                                        CN III = 70 
𝑆=25400  
70−254 =108 .86 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:20)  
 
𝑄= (𝑃−0.2𝑆 )2
𝑃+0.8 S 
𝑄= (𝑃−0.2×108.86  )2
𝑃+0.8 ×108 .86 
𝑄= (𝑃−21.78)2
𝑃+87.09 For P> 21.78 mm  
Date  P, mm  Q, mm  
July 1  50 5.81 
July 2  20 0 
July 3  30 0.58 
July 4  18 0

1000=22365  m3 
(b) So, similarly , for CN III = 80 
𝑆=25400  
80−254 =63.5 
𝑄= (𝑃−0.2𝑆 )2
𝑃+0.8 S 
𝑄= (𝑃−0.2×63.5 )2
𝑃+0.8 ×63.5 
𝑄= (𝑃−12.7)2
𝑃+50.8 For P> 12.7 mm  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:29)  
 
Date  P, mm  Q, mm  
July 1  50 13.8 
July 2  20 0.75 
July 3  30 3.7 
July 4  18 0.41 
Total  118 18.66  
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑜𝑓𝑓  𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟  𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 , 𝑉𝑟=350 ×104×18.66 
1000=65310  m3 
So, all precipitation values are going to result in the runoff , in this case , the total  runoff depth 
would be 18.66 and the total runoff over catchment 65310  m3 is the runoff volume. So, for 
increasing curve numbers runoff volume is increasing . 
This is all in this  lecture hydrologic design of surface drainage system. In the next lecture , we 
are going to talk about the hydraulic  design of the surface drainage system . 
Thank you.
