Introduction  
Hello friends, welcome to the NPTEL course on Irrigation and Drainage. So, I am Damondhara 
Rao Mailapalli  and I am an assistant professor in Agricultural and Food Engineering 
Department IIT Kharagpur.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:38)  
 
 
These are the  highlights of the course , we are going to have two modules. O ne is on irrigation  
and the other one is on drainage. It is a 12 weeks course and each week we are going to cover 
5 lecture s and each lecture will be of approximately 30 minutes  long. All together it will be of 
60 lectures and also we going to have a tutorial s on GATE , ICAR , JRF problems at the end of 
each week  that means the 5th lecture of the week will be on the tutorials . During the course 
work  there will be some assignments to give  training to the students and along with quizzes . 
And then  there is  an online discussion, if you have  questions or enquires , we can discuss online  
and we are going  to have two technical assistants to support in this discussion and they are my 
PhD students.

Now  what exactly is irrig ation and drainage? In the agriculture fields  you can see  two cases, in 
the first case there is a dry field and the other case will be a wet field contain ing some wa ter 
ponded on the soil surface. In dry case;  it does not mean that the water is  not there, definitely 
there is water within the soil profile  and is called the groundwater . So, if the groundwater is 
nearer  to the surface and the plants are grown i n the fields,  in that case , you need  not give 
irrigation to the plants because plan ts can extract water from the root zone, or from the water 
table . If the water table is  deeper  then we need to give water artificially on the surface  and that 
water will penetrate into the  soil and it will be available to the plant s. Whereas,  in the drainage 
case what happens is , the fields are ponded with water always. So, in order to grow crops in 
that particular piece of land, you need to take up the excess water from the surface. So, how do 
you do that, you can either provide field channel s on the surface or you provide some 
subsurface drainage pipes . 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:00)  
 
 
In the both irrigation and drainage cases, our objective or major goal is to maintain suitable 
environment for the plants to grow. The learning out come in this  the course includes:  
1. Understanding irrigation and drainage principles which is important in the design of 
irrigation or drainage system.  
2. Design gravity and pressurized irrigation systems - in irrigation system, there are 
surface irrigation s where you provide water on the surface by gravity force, and there is 
pressurized irrigation system for example, micro irrigation or drip irrigation where you need 
to pressurized the irrigation through pumps so that water can penetrate  through the small p ores 
of dripper or sprinklers.  
3. Understanding the groundwater hydraulics is important to know how water flows from 
the surface to the drains in case of drainage.  
4. Design surface and subsurface drainage systems  - once you understand the governing 
equations and the principles, you will able to design surface and subsurface drainage systems.  
5. To be acquainted with some irrigation and drainage models used for simulating 
irrigation and drainages cases and we are going to discuss about those models later.  
6. To know  about water lifting devices and pumps, so if you have water underground, 
how to tap the water using the pumps.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:22)  
 
There are several reference books available, but mostly we will be using Irrigation Theory 
and Practice by a A. M. M ichael and, Land drainage by Bhattacharya and Michael. And there 
are other foreign editions you can go through, in order to understand the principles.  
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:50)  
 
Sustainable development and efficient management of water is challenging in I ndia because:  
1. The water tables  are declining day bay day due to the over exploitation of water for 
drinking and irrigation purposes, that burdens a farmer to tap water from the deeper aquifers.  
2. Incomplete major and medium irrigation projects - there are many projects which 
under construction and are pending because of political or financial status; and they are not 
finished in time.  
3. Very slow increase in gross irrigated area - in every budget the government is 
providing lot of funds for irrigation, but it  is not helping to increase the gross irrigated area  
4. And then the quality of water in rivers and lakes are  really degrading day by day   
5. Increasing water conflicts within India for example, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, 
Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh and our neighboring countries for example, India and 
Pakistan, India and Nepal, India and Bangladesh,  and the conflicts are inc reasing  
So, because of these  the water management is really challenging in India.

In the above table you can s ee that though India has 16% of world’s population, it has only 
4% of the total available fresh water. The annual precipitation volume we receive from rainfall 
including snowfall is around 4000 Km3, but the average annual potential flow in rivers is only 
about 50% of the  annual precipitation volume and the utilizable water resources is around 
28% of annual precipitation which is classified as surface and groundwater resources with the 
surface water resources around 60% and ground water about 40%.   
(Refer Sl ide Time: 10:18)  
 
This table above shows the per capita water availability in India, which is declining with 
increasing population. As per the international norms if the per capita water availability is 
<1700 m3 cube per year, the country is under water s tressed condition. And if it is < 1000 m3 
cube per year the country is in water scarce condition. Seeing these numbers India is going to 
reach the water stressed condition and, in near future the water scares condition.  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:03)  
 
The irrigation potential of water in India  is shown in  the slide above. The total geographical 
area of India is 329 mha  and, the net sown  area 141 mha w h i ch  is 43% of 329 mha. The 
gross irrigation area is 87.23 mha and the net irrigated area is 62.31 mha. The difference 
between  the gross irrigated areas and net irrigated area is that, in case of gross irrigated area so 
you will be counting a crop which is grown repeatedly in a particular year. The productivity 
under irrigated condition is 2.5 ton/ha whereas , in rain fed  condition it is 0.5 ton/ha which is 
very low compare to the irrigated condition; therefore,  you can understand the irrigation 
potential here and the importance of irrigation. The food grain availability is around 523 
g/capita/day.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:22)  
 
The productivity of cereals in India is presented in the slide above, you can see rice is 
consuming almost double the water required for other crops, around 120 cm whereas the yield 
is pretty much the same with other crops so the water  productivity is definitely less in case of 
rice because, it is consuming lots of water.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:50)  
 
Irrigation is the artificial application of water to the soil, in order to grow the crop profitably. 
Irrigation water is generally applied when there is no rainfall, or groundwater sources and the 
main concerns in irrigation is when to apply, how much to apply and how to apply; So, these 
three things are very important when you decide,  or schedule an irrigation to plant s. 
(Refer Slide Time: 1 3:25)  
 
Irrigation development has played a key role in strengthening economy because, irrigation is 
applying water for the benefit of the crop so, directly you are producing crops which will 
influence the  economy. If you have more grains production it will give more profits to 
strengthens the economy. The employment opportunity will increase because when the crop 
production is more, it will drive the rural youth into the agro -business and definitely the 
employment o pportunity will increase. Irrigation development  provide self -sufficiency in 
food production, because if you supply enough water to the crops they will provide more yield 
and cause more food production  
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:26)  
 
Another benefits of irrigation are being able to grow crops where, nothing would grow 
otherwise, for example if you have a lot of water you can grow crops even in deserts areas . 
More profitable crop can be grown for example, if you are cultivating alfalfa which is fodder 
crop which requires a lot of water, instead the same water can be used to grow a more profitable 
crop like wheat. Irrigation increase the yield/quality of crop, since you are not making any 
water stress condition, the quality and  yield of t he crop will improve.  Irrigation increase the 
aesthetic value of the landscape, if you have lot of water, then you can use it for landscaping 
and, definitely that improves the aesthetic value of the area.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:26)  
 
Other benefits of irrig ation are leaching of salts, if you have problems with salts in soil you 
can irrigate the soil to leach out the salts. Wind erosion can be controlled by irrigating the soil 
surface it will make the ground wet and the wind cannot blow the soil  particles. Mu ltiple 
cropping during the year is possible with irrigation, you can grow 2 -3 types of crops in a year. 
 
Irrigation increases employment opportunities  and reduces risk of crop failures because you 
are not growing  crops under water stress condition so defini tely that will improve the crop 
condition and reduces crop failures. Irrigation also improves socioeconomic conditions by 
increasing the rural population income generation and hence increase the socioeconomic  
condition.  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:27)  
 
The disa dvantage  of irrigation is that excess irrigation is going to decrease the crop yield 
because, if you put lot of water the crop roots will be submerged continuously and the water 
acts as oxygen barrier so roots cannot take any oxygen into the soil. And ther e by definitely 
reducing the crop yield because of oxygen stress condition. The chemicals such as pesticides 
or fertilizers and salt s can be leached into the groundwater or transport into the surface waters. 
Yield reduction can happen  if you have a deficit  irrigation , not only excess irrigation  but even 
if you reduce  irrigation also called as deficit irrigation it is  definitely going to reduce the yield. 
Excess irrigation causes water logging and salinity problem ; for example, in a field ponded 
with water on the surface it does not allow any oxygen to enter into the soil creating 
unfavorable conditions for plant growth. The image in slide above is of India map showing 
the ground water withdrawal as percentage of rec harge. It can be seen that states like Punjab, 
Haryana, Delh i and Rajasthan withdraw ground water more than the recharge. It is an alarming 
situation that the groundwater table is depleting deeper and deeper into the  soil.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:35)  
Irrigat ion projects in India are classified into three major classes one is the major irrigation 
projects with irrigation potential > 10000 ha and cost of project >  5 cr. And the medium 
irrigation projects have  irrigation potential of about 2000 to 10000  ha and t he cost of project is 
25 to 50 lakhs. And then the minor irrigation projects having irrigating potential of < 2000 ha 
and the cost of project will be less than 25 lakhs.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:30)  
 
The status of surface irrigation systems in In dia is that the water used for  gross irrigated area 
of 87 mha is 541 km3 under surface irrigation systems. The gross water used  is 1.45 m in case 
of surface irrigation which is greater than that of the united states which is 0.9 m indicating  
that we are putting more w ater on top surface as compared to the United States in case of 
surface irrigation systems. The overall irrigation efficiency in the country is 38 percent that 
means, if you are supplying 100 mm of water to the field only 38 mm of wa ter is being taken 
by the plant  or farm. River basins like Krishna, Godavari, Cauvery and Mahanadi systems 
have very low efficiency of around 27 % whereas, Indus ganga systems are doing better with 
 
an efficiency of 43  to 47 % because, they have well-structured  water release syst ems for 
example Warabandi system.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:00)  
 
Pressurized irrigation system like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation systems have higher 
efficiencies. Drip irrigation saves 25 to 60 percentage of water and increase the yield up to 
60%.  Whereas sprinkler irrigation saves 25 to 33 % of water. The net area under drip irrigation 
is 0.5 mha and sprinkler is 0.7 mha, though we have a target of about 10 % of gross irrigated 
area that needs to be under brought under micro irrigation systems.  Maharashtra has the largest 
area under micro irrigation system.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:50)  
 
The irrigation efficiency of surface irrigation is about 30 to 40 % only, the reasons for this 
low irrigation efficiency are unlined canal systems with excessive see page. Canals  system that 
we have are mostly unlined so the water which is being delivered from t he canal to field level, 
is being  lost through seepages or evaporation mostly. Then lack of properly designed field 
channels required, for delivering water effi ciently to the fields also cause low irrigation 
 
efficiency. Lack of canal communication network also reduces the efficiency, if you don’t 
have proper canal communication network you won’t know when to release water for a 
particular command area and definit ely the scheduling will be affected, it may be faster or 
slower, or one day early or one day late. And the lack of field drainage is another important 
factor causing the low irrigation efficiency because the excess water which is accumulating 
on the surfac e needs to be taken out from the fields and for that the field drainage is required. 
And improper field leveling is also very important in order to increase the uniform ity of water 
distribution. T he price of water is very less, so people take for granted a nd does not consider 
the effect on irrigation efficiency.  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:34)  
 
Gross command area  (GCA)  is the total area that includes roads, villages farmstead, etc. lying 
between drainage boundaries which can be irrigated by a canal system. but if you are only 
accounting the farm lands that is the culturable command area  (CCA) . The gross command 
area contains both the culturable command area and the other area which is not culturable 
called unculturable command area. So, the sum of these two will be the gross command area. 
Unculturable command area include unfertile barren land, alkaline soils, local ponds, villages.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:14)  
 
Intensity of irrigation  is the ratio of irrigated to irrigable area. For example,  you have some area 
available for irrigation, but based on your water availability/water resources, you decided to 
irrigate part of your land, so the ratio of irrigated land to irrigable land will g ive the intensity 
of irrigation. Water tanks are dug areas which can be useful to store the excess rain water  
Outlets are kind of head regulator at the field level, to deliver water to the fields.  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:00)  
 
Water logged areas is an agri cultural land which is said to be water logged when productivity 
or fertility is affected by high water table. In this case water table rises up and you can always 
see the water on the surface . Field capacity is the water content held in the soil after exc ess 
water has drained and plants can extract sufficient water from the soil for its growth. After a 
heavy rainfall, there will be lot of water ponded on the surface but if you go in the next morning 
the water will be receding slowly and you may not be seei ng the water on the surface anymore, 
because the water has escape through over land flow, or through deep percolation. But the soil 
still contains some water, and the amount of water which is available during that time or after 
 
1 or 2 days of heavy rainfal l is called the field capacity.  Permanent wilting point or the wilting 
coefficient is the water content at which plants can no longer extract sufficient water from the 
soil for its growth., then the plant starts show wilting nature. We will discuss more on  this in 
the upcoming lectures.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 27:37)  
 
Generally, we have two crops seasons Kharif and Rabi season. So, crop ratio is the ratio of 
cultivable area under different crops during different seasons in a crop year. For example, you 
are cultivating rice in Kharif and Rabi. So, the ratio of cultivable area during Rabi and Kharif 
will give the crop ratio. Crop period is the number of days betwee n sowing and harvesting of 
crop. Base period is a period or number of days between the first wate ring at the time of 
sowing to the last watering before harvesting.  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:25)  
 
Live storage, dead storage and gross storage are three terminology used to describe a reservoir . 
Live storage (LS) is the complete water stored in the reservoirs  between full reservoir level 
 
and dead storage level, this water is available for usage  
Dead storage (DS) is the water stored in a reservoir between the lowest supply level and the 
deepest river bed level, which is 10 % of  gross storage (GS)  
Gross storage  is the storage capacity between full water reservoir level and deepest reservoir 
level. GS =LS+DS;  GS=LS+0.1* GS;      GS =LS/0.9  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:01) 
 
Delta is the total depth of irrigation water required by a crop during the cropping period or 
base period. That is the total depth of water you are providing to the crop during the first water 
application to the last wate r application before harvesting  of a crop. S uppose a crop required 
about 12 irrigations  of 10 cm  depth that gives you 120 cm of depth of water you provided 
during the base period or the delta of the crop is 120 cm. Suppose A ha is the area under a 
particular crop the total water require wou ld be 1.2 × A (ha -m) over the period of 120 days.  
(Refer Slide Time: 31:11)  
 
Duty (ha/cumec) is the area  you irrigated  per unit volume  of water. It  is the ratio between  
the irrigated crop area and the quantity of irrigation water required during  the base  period.  
 
Suppose if you have 3 cumec of irrigation water, required for crop sown over an area of 5100 
ha. The duty will be the area divided by the volume  so, that will be 5100/3 = 1700 ha/cumec 
and 3 cumec discharge would be required throughout the base pe riod.  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:36)  
 
The value of duty would be different at the head of the watercourse, or at the head of the 
distributary. So, relationship between duty  D and delta  ∆ is  
∆=8.64𝐵
𝐷 
Where B is the base period. The unit of d uty is h a/cumec , cumec  is m3/s and ha is 104 m2 and 
convert seconds to  days then you  will get the factor 8.64.  
(Refer Slide Time:  34:16)   
 
Here is an example we will be solving  
EXAMPLE 1.1  An irrigation canal has a GCA of 80000 ha out of which 85% is culturable 
 
area. T he intensity of irrigation for Kharif season is 30% and for Rabi season 60%. Find the 
discharge required at the head of the canal if the Duty at its head is 800 ha/cumec for Kharif 
season and 1700 ha/cumec for Rabi season.  
Solution:  
Culturable Irrigable ar ea= 80000× 0.85 = 68000 ha  
Area under Kharif season = 68000 × 0.30 = 20400 ha (Irrigated)  
Area under Rabi season = 68000 × 0.60 = 40800 ha (Irrigated)  
Water required at the head of canal to irrigate during  
Kharif is 20400/800 cumec = 25.5 cumec and (this is area divided by duty ) 
Rabi is 40800/1700 cumec = 24 cumec  
So how to decide which  discharge is required at the head of the canal ; the general thumb rule 
is you always go with higher discharge. So, that it can serve both Rabi and Kharif season.  Since 
the water requirement in Kharif season is higher than Rabi season, canal must be designed to 
carry an a verage discharge of 25.5 cumec.  
(Refer Slide Time: 37:17)  
 
Now let’s solve the next example  
EXAMPLE 1.2 A watercourse has a culturable command a rea of 2600 ha, out of which the 
intensities of irrigation for perennial sugarcane and rice crops are 20% and 40%, respectively. 
The Duty for these crops at the head of the watercourse is 750 ha/cumec and 1800 ha/cumec, 
respectively. Find the discharge req uired at the head of watercourse if the peak demand is 
20% higher than the average requirement.  
Solution:  
Area under sugarcane = 2600 × 0.2 = 520 ha  
 
Area under rice = 2600 × 0.4 =1040 ha  
Water required for sugarcane = 520/750 = 0.694 cumec  
Water requiremen t for rice = 1040/1800 = 0.577 cumec  
Since sugarcane is perennial crop, it will require water throughout the year. hence watercourse 
should carry total discharge of (0.694 + 0.577 ) = 1.271 cumec.  
The peak design discharged  is 20 percent higher  
Hence, peak  design discharge = 1.271 × 1.2 = 1.52 cumec
