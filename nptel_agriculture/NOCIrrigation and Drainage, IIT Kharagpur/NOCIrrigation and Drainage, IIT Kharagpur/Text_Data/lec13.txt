Measurement of I rrigation Water: Open channel  
 
Welcome to  lecture  number 13 of Irrigation and Drainage lecture series . In this lecture 
we are going to  talk about the  measurement  devices , how do we measu re flow in streams 
and pipes  concentrating  on th e water delivery system from canal to field channels . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:51)  
 
Before going to the d etails  let us know some basic terminologies and also the hydraulic  
principles of flow. The first thing is the flow rate or discharge  denoted as Q , flow rate  is 
the amount  or volume of water which is flowing through a channel or  pipe per  second or 
per unit time is called the di scharge , generally the units are m3/s or l/s. The velocity  of 
approach is the velocity with which the fluid is approaching the measurement device . 
Generally , velocity is given as follows  
𝑉=𝑄
𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎  𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:38)  
 
Next is the continuity  equation  which  is very important when  you are talking about  
measuring fluid  at more than one  point . The continuity equation assumes that  the quantity 
of fluid flowing per  second through a conduit , at all sections is constant  i.e., it is 
considering  no loss  from the system or gain from outside the system . 
 
Suppose you have a conduit (as shown in the figure above) with two sections : section 1 
having cross sectional area A 1 and section 2 with cross sectional area A 2 and the fluid  is 
flowing with velocity V1 through the section  1 and leaving with velocity V2 at section  2. 
There is no fluid which is adding across  or fluid leaving from the system so, in this system , 
we can use the continuity equation  
𝑄=𝐴1𝑉1=𝐴2𝑉2 
So, the product of area and velocity at section 1 is equal to product of  area and velocity  at 
section 2 so, this is the continuity equation . If you have more sections and then area and 
velocity at the other section s will be equal to  Q because there is no addition of fluid or 
there is no  loss of fluid from the conduit .  
Next is the  fluid pressure , fluid pressure  follows the well-known  law called Pascal ’s Law. 
Pascal ’s laws states that a fluid  at rest (static) or in motion  (dynamic ) exerts pressure on 
its surface . In a static fluid , the intensity  of pressure at a point is equal in  all directions . Let 
us assume  a triangle as shown in the following figure with  fluid  pressure which is acting 
on the face AC of the triangle which is equal to the fluid  pressure  which is acting on face 
AB and is equal with fluid  pressure  which is acting on  face BC. So, this triangle will be in 
static position since the pressure exerting within the system is equally distributed . So, in 
the static position the pressure exerts in each and every part will be equal , this is the 
Pascal ’s law . 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:51)  
 
In an open channel flow if the velocity , depth of flow and the fluid  flow rate do not change 
with time , that is called  the steady  flow else it is unsteady .  
For Steady flow;  
𝑑𝑉
𝑑𝑡=0,  𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑡=0,  𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡=0,  
 and Unsteady flow;  
𝑑𝑉
𝑑𝑡≠0,  𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑡≠0,  𝑑𝑄
𝑑𝑡≠0 
Uniform and non -uniform  flow refer to  change with respect to  the space  whereas,  steady 
and unsteady is with respect to the time .  
Bernoulli ’s equation states that in a steady  flow of a n incompressible  fluid , the total energy 
at any point of  the fluid is constant ; Bernoulli’s equation for non-viscous  fluid between 
two points of a flowing path ca n be written as:  
𝑃1+𝑉12
2𝑔+𝑍1=𝑃2+𝑉22
2𝑔+𝑍2 
Where P is the pressure head; 𝑉2
2𝑔 is the kinetic head; Z is the elevation head  
Suppose , you have the fluid which is  flowing through the conduit or any open channel  
having  section  1 and section 2. The Bernoulli ’s equation  presents  that the total energy at 
section 1 is equal to  total energy  at section 2. Generally,  the total energy contains three 
components , the pressure  energy  and the velocity  which is the kinetic energy and  the 
potential ener gy. The Bernoulli ’s principle  states that at any point  throughout  this fluid 
flow the total energy is constant . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:06)  
 
Specific energy is defined as the energy per unit weight of fluid . Whatever the energy we 
have  seen earlier in the p revious slide  per unit weight  is the specific energy . Since we are 
targeting the fluid , the energy due to elevation wo uld not be coming to the picture . So, the 
specific energy  is given as follows  
𝐸=ℎ+𝑉12
2𝑔 
Critical depth is the depth of flow  when the specific energy is minimum  and the velocity 
of the flow  at critical depth is also known as critical velocity . Generally we use this 
terminology  in hydraulic jump , let us say there is a structured as shown in the following 
figure and  the fluid is flowing on top having  YHW head or depth  there after, the fluid head 
is falling  and the flow is  experiencing su percritical flow . After falling, the head i s going 
to rise  and experience  a subcritical  flow. T he energy  will be  minimum at one point  and the 
depth at  which the total energy or the specific energy is the minimum  is called the critical 
depth .  
 
So, you can clearly see in the following figure , h2 which  is the initial depth ; hc is the  depth 
at which the specific energy is minimum  and h1 is the depth  which is  less than h c. If you 
see graph in the following figure  the energy  is on x-axis and height  is on the y -axis. The 
dotted straight  line passing through hc divide  the subcritical and supercritical flow . The 
blue curved line represents  the constant flow . At the minimum specific energy and the 
correspond ing depth hc is called critical depth .

Flow measuring devices are broadly classified  into volumetric measurements , area 
velocity method s or tracer methods  for measuring flow r ate in streams . The tools or  devices 
used to measure flow  can be categorized into volumetric flo w measuring devices  viz., 
notches , weirs , flumes , venturimeters , orifice meter , magnetic meter  or ultrasonic meter . 
There are  velocity measuring devices like cu rrent meter , pitot tube and float etc . and water 
level  measuring devices like staff gauge , meter  scale , water  level sensor , ultrasonic water 
level  sensor etc. So, these things are very much required for measuring the discharge  in 
the flowing streams . 
(Refe r Slide Time: 13:50)  
 
Volumetric  measurement  is a simple  method  for measuring the discharge, one of the 
volumetric method is  the bucket and stopwatch method . So, here the flow which is  taking 
place is allowed  to pass  through a pipe then you can measure  the volume of water which 
is collected in a bucket , for a particular time interval . The number of buckets  divided by 
the total time will give the discharge . So, discharge is a volume of water collected in a 
bucket by time required  to filled the buckets . 
Suppose you targeted 10 mins time, start the timer and wait for 10 mins and get the volume 
of water which is be ing collected  in a bucket  during the 10 mins time  and divide it by 1 0 
mins  that will give the discharge . This method  is not suitable for large disch arge or open 
channel flow  because , for open channel flow you have to concentrate the flow and allow  
it to passed through  a pipe or you have to obstruct the flow in order  to measur e it, but this 
is very well accepted method for small pipes .  
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide T ime: 15:30)  
 
Next is the area velocity method , we know the discharge is  equal to area into velocity  so, 
that is why this method is called area velocity  method . It has  two components , you have 
to measure the area and the velocity and then product will giv e the discharge . For example,  
in open channels , with channel cross section  A and velocity of flow, V  the flow rate (Q) is 
calculated as:  
𝑄=𝐴×𝑉 
But if it is an irregular cross section  so, you have to measure the velocity  at different cross  
section  and at different points along  the cross section . The first part you need to trace  and 
measure the cross section  and the next is to measure velocity at different points along  the 
cross section .  
 
So, for example, taking a small  section  as shown in the figure  above , having width W and 
then let u s say d1 and d2 are two depths  that will give the trapezoidal  cross section . And 
then the velocity is measured at  0.2d and 0.8d and average them . And then  you will get the 
delta Q, which is the flow rate for this secti on, 
∆Q = (W×d1+𝑑2
2)×V0.2d+V0.8d
2 (For depth  ≤ 1m)   
or 
∆Q = W×d1+𝑑2
2×V0.6d  (For depth > 1m)  
Then  similarly flow rate  for each section  is calculated a nd summation of all  the ∆Q will 
give the total  discharge in the channel . 
Total discharge 𝑄=∑∆𝑄 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:06)  
 
Next is the tracer method , in this method  a particular tracer is be ing injected at the head 
end and you are going to  measure i ts concentration at the downstream . This principle  is 
based on the mass conservation  princ iple and you are  going to estimate the flow rate . 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:33)  
 
How the flow rate  is estimated using the tracer  method ? For example, if you see the 
conservation equation ; 
𝑄0×𝐶𝑏+𝑞×𝐶1=(𝑄0+𝑞)×𝐶2 
Where, 𝑄0= flow rate o f the stream, 𝑞= injection rate of concentrated tracer in the stream, 
𝐶𝑏=background tracer concentration in stream, 𝐶1= concentration of tracer in the prepared 
solution, 𝐶2= concentration of tracer in the downstream water.  If you rearrange  the above 
equation for Q 0; so, finally, you will  achieve th e following  equa tion  
𝑄0= 𝑞 (𝐶1 − 𝐶2)
𝐶2 − 𝐶𝑏 
So, this is equation you going to use in order to measure  or estimate the discharge in a 
stream  using tracer  method .  
(Refer Slid e Time: 20:24)  
 
Next is the float method , which involve a  surface float or a material that can float . This is 
a rough estimation , but it is a very easy method  if you have  a float. For example, there are 
two operators  or two persons at a known  distanc e as shown in the following figure . Then 
the person a t the upstream end is going to leave a float and he note d the initial time  which 
is the time when he releases the float  and the person downstream will note the time when 
he receives the float so you wil l find out how long  it takes for the float to travel from th e 
upstream operator to downstream operator . It is a simple method where  we measure the 
velocity which is the distance by time . 
 
In open  channels  the velocity profile at the top /surface  is highest  and is lowest  at the 
bottom . So, since the float is floating  on the  top surface  so, it is going to experience the  
maximum velocity  then in order to estimate the mean velocity , the surface velocity or the 
float velocity  is multiplied  with 0.8. Once you g et the mean velocity and knowing the cross  
section , you can estimate the discharge .  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:54)  
 
Current meter  is also  used to measure  the velocity of the flow . The current term indicates 
the flow that is why  it is called  the flow meter  or current meter . In this meter , there are a 
number of  cups mounting on the axis  along with  the tail  as shown in the first figure  above. 
You have to put this  current meter into  the stream and  based on the flo w the cups are going 
to rotate . The number of ro tations w ill be calibrated  against the flow rate . In the image 
above  you see the  person who is using current meter to measure the flow rate  in a streams ; 
the discharge is equal to the flow cross section multiplied by  flow velocities  similar to the 
previous  method . So, current method give s the velocity and if you know the cross section 
area Q is equal to area into  velocity .  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:15)  
 
Water depth measurement devices are shown in the images above such as  staff gauge , 
water level sensors, ult rasonic water level sensors. I f you go to the roadside or any  streams  
where a staff  is installed at the  gauging site, you can clearly see the height of water which 
is present in the stream . Water level sensors  are also used to measure the water level;  it 
works on the  principle of  resistance  so based on the resistance  signal you can convert  it 
into water level . The ultrasonic level sensor  emitted acoustic wave and receive a weak 
return ing acoustic wave  and the difference will be  converted into voltage and vol tage will 
give the water level . All these devices are calibrated  ones. 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:32)  
 
Measuring structures for example, notches and weirs  are shown in the image above, t he 
first image is a  rectangular notch , which is a rectangular piece which is made up of metal . 
There is a gauging gauge  and this gauge gives the depth  and knowing the  cross section  of 
the notch you can estimate the discharge  which is a  function of height  along with the  
correct correction factor Cd. Similar ly if it is a trian gular shape it is called triangular notch . 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:36)  
 
And then  we have  trapezoidal notch  (as shown in the first image above),  in case of  a 
rectangular notch  there is end contraction  so the velocity of flow /discharge may be  
interrupted . So, if you have  the triangular slots at the end and m ade i t the trapezoidal one , 
then the discharge will be higher . Stepped notch (as shown in the 2nd image above) is used 
if you have the flow rate which is varying too much  in the  streams . Stepped  notch  can 
measure the  lower  discharges and higher discharges , using  the same  notch .  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:38)  
 
Next are the weirs , the difference between  weir and not ch is that notch  are the devices 
made up of mostly  metal sheets and the weirs are made up of cement  concrete . So, weirs 
hold the larger discharges whereas,  notches measure the smalle r discharges . Similar to the 
notches we have  the classification  according  to the shape of opening , i.e., rectangular weir 
with rectangular opening and trapezoidal weir with  trapezoidal opening . A trapezoidal 
weir which has a 4 vertical and 1 horizontal side slope  is called  a Cipoletti weir . 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:38)  
 
The other  classification is according to the nature of  discharge , there is a  regular  weir and 
there is a submerged weir . So, in the  both cases h 1 is the  depth  at head end and h2 is the 
depth  on tail end . Calculat ion of discharge in both case is almost same  but, in this case of 
submerged weir when you calculate  it should be h1 minus h 2.  
(Refer Slide Time: 2 8:52)  
 
The next  classification is according to  the w idth of the weir  which is the narrow crested  
weir and broad crested  weir. In case of narrow crested  weir, h1 which is the depth  above 
the crest is greater than 4 times width of the weir  and in broad cres ted weir h 1 is less than 
4 times width of the weir . 
(Refer Slide Time: 29:36)  
 
And then next classification is according to the  nature of crest : sharp crested weir and  ogee  
weir. The sharp crested weir thickness  is < h1/2 generally whereas , in ogee weir  similar to 
the sharp  crested weir , but at the tip  it is going to be maximum at one point  that is 0.115 *H 
and then  after that  it follows a parabola . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:32)  
 
According to the effect of the si des on emerging nappe  there is  suppressed rect angular 
weir and contracted rectangular weir . In suppressed rectangular weir the length of the weir 
will be equal to length  of the water which is staying on top of the weir but in contracted 
rectangular weir the weir width and the channel wi dth is less th an the w eir length  due to 
the presence of end contractions . 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:18)  
 
How to measure the discharges in the  measuring structures ? For example, you have a  
rectangular w eir so, how to estimate the discharge . Consider an elementary horizontal  strip 
of water thickness dh and length L at a depth h from the water surface . 
Area of strip = 𝐿 𝑥 𝑑ℎ 
Theoretical velocity of water = √2𝑔ℎ 
Therefore, discharge through strip =  𝐶𝑑×𝐿×𝑑ℎ×√2𝑔ℎ 
Where C d = coefficient of discharge  
By integrating above equation with limits 0 to H we can get the total discharge 
Q=∫( 𝐶𝑑×𝐿×𝑑ℎ×√2𝑔ℎ)𝐻
0 
Finally discharge over the weir 𝑄= 2
3𝐶𝑑×𝐿×√2𝑔×H3/2 
Contracted rectangular weir 𝑄= 2
3𝐶𝑑×(𝐿−0.2𝐻)×√2𝑔×H3/2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:59)  
 
In case of triangular weir,  we follow the  similar  procedure . Consider ing an elementa ry 
horizontal strip of water of thickness dh at a depth h from the water surface.  
Area of strip = 𝑑ℎ 𝑥 2𝐴𝐶 = 2 (𝐻−ℎ) 𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝜃/2) 𝑑ℎ 
Theoretical velocity of water = √2𝑔ℎ 
Therefore, discharge through strip =  𝐶𝑑2 (H-h)tan( θ/2)dh √2𝑔ℎ 
By inte grating above equation with limits 0 to H we can get the total discharge 
Q=∫( 2𝐶𝑑 (H-h)tan( θ/2)dh √2𝑔ℎ)𝐻
0 
Finally discharge over the weir 𝑄= 8
15𝐶𝑑×tan(θ/2)×√2𝑔×H5
2 
(Refer Slide Time: 34:32)  
 
And then  so, the next is to measure  the discharge through trapezoidal or Cipoletti  weir. It 
has two components ; one is  rectangular weir  right , the other one is  the triangular weir that 
is why here we take  this is a  discharge principle for rectangular  and triangular weir . 
The discharge over  a Trapezoidal  weir  
𝑄=( 2
3𝐶𝑑×𝐿×√2𝑔×H3/2)+( 8
15𝐶𝑑×tan(θ/2)×√2𝑔×H5/2) 
Where, Q = discharge, L/s; L= length of crest, cm H = head over the weir, cm, Cd = 
Coefficient of discharge, 𝑔= acceleration due to gravity. Because of t he contractions  in the 
rectangular weir the discharge is going to be decreased . So, in order to increase the 
discharge  right  without having any e ffect on th e contractions  the triangular openings  are 
added,  then the discharge will increase . so, that i s why  the total discharge through the  
trapezoidal  weir or Cipoletti  weir (side slopes 1:4 ) is a combination of rectangular and 
triangular weir . 
(Refer Slide Time: 35:58)  
 
And then  so, next let us solve a  problem . 
A rectangular notch has a discharge of 0.24 m3/s, when head of water is 800 mm. Find the 
length of notch. Assume Cd=0.6.  
Solution:  
Given,  Q = 0.24 m3/s, H = 800 mm = 0.8 m, 𝐶𝑑 = 0.6

(Refer Slid e Time: 36:56)  
 
Example 2 Find the discharge over a triangular notch of angle 600, when head over 
triangular notch is 0.2m. Assume C d=0.6 
Solution:  
Given,      θ = 600; H = 0.2 m ; Cd = 0.6

So, this is all  about this  lecture , mostly in this lecture we  covered the main principle  
involved in flow measurement devices and what are the measurement methods ; so mostly 
the area velocity method volume  method  and then tracer  method , the float method . So, 
these are the methods  commonly used in stream  flow measurement . And in addition to that 
there are some structures like weirs , notches  and then flumes . We are going to talk about 
the flumes  and some  measuring device s for the flow through pipes in the next class .  
Thank you .
