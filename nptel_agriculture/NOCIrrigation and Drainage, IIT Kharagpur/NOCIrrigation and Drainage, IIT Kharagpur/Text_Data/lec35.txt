Exercise W 7.1:  
Which one of the foll owing is a WRONG statement? (GATE 2018)  
a) The head generated by a centrifugal pump at zero discharge is the ‘shutoff head’.  
So, if you remember the characteristic curve  the head generated by the centrifugal 
pump at  zero discharge is called a shut off head that means, when you close the 
delivery or when you close the discharge  pipe completely and then  and then ON 
the pump  and you see how much head  you can  achieve , this is shut off head . This 
is correct  
b) To avoid cavitation in centrifugal pumps, the net positive suction head should be 
more than the theoretical atmospheric pressure  
So, to avoid cavitation in centrifugal pumps the net positive suction head which is 
the minimum head required to lift water  should be more than the theoretical 
atmosphere pressure, if it is more than it is the positive pressure  so it is not going 
to suck anyway so, it should be negative pressure.  This is wrong  
 
c) According to the affinity laws of centrifuga l pumps, the head varies with the square 
of the impeller speed.  
This is true because  𝐻=𝐻1(𝑛
𝑛1)2
  
d) Most of the turbine pumps have operational characteristics closer to those of the  
centrifugal pumps than the propeller pumps  
This is correct  
Answer: b  
Exercise W7.2:  
The pump used in high pressure orchard sprayer is Plunger typ e positive displacement 
pump                             
 (Refer Slide Time: 03:40 ) 
 
Exercise W7.3:  
When the water level in a well is at a depth of 7 m from the surface, the most suitable 
pump to lift water for irrigation is   
Answe r: So, there are several pumps low head pumps , but mostly , the single stage 
centrifugal pump can operate up to  7.5 m     
Exercise W7.4:  
A pumping device that combines the advantages of both centrifugal and reciprocating 
pumps is  known as Rotary pump   
 (Refer Slide Time: 04:56 ) 
 
Exercise W7.5:  
The brake horse power of a centr ifugal pump having an impeller diameter of 200 mm is 
1.86 kW. If the impeller is replaced with another impeller of 180 mm diameter, the brake 
power of the pump in kW will be ________   (GATE 2014)  
Solution:  
Given,  
D1 = Diameter of original Impeller = 200 mm  
D = Changed diameter of Impeller = 180 mm  
P1 = BHP at D 1= 1.86 KW   
𝐷
𝐷1=√𝑃
𝑃13
 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:30 ) 
 
So, substitute  those values  
200
180=√1.86
𝑃13;                         1.11113=1.86
𝑃1 
1.11113=1.86
𝑃1;                   1.371=1.86
𝑃1 
𝑃1=1.86
1.371;                          𝑷𝟏=𝟏.𝟑𝟓 (Ans.)

Exercise W7.6:  
A six -stage centrifugal pump delivers 120 L/sec against a total head of 510 m. If the design 
speed of this pump is 1450 rpm, the  specific speed of the pump will be __________ (GATE 
2017)  
Solution:  
Given,  
𝑛 =1450 rpm  
𝑄= 120 L/ sec =  0.12 m3/s 
Total head of six stage centrifugal pump =  510 m  
𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑  = 510
6=85 
𝑛𝑠= 𝑛𝑄12⁄
𝐻34⁄ 
 
 (Refer Slide Tim e: 07:55)  
 
And if you can, if you substitute  the values  
𝑛𝑠= 1450×0.12012⁄
8534⁄ 
 
𝑛𝑠= 1450×0.3464
27.99 
 
𝑛𝑠= 502.294
27.99

Exercise W7.7:  
A 5 ha field under wheat crop is irrigated at 40% depletion of available moisture content. 
The f ield capacity, wilting point and bulk density of the soil in the field are 32% (on weight 
basis), 20% (on weight basis) and 1400 kg/m3 respectively. To irrigate the field in a day 
of 10 hours, a pump is used which lifts 270 m3 of water per hour  agains t a total head of 20 
m.  (GATE 2011)  
a. If the root zone depth is 0.8 m, the volume of water required to irrig ate the 
field in m3 will be ______  
b. The pump is driven by an electric motor. If the pump, drive and motor 
efficiencies are 80%, 82% and 90% respectively, the required size of 
electric motor in horse -power will be______  
Solution:  
Given,  
field capacity= 32%=0.32  
wilting point= 20%= 0.2  
 bulk density= 1400 kg/m3 = 1.4 g/cm3 
 (Refer Slide Time: 10:51 ) 
 
Time = 10 h  
Head = 20 m  
Pump efficiencies =80%  
Drive efficiencies =82%  
Motor efficiencies =90%

So this tutorial  is mainly , whatever we covered in the in this week  lecture , we got some 
important  questions  which are from  GATE exam  and in addition to this you can also go to 
some  other relevant books to find out the  relevant problems and sol ve yourself . With this 
the Wells and  pumps section is  done in the last 2 weeks . And from  next week onwards we 
will be focusing on drainage  part; basic principles of drainage , design of drainage and  the 
salt affected  lands . And then  what are the types of drainages , installation procedure and  
some case studies  of drainages . So, all the se things will be covering the rest of  the 5 week s 
Thank you  so much .
