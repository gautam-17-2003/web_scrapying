Lecture – 37 
Management o f Salt Affected Soil (Contd.)  
 
Friends  welcome to lecture number 37  which  is a continuation of the previous lecture that 
is on Management of Salt Affected Soils . So, in this  lecture , we are going to  solve some 
of the examples o f salt-affected soils and also at the end we are going to see  the nature of 
sodic soils and some examp les. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 00:47)  
 
Exercise 37.1:  
Irrigation water salinity (EC iw) = 1 dS/m. Applied water depth (d in) = 1176 mm/season. 
Crop water demand (ET c) = 1,000 mm/season. Assume that plants extract 40%, 30%, 20%, 
and 10% of their water from the upper quarter, 2nd quarter, 3rd quarter, and the lowest 
quarter of the root zone, respectively. First, determine the leachate salinity treating the root 
zone as a single layer. Next, determine the seepage salinity from each of the 4 layers and 
the average salinity  for the 4 layers (Ayres and Westcott, 1985).  
Solution:  
Treating the entire root zone as a single layer, calculate seepage salinity.  
 𝐿𝐹=𝑖−𝐸𝑇
𝑖=1176−1000
1176=0.15;  𝐸𝐶𝑑𝑤=𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤
𝐿𝐹=1
0.15=6.7 𝑑𝑆/𝑚 
 (Refer Slide Time: 05:36)  
 
So, let us see layer by layer , use the same equations to determine soil salinity at the bottom 
of each of the four quarters of the root zone.  
𝐿𝐹1=𝑖−𝐸𝑇
𝑖=1176−0.4∗1000
1176=0.66 
𝐸𝐶1=𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤
𝐿𝐹1=1
0.66=1.5 𝑑𝑆/𝑚 
𝐿𝐹2=776−0.3∗1000
776=0.61 
𝐸𝐶2=𝐸𝐶1
𝐿𝐹2=1.5
0.61=2.5𝑑𝑆
𝑚 
𝐿𝐹3=476−0.2∗1000
476=0.58 
𝐸𝐶3=𝐸𝐶2
𝐿𝐹3=2.5
0.58=4.3𝑑𝑆
𝑚 
𝐿𝐹4=276−0.1∗1000
276=0.64 
𝐸𝐶4=𝐸𝐶3
𝐿𝐹4=4.3
0.64=6.7𝑑𝑆
𝑚  
The calculated seepage salinities, treating the soil as a whole and in layers, agree: 6.7 dS/m.  
The average soil salinity  is the average of the irrigation water salinity and the salinities at 
the bottom of the 4 layers.  
𝐸𝐶𝑎𝑣𝑒=1

Rhoades  1974  recommended the following leaching fraction equation  for high -frequency 
sprinkler and trickle irrigations  
𝐿𝐹=𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤
2𝐸𝐶𝑒 
So, the leaching fraction for sprinkler and trickle irrigation is estimated with  electrical 
conductivity of the irrigation water (EC iw) and soil extract equivalent (EC e). 
And then, Hoffman and Van Genuchten in 1983 developed the following theoretical  
equation for LF . It has a wide range of salinity parameters for which it is accurate.  
𝐸𝐶𝑒
𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤=(1
𝐿𝐹+𝛿
𝑍∗𝐿𝐹𝑙𝑛(𝐿𝐹+(1−𝐿𝐹)𝑒−𝑧/𝛿)) 
Where Z is the root zone depth, 𝛿 is the empirical constant = 0.2*Z  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:36)  
 
The table above shows the relative salt tolerance of crops. If you look at, both annual crops 
and forage crops, the electrical conductivity which is in d S/m for non -saline to the  slightly 
saline is 0 to 4 , for moderately  saline , it is 4 to 8  and for severely saline , it is 8 to 16 . The 
different types of crops under th e annual and forage crops are given in the table along with 
their salt tolerance  category . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:19)  
 
And then  next is the irrigation app lication depth and leaching fraction ; we have talked 
about this earlie r. So, if the goal is maintaining  the salinity within an acceptable range 
during the entire growing season, the depth of irrigation water that would be applied  during 
an irrigation event i s estimated using th e following  equation . 
𝐼𝑅=100
𝐼𝐸(1−𝐿𝐹)×𝑅𝐴𝑊  
Where IR is the  irrigation requirement during a single irrigation event, cm; IE is the 
irrigation efficiency, percent.  
So, suppose you know the seasonal values and for each irrigation. So, what is irrigation 
requirements ; so, that you can maintain the salinity throughout the season. So, here 
100
(1−𝐿𝐹)×𝑅𝐴𝑊  is the readily available water and by knowing IE and LF values you can 
find out the irrigation requirement  to remove the salts.  
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:20)  
 
Example 37.2:  
Calculate the depth of irrigation water required (average for the field), IR, for melons based 
on the previous equation. The MAD is 45%, the irrigation system efficiency is 70%, the 
irrigation water EC iw is 1.09 dS/m, and the TAW is 24 cm.  
Solution:  
Max. soil salinity in the saturated paste extract (from FAO 56) for melons with no yield 
reduction = 2.2 dS/m.  
𝐿𝐹=𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤
5𝐸𝐶𝑒−𝐸𝐶𝑖𝑤=1.09
5×2.2−1.09=0.11 
𝐼𝑅=100
𝐼𝐸(1−𝐿𝐹)𝑅𝐴𝑊=100
70(1−0.11)(0.45∗24 𝑐𝑚)=17𝑐𝑚 
  (Refer Slide Time: 16:43)  
 
And then,  yield reduction due to salinity is estimated with the relative yield that is Y r in 
percentage.  
𝑌𝑟=100  × 𝐸𝐶0 − 𝐸𝐶𝑒
𝐸𝐶0 − 𝐸𝐶100 
𝑌𝑎𝑐𝑡= 𝑌𝑟 ×𝑌𝑝 
Where,  
𝐸𝐶0 = Electrical conductivity ( EC) of soil at zero yield s, dS/m  
𝐸𝐶𝑒 = EC of the soil saturation extract, dS/m  
𝐸𝐶100 = the salinity threshold level above which the crop yield starts to decline  
𝑌𝑎𝑐𝑡 = actual yield  
𝑌𝑝 = potential yield  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:08)  
 
Exercise 37.3:  
In a saline area, the EC of a wheat field during its growth period was found 7.0 dS/m. 
Estimate yield reduction due to salinity, if the wheat cultivar can maintain potential yield 
up to 4 dS/m,  and the yield at EC>22 dS/m is zero.  
Solution:  
  𝐸𝐶0 = 7 dS/m  
  𝐸𝐶𝑒 = 22 dS/m  
  𝐸𝐶100 = 4 dS/m  
  𝑌𝑟=100  × 𝐸𝐶0 − 𝐸𝐶𝑒
𝐸𝐶0 − 𝐸𝐶100;  = 100  × 22 − 7
22 − 4 = 83.33 % 
   
𝑌𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑  𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  = (100–83.33)% = 16.67%

Next , is project planning and salinity ; so, how to plan  a project  if you have a salinity issue 
in the soil ? So, irrigation water with saline water  lower than 450  mg/l and  when you divide 
it with 640 you can convert that into dS/m that is equal to 0.7 . So, to convert the  electrical 
conductivity into concentration, we need to multiply with 640, this way you get EC iw as 
0.7 dS/m , which  does not present a hazard for irrigation. Irrigation water with salinity in 
excess of 2000 mg/l  that is equivalent to EC iw 3 present s a hazar d for many crops. So, 
most of the crops are sensitive when EC is equal to 3 dS/m.  
Rao et al (1994 ) developed a table that specifies the maximum  acceptable salinity of 
irrigation water as a function of rainfall soil type and crop sensitivity to salinity.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:38)  
 
So, let us see the table  in the slide above, in this table the soil  texture is given for annual 
rainfalls  of < 350 mm ; 350 to 500 mm and 550 to 700 mm ; and crop tolerance (sensitive, 
semi -tolerance and tolerant). And for example, for fine  texture soil where  more than 30 % 
is clay for sensitive crops with an annual rainfall  of <350 mm the sensitive crops  have 1 
dS/m  maximum tolerance, semi tolerant crops  can grow up to 1.5 dS/m , and tolerant crop 
up to 2 dS/m . So, like that  the maxim um acceptable salinity in irrigation water as a function 
of soil type rainfall and crops sensitivity to salinity  can be known.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 22:45)  
 
So next is the sodicity , so in salinity , we target  for any salts , salts in the sense sodium , 
calcium , potassium , magnesium , etc. So, combining  all the salts , but in some places , if 
sodium  percentage is more we call it sodicity  so, we are targeting the sodium. Excess 
sodium reduces water availability . If you see this picture  above , the clay  particles  are 
negatively charged and sodium is positively charged and sodium has single valence  
compared to calcium  so, calcium will attach strongly to clay particles as compared to 
sodium particles that is why in order to  show its activity the sodium  having  aroun d 10 
hydration bonds created around the sodium molecule . So, in that case, whatever the 
amount of water available will be absorbed  to the sodium and that hydrostatic pressure 
will be created that will push the clay layers away . So, that is why, water avail ability in  
case of sodicity will be less  and it leads to the breakdown of clay particles  because when 
the sodium molecules absorb a lot of water, it bulges , and then it pushes the  clay bonds 
away that is why the structure is going to  dismantle.  So, then the clay  particle can clog the 
soil and reduce the infiltration rate  to nearly 0.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:46)  
 
Next is calcium , as stated earlier it is  attracted more strongly to the clay particles because 
its valence is 2  so, it attracts stronger than sodium , if too many sodium molecules with 
their large shell of hydration , force the clay  particles apart and breakdown the soil 
structure.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 26:46)  
 
Sodicity is expressed with sodium adsorption ratio (SAR )  
𝑺𝑨𝑹=|𝑵𝒂+|
√|𝑪𝒂++|+|𝑴𝒈++|
𝟐 
Where Na+ is the sodium normality, meq/L; Ca++ is the calcium normality, meq/L; Mg++ 
is the magnesium normality, meq/L.  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:20)  
 
The table  above  shows the sodicity hazard to soil as a function of irrigation water sodicity 
and salinity. So, kno wing  the SAR  by using th e previous  equation  and knowing the salinity 
of irrigation water  EC iw we can  see whether the particular environment is hazardous or 
not. So,  for eg.  SAR values from 0 to 3 and EC iw greater than 0.7 dS/m will be non -
hazardous . This table very important  because  the sodium hazard level i s a function of both 
SAR and overall salinity . Higher salinity in the soil water decreases the osmotic potential  
of water in the soil water solution and  as such decreases the amount of water in the  
hydration shells around the sodium ions in the interlayer between the clay particles.  So it 
will be very difficult for the plants  to absorb water. Thus it may be very  detrimental to 
irrigate with low salinity water in the field that was previously irrigat ed with high salinity 
and sodicity water  
(Refer Slide Time: 29:02)  
 
Let us go through an example,  
Example 37.4:  
Irrigation water has 460 mg/L sodium (Na+), 40.1 mg/L calcium (Ca++), and 24.3 mg/L 
magnesium (Mg++). If irrigation water salinity is 1,280 ppm, then what level of hazard is 
presented by sodicity?  
Solution:  
Calculate meq/L for each cation.

𝟐=𝟕 
The EC iw of the irrigation water is 1,280 ppm/640 = 2 dS/m.  
So, let us go back and check whether it is hazardous or not.  
From the Table (previous slide), there is no possible hazard due to sodicity from this water.  
(Refer Slide Time: 31:44)  
 
Next is the salinity management options ; the first one is the remov al of surface salts. So, 
if you see the white scum or white layer on top of the  soil, one practice  is to just scrap  
away the  salts from the surface  or you can also  do surface flushing  by using high jet  water 
to flush the salt 's surface . The other method is the control  of saline water , if you have a lot 
of salts present on the  surface you can use the drainage system to remove the salts from 
there.  
And then, there are engineering practices like leaching  as studie d earlier, the leaching 
fraction and also drainage . We are going to  study drainage  exclusively from the next 
lecture . Artificial recharge of rainwater to the aquifer through a recharge well can also  be 
used to remove  the salts . Irrigation and w ater management practices are onsite  
management , if we have lot s of salt in the irrigation water  you can take care of  it by treating 
the water before use or you can  go for crop management  by growing  crops that are 
susceptible or tolerant to the particul ar irrigation  salinity levels.  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:18)  
 
One of the engineering practices for salinity management is  leaching. It consists  of 
applying enough good quality water  to thoroughly leach excess salts from the soil. It can 
be done  in two ways ; leaching requirement  method and leaching plus artificial drainage . 
Leaching requirement - the salts can be moved below the root by applying more water than 
the plant needs, that is what we  estimated previously . The leachate requirement is extra 
water  need ed to leach the salts .  
Leachate plus artificial drainage  - in some cases  if you have a very shallow root zone , even 
if you add more water on top of the soil  it cannot flush the salts because of the  clay layer 
in the  bottom. So, there you have to use  in addition to the leachate artificial drainage to 
remove the  extra salts from the root zone.  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 34:26)  
 
Next is the drainage ; so, the drainage system is provide d where the  subsoil is not permeable  
because the amount of water that is pouring on top will cause water logging.  We will talk 
about drainage in the following lectures . It could be surface drainage  i.e., by making 
ditches on the surface and removin g the extra water from the surface . Subsurface drainage , 
if you have both surface s as we ll as water from the root zone and you want to remove  both 
then you can use subsurface drainage by  providing deep ditches or tiles . Mole drainage , in 
some cases, the  clay soils causes a lot of water ponding or water logging condition. So, 
ordinary  machiner y cannot be used to make ditches, that is why  a kind of a mole plough 
will be used to remove the shallow channels , and through that , the water will be  remove d. 
Vertical drainage is  a kind of  removing water vertically through  tube-wells . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 35:55)  
 
Then the other one is the artificial recharge of excess rain water to  the aquifer t hrough  a 
recharge well. If you see the recharge well  as shown in the image above there are  
perforation s to the  well through the pipe . And on top of it, there  is a recharge pit . The 
recharge well is lined  in such a way with coarse sand , gravel , pebbles , etc. as shown in the 
picture above s o, water will be  entering through these and finally, through the perforations , 
it will be going into the  soil and the rest extra water can also penetrate through th e side of 
the well  and there is clean  water again. So, this way the  salinity of the aquifer will  be lower 
due to dilution and become within an acceptable  range . If we add good  water on top that  
will dilute the salts present in the  soil. The shallow depth recharge structures with tube 
wells  are often a better choice than the surface storage in flat topography with good aquifer 
properties.  
So, thi s is all about this  lecture, mostly we focused on overall salinity and then the sodic  
soils or sodicity. Sodicity  means containing more  sodium ions compared to other salts. 
Generally,  sodicity is measure d with SAR sodium absorption ratio then knowing the 
sodium adsorption ratio and overall salinity you can find out whether that particular 
condition is hazardous for the crop or not.  
Thank you.
