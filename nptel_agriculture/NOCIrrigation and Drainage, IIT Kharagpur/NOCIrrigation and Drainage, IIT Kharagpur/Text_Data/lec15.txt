Lecture – 15 
Tutorial  
 
Friends  welcome to lecture number 15; this is week  3 so at the end of every week as  I said 
we are going to  discuss some tutorial problems . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:37)  
 
So before going to the tutorial,  in the previous  lecture we have learn about the water  
measuring devices  and you clearly  see some head  differences , that difference could be due 
to the friction loss or some other bends  or some abstractions , so how to estimate that head  
differences ? Mostly the head  loss is due to friction or due to entrance  losses , due to bends  
or head due to expansion  or contraction  etc. The major head  loss is mostly due to  the 
friction  so for estimating friction  loss we have  two equations  Darcy -Weisbach equation  
and Chezy ’s formula . So head  loss according to the Darcy -Weisbach  formula  is as follows:  
ℎ𝑓= 4×𝑓×𝐿×𝑣2
2×𝑑×𝑔 
Where 𝑓= 16
𝑅𝑒 for 𝑅𝑒<2000 (viscous flow)  or 𝑓= 0.079
𝑅𝑒1
4 for 𝑅𝑒 varying from 4000 to 106 
Chezy’s formula  is:  
𝑉=𝐶√𝑚𝑖 
Where 𝑚=𝐴
𝑃, 𝑖=ℎ𝑓
𝐿; ℎ𝑓=loss of head due to friction, 𝑓=co-efficient of friction which is 
function of Reynolds number, 𝐿=length of pipe, 𝑣=mean velocity of flow, 𝑑=diameter of 
pipe, 𝑔=acceleration due to gravity, 𝐴=area of cross -section of pipe, 𝑃=wetted perimeter 
of pipe, 𝐶=chezy’s constant, 𝑖=loss of  head per unit length of pipe.  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:51)  
 
There are some  minor head losses  also which  is due to the foll owing : 
Sudden expansion of pipe  
ℎ𝑒=(𝑉1−𝑉2)2
2𝑔 
Sudden contraction of pipe  
ℎ𝑐=0.5𝑉22
2𝑔 
Entrance of pipe or exit of pipe  
ℎ𝑖=0.5𝑉2
2𝑔 or ℎ𝑜=0.5𝑉2
2𝑔 
An obstruction in pipe  
ℎ𝑜𝑏=𝑉2
2𝑔 (𝐴
𝐶𝑐(𝐴−𝑎)−1)2
 
Bend in pipe  
ℎ𝑏=𝑘𝑉2
2𝑔 
So the above equation s can be used to find out the minor head losses  and you can also get 
this minor head losses using the table which will be  discussed  in future  lectures  where we 
will use a  nomograph ; and for a particular shape or particular  bend you can find out the 
friction head loss for 100 meter  lengt h of the pipe .  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:08)  
 
So, let us solve  example  
Exercise W3.1: Find the head loss due to friction in a pipe of diameter 300 mm and length 
50m, through which water is flowing at a velocity of 3 m/s using i) Darcy formula and ii) 
Chezy’s formula for which C= 60. Take kinematic viscosity ( μ)for water =0.01 stoke.  
Solution:  
d= 300 mm = 0.30 m, L=50 m, v =3 m/s, C = 60, μ =0.01 stoke = 0.01 cm2/s = 0.01×10-4

So these are some of the  examples  which are  given in the competitive examinations like 
GATE.  So, you can also try  few more examples in other textbo oks mentioned as reference 
books . In this tutorial we focus ed the questions which are  on the basis of the water  
measuring  structures . Initially we started with  some head losses  - friction head losses and 
how to estimate  major head loss and minor head losses  like bends , enlargement , exit. 
So, in the next lecture  we will be focusing on surface irrigation methods  sprinkler , drip 
irrigation and those  the basic principles and then design principles and the work out 
examples in the next  coming in the  2 weeks . 
Thank you  so much .
