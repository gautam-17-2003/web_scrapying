Soil properties - 1 
Hello friends welcome back  to lecture number 2 of Irrigation and Drainage  lecture series . In 
this lecture we will be focusing on  soil properties because,  it is the core of learning in irrigation 
and also drainage principles , that is why we need to understand the basic  of soil properties .  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:54)  
 
The first  figure  above (slide1)  shows the hydrologic cycle,  if you see here water is the main 
connection between soil , plant and atmosphere;  and it acts as  a continuum. In the hydrological 
cycle, initially the water is going to evaporate from sea or any water a body, then  it is going to 
condense in the atmosphere,  and then the condens ed water is going to form clouds, and 
precipitated down as rainfall . Once it is falling on the surface , some part of the precipitation 
goes as over land flow  or run-off the other part will inf iltrate down into this soil and then 
percolates into  the d ifferent soil layers , meeting the groundwater and the base flow . Some 
water may travel as  sub-surface flow to the streams and finally it may go into the rivers or 
ocean or any other water bodies.  Some portion of the water is transpired from the plant surface 
to the atmosphere. So, if you observed  all these , the water is basically connecting the soil , plant 
and also the atmosphere. The second figure above (slide1)  is an  elaborate view of both 
evaporat ions from the surface as  well as plant body  i.e., evapotranspiration . Also precipitation 
as input to the system  where  some  of its  portion goes into the ground water.  The soil water is 
the unsaturated flow  and the soil which is on the surface will have the soil water which  is 
basically important  because plants  absorbed  or a takes the soil water  for its function . So, this 
is the main components of hydrological cycle  from irrigation point of view . 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:40)  
 
Soil is a three phase system;  we can see in the first image above the enlarged view of the part 
of the soil c olumn’s cross -section. You can see the solid  part which is the soil  particles and also 
there is some space between these soil particles  that is filled with the liquid phase and also the 
gaseous phase , that is why the soil is  a three phase system, water air and solid. Solid will have 
the minerals and organic matter, and also other chemical compounds ; whereas the liquid phase 
is mostly the soil moisture, but also we can see the dissolve  chemicals which is the liquid form 
with in the soil moisture and also we can see the gaseous chemicals.  So, the whole entity is 50% 
solid portion and remaining 50 % is 25% air and 25% water , the solid s has 47 % minerals and 
3% organic matter.  
(Refer Slide T ime: 05:42)  
 
A typical soil profile is shown in  the figure above, if you take a look down into the soil and 
make a cross section al view, it will have different horizons or layers. The first layer is the O 
horizon, which is primarily composed of organic ma tter, because on the surface there will be 
lot of lit ter and plant material which is accumulating over a period of time, that will have 
composed  or decomposed into organic forms. The next layer is the A horizon  which is the 
surface  so, the surface will hav e organic matter (OM) mixes with inorganic products of 
weathering.  The next layer is the subsoil  layer  which have fine material accumulated and 
enriched with calcium carbonate and also the fine material. The last layer which is  the parent 
material is  the substratum, this parent material generally remains  in the soil for centuries  and 
over the substratum  other soil formation slowly has  been tak ing place  which is the bedrock, it 
is the lying support to the entire  soil layers , then below the bedrock there are aquifers or some 
other layers or it  can repeat the same layers.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:08)  
 
Next is the soil properties , the first propert y we are going to study  is the soil texture. Soil 
texture is the relative proportion of various sizes of individual s oil particles.  When  you ta ke a 
portion of soil in your hand, you will see that the soil particles are not  of the same size , so the 
combination of different  proportion of these different size of soil particles will give the soil 
texture.  
If you see th e abov e picture  closely  you can see soil particles of different size , a little portion 
of the soil is expose  or enhance , and you can see  the different  size of  the soil particle s. If the 
particle is having 0.05 to 2 mm  size, we call it sand. And if you take  some other soil which has  
particles size of 0.002  mm to 0.05 mm , it is called silt, and if the soil particles size is less than 
0.002 mm , it is call ed clay.  These sizes  are based on the USDA  (United States Department of 
Agriculture) classification .  
Texture may  be modified by changing the concentration of organic matter content, clay 
minerals and then associated ions. Suppose you have  soil with 60%  the sand  content and in 
course of time you have added manure or some clay content , that will definitely change the 
size, and some of the sand content may decrease and the fine r material  percentage  will increase. 
So, that is why the texture may vary with the addition of organic matter and the clay contents 
or other minerals.  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:34)  
 
Generally,  textur e is a represented with  a textural triangle  as shown in image above,  which is 
an equilateral triangle ; and its three sides represents the percentage  of sand , clay and  silt. 
Suppose you have  a soil with  60% sand, silt 30 % and clay 10 %. Using th e textural triangle,  it 
will help you to identify the textural type.  Basically the textural triangle shows  coarse verses 
fine and light verses heavy  soil, you can clearly visualize this triangle based on the sand silt 
and clay content.  
Soil texture definitely affect t he water movement and the storage.  For example,  coarse textural 
particle sizes are larger partic les size and they will have larger pore spaces , that will help the 
water movement really easy /faster as compare to smaller  particles.  If you have tiny pores that 
means your sand content is less and your silt and clay content are more, so definitely that is 
going to influence your water movements  and the water movement is going to be slower.   
Next is how do you determine the soil texture.  For example,  what  happens  to storage in clay 
soils? Clay soils holds water and it does not transmit water  that is why it can store more water .  
 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 14:20)  
 
As a said earlier,  we are going  to see an example  to determin e the soil texture using the textural 
triangl e. So, supposed  soil contains  60% sand, 25% silt and 15% clay and you want  to find out 
what  is that soil textural  class.  In the USDA  textural  triangle,  the sand content of  60% is 
selected and a line is drawn in the direction  of the 60 % line, from the silt side 25 % is selected  
and a line is draw n parallel  to the 20% line and this going  to meet the 60% sandy line.  Then 
clay of 15 % line is selected and a line also is drawn  parallel to the 10% line until it joined  the 
cross  section  of sand and silt, resulting  in a sandy  loam  soil. In this example  the textural  class 
of 60 % sand,  20% silt and 15% clay falls under  sandy  loam  class .  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:50)  
 
Next is how to analyze  this soil textural,  i.e., how to get the percentage  of sand, silt and clay, 
this is important  for obtaining soil textural class . So for a given  soil how do we measure  
percentage  of sand,  silt and clay and when  you know these  you can  use the textural triangle  to 
find out which  class  the soil belong  to. There are few commonly  used methods  first is a sieve  
method , and second  is the sedimentation  method.  The sieve  method  is mostly  applicable  to 
particle  size or sand size more  than 0.05 mm. And sedimentation  method  is used for 
determining  particle  size finer  than 0.05 mm. It can be  conducted u sing pipette  method  or 
hydrometer  method.  So, let us see the methods  one by one.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:10)  
 
In the textural  analysis  by using  sieve  method , different  sieves  of standard  sizes  are used as 
shown in the picture  above  (slide 8) . The sieves ar e arrange d on the basis  of the mesh size or 
opening size , with the sieve having the larger mesh size or bigger opening at the top most, then 
followed by the smaller sizes  subsequently and  it will form a stack  of sieves.  For example the 
sieve  maybe  having  2 mm size dia. or aperture  followed by 1 mm, 500 micron 300  micro 
meters sieve  and 75 micro  meters  and at the end is a pan where the size finer than 75 
micrometers will be collected . Aperture is the number of openings per unit square inch.  After 
arranging t he stack of sieves,  200 grams  of soil sample  is kept on the topmost  sieve  and the 
stack is kept for shaking in a sieve  shaker.  Then  after 4 to 5 minutes  of sieving  or shaking, the  
soil samples retained on each sieve and also the pan were collect ed and weig ht to find out the 
percentage  of retention  and percentage  finer.  
A graph is  drawn  between  size and percentage  finer and then the effective  size and  coefficient  
of uniformity  is determined . And finally  our main  objective  is to find out the percentage  of 
sand, silt and clay.  
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 22:00)  
 
To find out the percentage  retained  in each  sieve  the amount  retained  is divided  by the total 
amount  and multipl y with 100. For percentage finer  the cumulative  of the weight retained is 
subtract ed from the 100 percent . Suppose 30 grams  of material  is left on a 2 mm sieve  that 
means  30 gram  of material  will have this size more  than 2 mm. For example,  50 grams  of 
material  is kept on top and 30 grams  is left that means  20 grams past  over a partic ular sieve  
which  will be calculated  as percentage  finer.  
A sinusoidal  graph  between  grain  size (diameter)  and percentage  of passing is  drawn (slide 9).  
To find the coefficient  of uniformity which is equal to D60 by D 10. First we have to find D 60 
that means,  60% of materi al passing  a sieve , a line is drawn from the 60% passing  crossing  the 
curve  and the corresponding  diameter  is obtained from the x -axis. In the same  way we are 
going to  find D10, where D10 is effective  size. The coefficient  of uniformity  that is D60 by D 10 
is 3.9  in the above example . To find out what  is the percentage  of sand, silt and clay you have 
to use the USDA  class . You can find out the percentage  of passing  and that  will that will give 
the size and knowing  the size you can calculate the percentages  of sand silt and clay  in sieve  
analysis.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 26:45)  
 
Next is the textural  analysis  by pipette  method . The materials required are  a pipette  and 
measuring  jars/measuring  cylinders.  Take  20 grams  of soil sample  add 5 ml of sodium  
hexamet aphosphate,  which  is a dispersing  agent. DI water  is added  and the solution is blended  
for 5 minutes,  and then pour into a 1000 ml  measuring  cylinder  and make up with DI water  up 
to 1000 ml. After  5 minutes  and after 5 hours  a known volume of sample is tak en out from the 
measuring cylinder and the dry weight  of the sample  were obtained , with these  2 measurements  
we can estimate  percentage  of silts, sand and clay.   
(Refer  Slide  Time: 28:37)  
 
Suppose we are taking here 0.25 ml volume of solution each time of a particular soil specimen .  
At 5 minutes’  time the dry weight  of the sample  is 0.16 g and at 5 hours the sample  dry weight  
is 0.09 g. So, the percentage  of silt and clay particles  is estimated  as  
𝑆𝑖𝑙𝑡 +𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑦  (%)=  𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝 𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑡 5 𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙   ×𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙  𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒  𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛  ×𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  
So, here the total volume  is 1000 ml and volume  of sample  is 0.25 ml and weight  of dry sample  
at 5 minute  is 0.16 g and weight  of soil is 20 g. So, all together   
𝑆𝑖𝑙𝑡 +𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑦  (%)=  0.16
20  ×0.25  ×1000 =32%  
Similarly, for clay the percentage  is  
𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑦  (%)=  𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒  𝑎𝑡 5 ℎ
𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔 ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙   ×𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙  𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒  𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛  ×𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒  
𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑦  (%)=  0.09
20  ×0.25  ×1000 =17.55%  
So, subtracting   
𝑆𝑖𝑙𝑡 %= 𝑆𝑖𝑙𝑡 +𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑦  (%)−𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑦  (%)= 32−17.55=14.55%     
14.55% is the percentage  of the silt and you already have  percentage of clay, and knowing  
the total (100%)  you can find out the percentage  of sand particle.   
𝑆𝑎𝑛𝑑  (%)= 100 − 17.55+14.55=68%  
So, this way we can find out percentage  of silt, sand and clay from the pipette  method.   
(Refer  Slide  Time: 30:42)  
 
Next  we are going  to see the other  method called hydrometer  method.  The hydrometer  is 
basically  used for measuring  the specific gravity  of water  in any material. As shown in slide 
above, 50 grams  of soil is sieved  and weight  through a  2 mm size  sieve . And then the  soil is 
mixed with DI water ( DI water acts as dispersing  agent ) in a blender  for 5 minutes,  then add 
that mix to a 1000 ml measuring cylinder make up the volume to 1000 ml using DI water.  Then 
the hydrometer  is inserted  in to the solution,  at 40 seconds  and 20 minutes  standing time of  the 
solution . Hydrometer  will give density readings  and it has been  calibrated  for different  amount  
of the concentration  of solutions.  The hydrometer  method  and the previous  pipette  method  
work based  on the Stokes  law. Stokes  law basically  measured  the speed of particles  like heavier  
particles  verses  lighter  particles.  The velocity  of fall depends  on the size of the particle . so 
based  on that the settling  velocity , settling  time and  the particle diameter  can be calculated  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 32:47)  
 
For ex ample, the initial  mass  M1 of soil sample is 50 g/l. The 40 sec of hydrometer  reading  
indicat e that immediately  the sand is going  to settle  and whatever  the particles  which  are in the 
suspension  in forty seconds  are silt and clay so, that is M2 suppose  and it is 30 g/l. At 20 
minutes’  time silt is going to  settle and  only clay is  under  suspension  so that is  M3 which is 10 
g/l so that gives  this amount of clay. So, M 1 minus  M2 will gave 20 g/l which represent the 
amount of sand . The sand and clay amount is a dded and subtracted from  the total amount 
which is 50 grams  so that will give the silt which is 20 g/l . And then knowing  the total amount,  
you can estimate  the individual  percentages.  So, this way you can measured  the soil percentage  
of sand,  silt, clay using hydrometer.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 34:23)  
 
Next is a very easy method  you can do at home;  this is given  by RELMA . (Regional  Land  
Management  Unit World Agroforestry  Center  2005). In this method the only thing required  is 
a plastic  bottle , filled the bottle with soil up to one third of the volume,  and then add water to  
another  one third. And  then shake  the bottle  well and leave  it for 4 hours.  Then find out the 
settlings  depth  of different layers formed  whatever  settles  at the bottom  will be gravel and the 
next layer  is the sand and next layer  is the silt and  next layer  is the clay. So, knowing  the depths  
of settlement  so you can find out the percentage  of clay, silt, sand  and then gravel.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 35:37)  
 
The soil textural  classification, as  mentioned  earlier  is given  by USDA  and then there  is an 
international  society  of soils science  (ISSS ). The table in slide  above  shows USDA  and ISSS 
class ification of soil texture . Gravel  size is greater  than 2 mm for both classificat ion and clay 
will have  less than 0.002 .  
In this class  what  we learn  today  is the importan ce of water  which  connects  basically  the soil, 
plant  and atmosphere  and the hydrologic  cycle ; what constitutes  soil and soil properties  like 
soil texture  its measur ement, knowing the soil texture from percentage of silt , sand and clay 
using textural triangle, and identifying the particular soil textural class ; sieve analysis  for 
estimating  percentage  of silt, sand and clay and also t wo methods  which  worked  on Stokes law 
i.e., pipette  method  and hydrometer  method . In the next class  we are going  to study other  soil 
property  like soil structure,  bulk density, the particle  density  and other  things .
