Drip Irrigation -I 
This is  a lecture number  23 on Drip Irrigation , in this lecture we will be  learning how to 
design a drip irrigation system . In the previous  lectures we have been talking  about  
sprinkler irrigation  system , in the sprinkler , the discharge  is more than that of drip 
irrigation since we are applying  water drop by drop  through an  emitter  in drip irrigation . 
The sprinkler s are be ing replaced  with drippers and the lateral s and main s are replaced 
with tiny pipes . Since the water has to pass through small er diameter pipes and smaller  
openings , the water should be as clean as possible  compared t o even  sprinkler irrigation . 
So, we have some extra filtration  units in case of  drip irrigation , but design -wise they are 
almost similar . We are going to see some additional component s and use some of the 
calculation  methods  from  sprinkler  design , . 
(Refer  Slide Time: 01:56 ) 
 
Drip irrigation  layout is shown in the picture  above,  it has a water source and from the 
water source , it pa sses through  a sand separator or cyclone filter , where the heavier 
particles or sand particles are going to settle down or sep arated and  then the  clean water 
goes into the  sand filter . Most of the bacteria , even the clay particles are going to be 
separated in the sand filter a nd from there , there  is a screen filter  and then  the water passes 
through the mainline or sub-main . Each lateral will have d rippers at definite  intervals  and 
there is  an air valve  to release a ir present in the  system  and there is an  end stop  to stop the 
water  from coming out at the end of the tine pipes . So, the sprinkler s are be ing replaced 
with the drippers , otherwise , it is almost similar . 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:32 ) 
 
Next is the types of drip systems, there are different kinds  of drip irrigation systems . On-
line emitter or  dripper  system  is one type. The drippers are fixed  externally on the lateral  
at the designed  spacing . Different  drippers are shown in the slide above ,  the drippers are 
colored based on the discharge  from each  the dripper . For example, here the black one has 
2 lph, the blue one has 4 lph , the yellow one is 8 lph and the green one  is 8 lph. This 
arrangement  based on the color will make it easier for the f armer  while using it. T he 
dripper spacing can b e change d at any time by taking the emitter  out and  putting it in other 
spacing  based on the time of the plant grow th period. On-line emitters are commonly used  
for horticultural  crops like  mango , coconut , citrus , oranges , lemon , bananas , etc.  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:15 ) 
 
The n ext one is the emit ting pipe system  or the in -line drip  system , here the dripper  is 
present inside the pipe . In a pipe or lateral  tape, the dripper is present inside  and the water 
pass from the opening  of the dripper inside  and slowly take s the long path , and finally, it 
comes out . The drippers in this system are fixed and once installed you cannot  change 
during the  growing season. It is very effective for row crops like cotton , sugarcane , 
groundnut , vegetables and floriculture  because the problem of blockages and  rodent s effect  
in the field will be reduced  if you use this  in-line system .  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:37 ) 
 
And then  next is  the point source emitters , it can be classified as  the long path , orifice , and 
pressure compensating . The point source emitters are shown in the picture above a nd there 
are another  called line so urce emitters.  
The classificat ion of emitters depends  on th e equation  
𝑄=𝑘𝑝𝑥 
Where  Q is the emitter discharge in lps, P is the operating pressure in kpa, k and x are the  
constant s for the specified  emitter .  
Based on the x value you decide the emitter  type. If x = 1 it represents a laminar flow 
emitter , if x = 0.5 it is an orifice type emitter , or if x = 0 then that is a pressure compensating  
emitter.  In this equation  when  x = 0  we get Q = k; that means, there is no pressure effect 
on the discharge  hence it is pressure compensating . Where as in a line source you have a 
tape or tubing and emitter s are present as openings , it could be seen in the image above.   
(Refer Slide Time: 08:30 ) 
 
A graph is shown in the slide above, the pressure is in the x -axis and the emitter discharge  
on the y -axis. Curves for  different kind s of emitters at different k and x value s are shown 
in the graph . So from this chart , you can select  discharge by knowing the k and x value s. 
For example, at a pressure  head of 300 kpa for orifice type  emitter , I am getting a  discharge 
of about 18 lph. T his graph is very useful  for knowing the  pressure , and the type of emitter 
and the corresponding  discharge , . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:40 ) 
 
The line source  emitters could be a porous pipe or tape that  discharge s water along its 
entire  length . The images in the above slide show  the line source  emitter with  openings , in 
the porous pipe  water can simply  emit through a small opening  and the discharge could be 
along the line. I t is primarily used for row crops , sometimes you see the  bubblers 
discharging into the furrows . The line source emitters  could be mono -walled  or bi-walled  
(twin wall). In the bi -walled , the pipe has two layers and the water initial come out through  
the openings of the inner layer (as shown in the image above) and it is taking a long path  
to come out  from the inner walled to the outer walled  so the flow rate is then reduce d 
because instead of  discharging immediately  it is taking some  time in the second wall and 
releasing it reduce the discharge further . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:06 ) 
 
Next is the drip  irrigation later als. Lateral s deliver  water from main line and sub -mains  to 
the emissio n devices ; it is a kind of a conveyance  system from the water  source  to the 
emitter devices. A nd the materials used are gener ally polyethylene and  PVC . The diameter 
of the  point source emitters  could be  10 to 20 mm and for line  source emitters i ts more 
than 20 mm because you have to accommodate  the emitters inside the pipe. A nd lateral s 
are designed to maintain acceptable variation of emission devic e discharge along their  
length . The manufacturer 's coefficient of variation  (Cv) determines the acceptability , if the 
coefficient of variation  is close to your manufacture s Cv when you test that in the field then 
it is working well  or it is acceptable . 
The Cv is determined  from flow rate measurements for several identical emission devices 
and is computed with the following e quation.  
𝐶𝑣= (𝑞12+𝑞22+.……….+𝑞12−𝑛𝑞−2)12⁄
𝑞̅(𝑛−1)12⁄ 
Where, 𝐶𝑣 = manufacturer' coefficient of va riation  
q1, q2……. q n =discharge of emission device, l/hr  
q̅ = Average discharge of emission devices tested, l/hr  
n= number of emission devices tested  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:33 ) 
 
The American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE ) now known as the American 
Society of Agricultural Biological Engineers (ASABE ) has recommended  the Cv value 
ranges and  classification  as shown in the table in the slide above. So when you buy the 
emitter , you have to test it in the field and find out  the Cv and compare it with the  
manufacture rs and compared with the  table  above  then you will know whether the emitter 
is work ing well or not . 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:01 ) 
 
Next is the emission  uniformity  EU which is given as follows  
𝐸𝑈=100 (1−1.27
√𝑁𝑒 (𝐶𝑣))𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑄avg 
Where,  
𝐸𝑈= design emission uniformity, %  
𝑁𝑒= Number of point source emitters per emission point  
𝐶𝑣  = Manufacture’s coefficient of variation  
𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛=minimum emitter discharge rate in the system, L/h  
𝑄𝑎𝑣𝑔 = average or design emitt er discharge rate, L/h  
 (Refer Slide Time: 16:10 ) 
 
The slide above presents the table of  recommended ranges of design emission uniformity  
Permanent crops are like the orchard  crops , once it  is installed  it remains for  10-15 years . 
Line source emitters  are used on annual row crops , for example, vegetab le crops . In the 
table , ‘a’ means  spaced  > 4 m and ‘b’ indicate  spacing < 2 m. The t opography is also 
important  to determine the type of emitters.  ‘c’ indicate slope <  2 % uniform slope an d ‘d’ 
is for slope > 2 % that is an undulating slope  or steep s lope. You ca n see the  EU range for 
arid areas is 90 to 95 % in case of point source emitter crops that are greater than  4 m 
spacing and less than 2 %. 
Similarly, you can find out the line source emitter s on ann ual crops for less than 2% slope 
and you can achieve  80 to 90%. This table is very important  to know the emission 
uniformity  of emitter type and soil topography .  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:58 ) 
 
For example : For the given data, compute the emission uniformity for drip lateral for an 
arid region and check whether the design is acceptable  
Point source emitters on a permanent crop  
Cv = 0.07  
Qmin = 30 lph  
Qavg =33 lph  
Ne =1 
Uniform terrain with slopes less than 2%.  
Solution:  
EU=100  (1−1.27
√Ne (Cv))Qmin
Q𝑎𝑣𝑔 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:45 ) 
 
Then substitute all the values in the above equation  
𝐸𝑈=100 (1−1.27
√𝑁𝑒 (𝐶𝑣))𝑄𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑄avg  =100(1−1.27
√1 (0.07))30
33 
                          =82.8% 
If you go back to the table ,  for this particular emitter  the criteria are we ar e expecting is 
90% of emission uniformity , but you get  82.8 % emission uniformity . 
So, how to increase emission uniformity ? 
EU in the example could be improved by  
 increasing Ne  
 using an emitter with a  lower Cv  
 reducing the difference between Qmin and Qavg  
 using the larger diameter and/or shorter laterals  
 using pressure compensating emitters  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:30 ) 
 
The slide above presents two plots the first plot have the number of emitters  Ne in the x-
axis and emission uniformity  in the y -axis. You can see the  different  Cv values  in the plot  
and as the  EU is increasing you have to increase the number of  drippers to get more 
emission uniformity  or otherwise , for a fixed number of  Ne the lower  Cv will have higher 
emission u niformity . 
The next plot  in the slide above shows  the exponent  x in this equation  q = kpx in the x -axis 
and the EU on the y -axis. Here the EU is high for  emitters with lower x , the EU is showing 
a decreasing  trend , and the different Cv values are represented i n the plot. F or example,  x 
is  0.5, which  is the orifice type , so for orifice  type emitter  as Cv is decreasing the EU is 
going to increase .  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:40 ) 
 
Next is the pressure variation along a pipeline , this is important to find out  the pump 
capacity or pump power The pressure variation in the pipe is 
𝑃𝑑= 𝑝𝑢−𝐾(h1±∆𝑍) 
Where,  
Pd, pu = Pressure at downstream and upstream positions, Kpa  
h1= Energy loss in the pipe, m  
∆Z=Elevation difference, m (+ ve for uphill)  
K = 9.81  
h1=FH1+M1 
Where,  
F = constant; f (number of outlets and meth od used to estimate H 1) 
H1 = friction loss, m  
M1 = minor losses through fitting (from standard Tables)  
F is a friction factor or  constant , this we can estimate by using  the procedure  we have seen 
in sprinkler irrigation  in the previous lecture .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 24:40 ) 
 
Let us see how to estimate h 1,  we use the 3 equations Darcy Weisbach , Hazen W illams, 
and Scobey then  
𝐻1=𝐾𝐶𝐿𝑄𝑚
𝐷2𝑚+𝑛 
Where,  K = friction factor  that depends on pipe material; L = Length of pipe, m ; Q = 
Discharge, l/min ; D = Diameter of pipe, mm ; C, m and n= Constants   
For trickle, Darcy -Weisbach Equation is preferred. The constants c, m and n  
 for D -W are 277778, 2.0 &1.0  
 for H -W    591722, 1.85 & 1.17  
 for Scobey     610042, 1.90 & 1.10  
 (Refer Slide Time: 25:48 ) 
 
Next is how to estimate K value  
 K is given by (For D -W)                              𝐾=0.811(𝑓
𝑔) 
Where,  
𝑓 = friction factor from the moody diagram ; g is the acceleration due to gravity  
Knowing the Reynolds number ( NR), 
For N R less than 2000 (laminar flow)   𝑓=64
𝑁𝑅 
For N R between than 2000 and 100000 (turbulent flow)  𝑓=0.32𝑁𝑅−0.25 
For N R greater than 100000 (Fully turbulent flow)  𝑓=0.80+2 log(𝑁𝑅
√𝑓) 
By knowing NR you can estimate small f , and then finally  the K value . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:40 ) 
 
In the slide above,  if you look at the  point source emitters  image at the diameter of the 
lateral a point source  emitter  is insert ed the emitter  will have  a barb  in it to push  the emitter.  
The water has to pass through these  barbs and the flowing water which has an abstraction 
in the pipe  is going to have an additional head los s.  
How to estima te the head loss due to th ese barbs , in the graph  above it clearly show the 
inside diameter of the lateral  in the x -axis and the emitter  connection loss equivalent  (CL) 
in the y -axis. T he pipe the losses will be estimated in terms of equivalent pipe lengths  this 
is multiplied by the number of  barbs  added to L in Darcy W eisbach , Hazen - Willams or 
Scobey Equation; 𝐻1=𝐾𝐶𝐿𝑄𝑚
𝐷2𝑚+𝑛 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:23 ) 
 
Here the length L is the  pipe length , which include s the lateral  length as well as the  friction 
head loss due to barbs . How do we  convert that into length units  of the barb ? For example , 
L1 is the length of the lateral , L2 is the equivalent  pipe length due to barbs . 
L2 will be estimated from the  graph  above, you  can see in the graph  that knowing  the inside 
diameter of  the pipe , you can estimate the C L. You can directly use this graph to get the 
CL value,  or you can use  the equation shown in the graph . Knowin g CL and the number of 
drippers Ne, that will give the total equivalent l ength L 2 and you can  add to  L1, then you 
get the L value . 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:03 ) 
 
Example 23.2:  Compute  head loss due to pipe friction in a drip lateral with on -line emitters 
for the following data  
 16-mm internal diameter lateral  
 200 m long lateral w ith standard on -line emitters spaced 1 m  
 Design discharge of each emitter is 1 lph  
 Water temperature is 20oC 
Solution:  
 Total discharge = (1 l/hr)  × (200) × (1hr/60min) = 3.33 l/min  
V=Q
A=3.33 l/min
π
4(16mm)2=27.6 cm/sec  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:10 ) 
 
Knowing the velocity you can the estimate the Reynolds  number  
𝑁𝑅= 𝜌𝐷𝑉
𝜇=4406        (𝜌= 998.2 kg/cu m; 𝜇 = 1.002 x10 -3 N-S/m2) 
Since NR is between 2000 -105, use Reynolds number (turbule nt flow) equation to compute 
f 
f=0.32NR−0.25=0.32(4406)−0.25 
K=0.811(f
g)=0.811(0.0393
9.81)=3.25×10−3 
Correcting L in Darcy - Weisbach, Hazen - Willams or Scobey Equation for barb losses  
L = 200 m + (number of emission devices) C L 
from Figure CL = 0.36 ft, = 0.11m  
L = 200 + 200 (0.11) = 222 m  
H1=KCLQm
D2m+n=(3.25×10−3)×277778×222×(3.33)2
162×2+1=2.12 
F = 0.33 (Table value)  
h1=FH1+M1=0.33×2.12+0=0.70 m 
 (Refer Slide Time: 34:15 ) 
 
The table above indicates  the valu es of F used when the distance to the first sprinkler 
equals the sprinkler head spacing. In the first column , the number of out lets is indicated . 
These values of f are used when the  distance to the first sprinkler equal to the sprinkler  
head spacing , just li ke sprinkler  we have the first opening and if this spacing will be equal 
to the spacing between the sprinklers  then this table will be used . For example , previously 
we had calculated that when the number of barbs  or number of emitters is 200 and for m  
equal to 2, f is 0.333 .  The same thing is shown here  f is equal to 0.33 from the table  for 
the number of emitters  200. 
Basically  in this lecture , we learn about drip irrigation  design  and the basic thing is we 
have to estimate the friction head losses . From t he friction  head loss and by knowing the 
discharge from each emitter  and knowing the number of emitters and the barbs you will 
be able to  estimat e the equivalent length due to the barbs that are causing the friction head 
loss. And  the total length will be the lateral length and barb length , which  will be plugged 
into the H azen William or Darcy Weisbach equation  to get the friction head loss . And then 
we have also seen the type of  emitters ; point  source emitters and line source emitte rs. The 
emitter  discharge  is defined  based on the ir colors , for example, black color  is of lower 
discharge  versus the green color  which is having  higher discharge  and it is easier for  people 
to identify a particular discharge  based on the color .  
So, in the next lecture , we have the hydraulic design  of drip irrigation , design for entire  
field crop e.g.,  banana crop or orchard  crop  
Thank you .
