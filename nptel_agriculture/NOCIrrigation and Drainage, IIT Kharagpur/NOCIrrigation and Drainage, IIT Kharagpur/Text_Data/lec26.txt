Lecture  - 26  
Irrigation  Well 
This is lecture  number  26 of the irrigation and drainage lecture series . In this lecture , we are 
going  to learn  about irrigation  wells . This week  and the following  week  we will be 
concentrating  on information  from irrigation  wells,  as well as irrigation  pumps  because  these  
are important  when  you are talking  about extracting  water  or delivering  water  to the field.  We 
have seen how to get water  from canals  now, we  need to understand;  how to get the water  from 
irrigation wells  for irrigation  purpose s. 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 01:17)  
 
To understand that  we need to know the  soil formations and what  are the  different  soil water  
zones;  and what  is an aquifer, what  is a good  aquifer  and aquifer  properties.  So, in this lecture , 
we will be focusing  on the aquifers  and their properties . If you start digging  the soil from the 
surface  you can observe  different  zones  as shown in the image above . The first zone  is where  
the crops  are grown , this zone  is called  the soil-water  zone; as far as crop production  is 
concerned  this is the most important  zone.  Then below  it is an intermediate  zone  and then the 
fringe  water  zone and the groundwater  and the internal  water  zone . In the groundwater  zone , 
the soil is completely  saturated  and if you dig a hole in this particular  zone you will get water . 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 03:02)  
 
The main  zones  are the soil-water  zone,  intermediate  zone,  capillary  fringe  zone,  groundwater  
and internal  water  which  is not accessi ble for usage . The soil water is  called  the belt of soil 
water  and the intermediate zone is also called the intermediate  belt and the fringe zone the 
capillary  belt. In the  portion from the land surface to the water table , the soil pores  are not filled  
with water  every  time, which  is called  suspended  water  or zone  of aeration.  So, this is  called  
the zone  of aeration,  because  the pores will have both air and water  in it. Whereas,  there  is 
another  zone  called  the zone  of saturation  (below the water table) , where  you see the pores  are 
completely  filled  with water.  The zone of aeration  is the unsaturated zone which is also called  
the vadose zone, which  starts from the land surface to  the water  table . Then the complete zone 
of aeration  or vadose  zone water  along with the zone of saturation  is called  the zone  of rock 
fracture , where  the water  is available . The zone  of rock flowing  is where water  will not be 
available  for utility . This way we understand  what  kind of water  is present in the  soil, the first  
is soil water, intermediate  zone,  and capillary  fringe,  and groundwater  and then the unavailable  
deep  groundwater  zone . 
The top of the saturated  zone or groundwater  zone  is called  the water  table.  And this water  
table  is influenced  by atmospheric  pressure  because  the soil above it is not filled  with water  
so, there  is atmosphere  interaction  to the zone.  The pressure  at the water  table  is equal  to the 
atmospheric  pressure . 
The volume  of the Vadose zone  below  the soil moisture  zone  is estimated  to be around  10,000  
mi3, which  is potential  groundwater  recharge . So, here what  we are expectin g whatever  water, 
which  is stored  in the vadose  zone will be contributed  to the groundwater  recharge . 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 07:13)  
 
Next, you can see the soil-water zone  in the picture above , the zone  of aeration  acts like a filter  
for surface water passing through it  or rainfall  that infiltrates  down and this zone is a filter  
meter for recharge to  the groundwater . From the water  table , if you go 0.5 miles  below , it 
accounts  for about  1Mmi3of groundwater . And,  that will be around  3000  times  greater  than 
the volume  of water  in all rivers  so, there  is a huge  amount  of water,  which  is lying  as 
groundwater . But the groundwater  below  0.5 to 5 miles  is not recoverable  it is simply  lying  
over there  and it is not accessible  or not recoverable.  The groundwater  accounts  for nearly  
2/3rd of the fresh water  and the  groundwater  flows at a very slow rate of  10 to 15 m/day.  That 
means,  if you have  a 10 m length room , it will take a day to flow from  one end to the other 
end of the room . At great  depth , the water  may take 10000 years  to pass through  t h e  
aquifer  and some  water is completely  stagnant . 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 09:05)  
Let us see a  simple  example  to see how water  availability  will be used for the existing  
population?   
Example 26.1:  
Assume that the world’s recoverable groundwater is 4×106 Km3. For how long will this water 
be able to meet the needs of the w orld’s population of say 5 billion, if per capita daily 
consumption is taken to be 4000 L.  
Solution:  
𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑑  𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  =  5×109 
𝑃𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎  𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦  𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =4000  L 
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑑  𝑑𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑦  𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  =5×109×4000=2×1013 L/day  
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑  𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦  =4×106 Km3 
=4×1015 m3 =4×1018 L 
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒  𝑡𝑜 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦  𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑤𝑖𝑙𝑙  𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡  𝑓𝑜𝑟 =4×1018
2×1013=2×105 days 
=548 years (Ans.)  
So, it takes  548 years  to deplete  or utilize the entire  water reserve  for the 5 billion  population . 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 10:54)  
 
 
Next, are the type  of geological formations? So, if you go down  below the soil surface it  does 
not mean that  water is available always it all depends on the porous media  present . You can 
have different types of porous media such as sand, clay,  silt loam , rock fractions , or solid 
rocks , all th ese things will be defined based on the type of geological formation and the water 
availability. The types of geological formations are very important to understand, whether we 
will be able to get the water from  a particular location  or not. E ach geological formation has 
a particular property , for example, assume that it is a sponge , the sponge  is a porous media  
and when  you add water it absorbs water at the same time  but if all pores are filled the water 
is going to drain due to gravity so that means, the sponge can absorb as well as transmits  the 
water , that is its particula r property.   
Then similarly, the soil or sands , or other rock material  will have a particular property. So, we 
are going to see whether that property can be favorable  for water availability or not. So, here 
aquifer  is a geological formation, which absorbs w ater and transmits water , it has both 
characteristics , this is very important  because whe n you can extracting water from a water 
source or water reservoir.  Generally,  the soils like sands or gravel have a definite pore 
structure  so, that will be a good  aquifer.  If you observe  the drillers, who drills the wells they 
started checking the material which is coming out from the hole and they will  keep  digging  
until they see sand, when the y see the sand coming out from  the hole then they think that there 
is the aquifer and they stop digging . Because sand  is good aquifer material,  it can  absorb water 
as well as transmit water.  
Similarly aquifuge; is a geological formation  which  neither absorb s nor transmit s water . 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 14:24)  
 
Aquifuge  cannot absorb water and once it is not absorbing then there is no question of getting 
water from  this material. Aquifuge is solid granite  and since there are no definite pores, water 
cannot penetrate in so it cannot absorb or transmit water . Aquifuge is a not geological 
formation  in terms of water availability  because  you do not get any water . 
Aquiclude are porous geological formation s it can  only absorb, but it cannot transmit  water ; 
for example clays  soil, clays absorb water  and starts swelling , hence very small quantity can 
come  out, but it is not transmitting anything.  
Aquitard  as the name indicates is a kind of retard.  So, the aquifer got retarded  that means,  it 
was a good  aquifer  but after a long period , it is retarded . Sand is a good  aquifer  but welcoming 
clay particles into  the system block s the pores  and hence converted to  aquitard . Aquitard also 
absorbs water but it is not going to transmit water, but it is definitely influencing the 
neighboring  aquifers .  Aquitard is a  geological  formation whose  hydraulic conductivity is too 
small  to permit the development of a well or spring, but sufficiently large to influence the 
hydraulics of aquifer adjacent to it , like sandy clay , etc. So these 4 are the important geological 
formations, we need to consider here.  
(Refer Slide  Time: 16:53)  
 
Next is the types of aquifers, an aquifer is geological formations which can absorb and 
transmit water . A confined aquifer  is a reservoir that is present in between two confined layers  
or impervious layer s (an impervious layer means water cannot pass or enter ). Since the water  
is confined between the 2 impervious layers that means, the water or the saturated stratum is 
under pressure. So, if we drill a hole into that or if you put a well into this  the satur ated 
stratum , definitely water will enter through the well  like a jet. This kind of wells are called 
artesian  wells or flowing wells that means, it flows  continuously . If the pressure head, is more 
than the level of the well outlet it is going to flow  and in this case , the well is called a flowing 
well and if the pressure head is less than the length of the well so, it will be staying at a 
particular depth of the well  constantly , in that case, this will be called an artesian  well. 
The rise and fall of water in well results due to the hydrostatic pressure in the strat a.  
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 19:35)  
 
Next is the unconfined aquife r, if you see the unconfined  aquifer case  the saturated stratum is  
bounded on one side by an impervious surface  and the  other part is open to the atmosphere.  
The pressure which is acting on the stratum is the atmospheric pressure  since  one side is  open 
to the atmosphere . The top of the geological formation is known  as the water table.  Whereas, 
the top of a geological forma tion in  the case of a confined aquifer is called a piezometric 
surface or a potentiometric surface . The rise and fall of the water table  result  primarily from 
the changes in the volume of storage in the structure, when the piezometric surface fall below 
the bottom of the upper confined stratum , the confined aquifer becomes an unconfined 
aquifer . Then the pressure equipotential line will be equal to the water table , not the 
piezometric surf ace in the case of a confined aquifer.  When you are not getting enough 
pressure in the confined geological formation , it becomes an unconfined  aquifer . 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:20)  
 
Next is the perched water table, this is a localized condition.  For example , there are clay layers, 
which are formed locally , the water will be stored  on top of the clay layer  just like an 
unconfined aquifer. Since it is locally formed  it is called perched water or perched aquifer and 
the upper water level  is called perched water table because the water table is influenced by 
atmospheric pressure . The perched aquifer is shown in the image above  and it is on top of the 
water table of the unconfined aquifer and it also has a water table  and if you drill a hole to it, 
water will be available.  It is basically formed due to clay or sediment deposits . 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:48)  
 
Next is the leaky aquifer , in the case of the confined aquifer, if you see there is an impervious 
layer  on both the top and bottom of the sat urated strata . Sometimes these impervious layer s 
could be aquifuge where it cannot transmit or absorb water  but s ometimes, these impervious 
layer s are aquitard.  So, in that case , what happens, there is leakage that means, it is not a 
perfectly impervious layer and so this kind of aquifer is called the leaky aquifer . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:46)  
In the leaky aquifer case , the leaky p revious surface could be on top or bottom  or both side s 
of the saturated strata . If you observe  the image above  the leaky aquifer  could be a confined 
leaky or an unconfined leaky. In the case of a leaky confined aquifer , in the  impervious 
layers , you can see the leakage from  the bottom to top  and similarly in the case of the 
unconfined aquifer which is known a s a leaky unconfined aquifer . 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 25:29)  
 
The picture above presents all types of  aquifers. At the recharge area , the recharge is taking 
place  and s ince it is open to the atmosphere  this level is called the water table.  Then from  
there the entire water will be flowing between  the two impervious layers  which  is the 
confined aquifer,  and if you drill a hole at  the confine d aquifer , the water which is under 
hydrostatic pressure is going to flow  out and you get a water level (indicated  by a dotted 
line) called the piezometric surface or potentiometric surfac e.  
Since this piezometric surface is above the top of the well , water  starts flowing 
continuously . If you see t he artesian well the top of the well is mor e than the piezometric 
surface , the water level will be staying in the well  
Above th e confined aquifer , there is a geological formation that has an impervious  bottom 
and on top, there is no impervious surface  and it  is open to the atmosphere. And you can 
see the top of this geological formation is called the water table, because of atmosphere 
intervention.  
So, if you drill a hole (or well) in this layer , the water level is called a water table  and the 
well is called a water table well or phreatic well  since it is connected to the unconfined 
aquifer . You can also see the locally formed aquifer that is the perched aquifer and if you 
have a tube well connected to this perched aquifer there is a perched water table . The image 
show s the aquifers and the wells and then the water table and piezometric surfaces.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 28:20)  
 
Next is the piezometric surface  as explained  earlier it is an imaginary surface, which 
connects all the hydrostatic pressure levels of the water in the confined aquifer. And, the 
elevation of the surface at  a given point  is define d by the water level  in a well  penetrating 
the confined aquifer  at that point.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 28:49)  
 
Similarly , if you see the water  table  as already  explained ; the water  table  is the upper surface 
of the zone of saturation under  atmospheric  pressure.  It is also known as the phreatic surface . 
The recharge  area, if you see in the image above is the region  that supplies water  to the 
ground water . A ground water  basin  is a physiographic  unit containing  one or more  aquifers.  
So, the whole  topography  can have  one or more  than one aquifer.  That is called  a 
ground water  basin  and the aquifers  can be connected  or interrelated . 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 29:47)  
 
Next are the springs , when  water  flows naturally  from the aquifer  to the ground surface  it is 
called  a spring . Suppose  there  is water  which  is infiltrating  down, but you have an 
impervious  surface  that is going  to pass through  and forms  the spring  you can also see in the 
picture above  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 30:23)  
 
Springs  is the component  of the hydrosphere,  you can see in the picture above  the 
groundwater  flow in the confined  aquifer  and unconfined  aquifer . So, the recharge  which  is 
going  in the soil will encounter an  impervious  surface  and some water will  flow to the 
unconfined aquifer. D ue to the impervious  surface , some  of the water  will flow over it then 
come out as spring.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 30:49)  
 
Next is the types  of springs  - it could  be a depression  spring.  In the depression  spring , the 
depression  is connected  to the water  table.  Since  there  is water  connected  to the water  table  
it is going  to flow automatically  because  there  is a depression . 
Another type of spring is the  contact  spring , it is created by a permeable water -bearing 
formation overlying a less permeable formation that intersect s the groundwater. In contact 
spring , for example, the surface  layer  will have h igh K so, more  water  will infiltrate  and 
below that , there  is a low K layer and then in the  next layer , there is h igh K again . So, the 
water  which  is infiltrating  down  cannot  infiltrate  to further  layer , and that will form  as a 
spring . When the low K is sandwiched  between 2 high K’s, then you have this contact spring.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 32:10)  
 
The third one is the artesian  spring,  suppose  there is a high K and low K layer opposite to 
each other as show n in the image above , the water  which  is due to high K is going  to pass, 
but because of the low K, it cannot  penetrate  down. And then there is another h igh K below 
the low K layer s o, water  from  both high K layers will ooze out because  it cannot  enter  
through  the low K layer. So, it resulted from the release of water under pressure from the 
confined aquifer either at the outcrop of the aquifer or thr ough an opening in the confining 
bed.  
And,  then the  tabular  or fracture  spring , sometimes  there  is are fracture s in the soil layers  if 
you see in the image above  the water  or fractures  are connected  or interlinked . The water  
from  all these fracture s finally  oozed  out as spring.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 33:25)  
 
Aquifer  properties  are porosity , void ratio and other  propert ies which are already  explained  
in lecture  number  3 of week  1, you can go through  that. And another  property is effective  
porosity, the effective  porosity  is out of the 100% porosity , how much  participated  in the 
groundwater  flow process , or what  is the percentage  of porosity, which  is effectively used  
in groundwater flow . 
Effective porosity  is the portion  of void space  in the porous mater ial through  which  fluid 
can flow and it is the portion  that experiences  the flow process.  For example,  if you have 
two soil particle s and in between , you have a pore some  portion  of the pore will have fluid 
that will be flowing  the other  is stagnant.  So, in that case, the porosity  is 100% but effective  
porosity  is not 100 %. 
The table in the slide above presents the effective porosity for different aquifer  types, if 
you see for limestone  the effective  porosity  will be 0 to 20%; for  sand 25 to 50 % and for 
clays , it is 40 to 70%. 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 35:10)  
 
The n ext property  is permeability, it is the media  property  (sand property ) not the fluid 
property. Permeability  is the measure  of the media ’s ability  to transmit  fluid under  hydro 
potential  gradient.  If you have some  gradient  of flow the fluid will flow from one place  to 
another  place  due to the property  of a material  that is called  permeability.  
Permeability  is approximately  proportional  to the square  of the mean  grain  diameter , it is 
expressed  as 𝑘≅𝐶𝑑2 
Where, 𝑘= intrinsic (specific) permeability, m2 or darcy  
𝐶 = dimensionless coefficient (shape factor)  
𝑑= mean grain diameter, m  
1 𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑦  = 9.87×10−13 m2 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 36:18)  
 
Next is the hydraulic  conductivity,  it is the property  of the soil as well as the water . It is defined  
as the volume  of water that moves  through a porous medium  in unit time under  a unit hydraulic  
gradient,  through  a unit area measur ed at a right angle  to the direction  of flow.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 37:26)  
 
The equation  is given  by Darcy.  
𝑄=−𝐾(𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑙)𝐴 
Where 𝑄= Discharge  
 𝑑ℎ
𝑑𝑙= Hydraulic gradient  
 ℎ= Head loss  
 𝑙= Length  
 𝐴= Area of cross -section  
 𝐾= Hydraulic conductivity  
The negative  sign indicates  the pressure  gradient  is decreasing  towards  the flow direction . If 
you see here the pressure  in the Darcy  setup  given above,  there is a  sand column.  The column  
is completely saturated  and water  passes through  the water input  pipe and is collected  by the 
water out put pipe. Since it is equilibrium , the Q which  is going  in will be the same  as the Q 
coming  out, but the pressures  are different.  The pressure  at the top of the sand pack is  h1 and 
at the bottom is  h2. The pressure differenc e, dh, and the gradient  is dh/dl . Since the pressure  
difference is h2 - h1 and h2 < h1 that is why the negative  sign is required  to get the positive  Q. 
Knowing  the Q, the area of cross -section  and the gradient  you can estimate  K. 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 38:58)  
 
The K value  has both fluid as well as solid propert ies.  
𝐾=𝜌𝑘 
𝜇 
Where, 𝐾= hydraulic conductivity, m/d  
𝜇= dynamic viscosity, kg/m/d  
𝜌= unit weight of water, kg/m3 
𝑘= intrinsic permeability, m2 or darcy  
The hydraulic  conductivity  K  for different aquifer material is give n in the table above. For 
clays K ranges from 10-8 to 10-2 m/d, it is a big range ; Sand is 20 to 100 m/d; Gravel  100 to 
1000  m/d; Sandstone  0.001  to 1 m/d. Hydraulic  conductivity  will be more  in the case of gravel  
and sand and less very less in the case of clay. 
In this lecture , we mainly  focused  on some  basic  stuff of groundwater,  geological  formation - 
aquifer , aquifuge , aquitard  and aquiclude . And also the different  soil waters  and then the 
properties  of aquifers  were studied,  aquifer  types  - confined  aquifer, unconfined  aquifer, 
perched  aquifer , and leaky  aquifer . 
Then we also studied  the water  table  and piezometric  surface  and also different  wells  based  on 
their connection  to the different  aquifers.  The wells  connecting  to confined  aquifers are called  
artesian  well,  if the well is  connecting  to an unconfined  aquifer  it is called  a phreatic  well or 
water  table  well if the wells  connect  to the perched  aquifer  that is called  perched  water  well.  
Thank  you.
