Hi, welcome to  this lecture number 25 which  is the tutorial for week  5 on Irrigation and 
Drainage series lectures . So, in this , we are going to solve some of the problems related to 
sprinkler and drip irrigation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 0:38 ) 
 
Exercise W5.1  
In a sprinkler irrigation system, the lateral spacing along the mainline is 20 m and sprinkler 
spacing along laterals is 15 m. The application rate for fulfilling the peak demand of the 
proposed crop should be 8 mm/d. Find the discharge rate per sprinkler.  
Solution  
We know application rate, I(mm/h) = 3600  × qs(l/s) 
Sm(m) × Sl(m)   Or, qs = I × Sm × Sl
3600 
Given, I = 8 mm/d  
Assu ming that the sprinkler will operate 12 h a day,   
I = 8mm/12h = 0.667 mm/h, and Sm = 20 m; Sl = 15 m  
Putting the values, qs = 0.055 l/s; Or, 200 l/h (Ans.)  
 (Refer Slide Time: 03:16 ) 
 
So, the first example is a simple  sprinkler irrigation problem where if you have the crop 
demand  in a day and also  the sprinkler spacing , you can find out , what i s the discharge at 
the sprinklers  so that it can meet the demand of the crop in a particular day .

Exercise W5.2  
In a sprinkler irrigation system, the required total capacity of the system is 0.5 m3/s. 
Determine the pump capacity. Assume that head loss in pipe and bends and velocity head 
required = 3 m of water.  
Solution:  
Pump capacity, P = (Q × 9.81 × H) [KW]  ,  
The constant is  9.81 or sometimes you see 76, and sometimes  ɣ and ρ or other  things  these 
constant s will follow  with the units you used. 
Here Q = 0.5 m3/s 
Total head = 3 m  
Putting the values, P = 0.5 ×9.81 × 3 = 14.7 KW (Ans.)  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:19 ) 
 
Exercise W5.3  
A solid set permanent micro -irrigation system is installed in a vegetable field of 1 ha area. 
The spacing between th e micro -sprinklers is 2.5 m and the spacing between laterals is 5 
m. The peak evapotranspiration rate is 10 mm/day. The application efficiency is 80%. The 
irrigation system operates 5 hours in a day. The total operating head of the pump is 30 m. 
At 65% pump effici ency, the horse power of the pump is _______________  
       
Solution:  
Given,  
Area=1 ha  
Evapotranspiration rate = 10 mm/day  
Application efficiency = 80%.  
Total operating head of the pump = 30 m  
Pump efficiency = 65%

Exercise W5.4  Several identical sprinkler nozzles, each having discharge Q (liter per 
minute ), are spaced in a grid of size L (meter) × S (meter). The application rate in mm/h is 
_______

Exercise W5.5  A sprinkler syste m consists of two 192 m long laterals. On each lateral, 16 
sprinklers are located at an interval of 12 m. The spacing between the laterals is 10 m. The 
required capacity (in l/s) of the sprinkler system for an application rate of 1 cm/h is  
Solution:  
Spacing between  the laterals = 10 m  
Application rate ( 𝐼 )= 1 cm/h  
Spacing of sprinkler along the lateral ( 𝑆𝑙)= 12  
Spacing of lateral along the main ( 𝑆𝑚)= 10

Example W5.6  Calculate the flow rate for the following emitters (laminar, turbulent, and 
pressure compensating) at 50 and 100 kPa pressure (coefficient k for units of LPH a nd 
kPa).  
k = 0.02 and x = 1 laminar  
k = 0.2 and x = 0.5 turbulent or orifice  
k = 2 and x = 0 pressure compensating  
If you remember the in the drip irrigation , based on  the pressure and the  discharge  and 
knowing the coefficients , you can identify whether the dripper is orifice type or laminar 
type or pressure compensating type , from the equation 𝑞=𝑘𝑃𝑥.  So, if x =1 that is  laminar 
x = 0.5 it is a orifice type x = 0 that is  a pressure compensating  drippers . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:3 9) 
 
Solution  
X=1 X=0.5  X=0 
q=0.02 (50)1 = 1LPH  q=0. 2 (50)0.5 = 1.4 LPH  q = 2 (50)0 = 2LPH  
q=0.02 (100)1 = 2LPH  q=0. 2 (100)0.5 = 2 LPH  q= 2 (100)0 = 2LPH  
Substituting the values in  𝑞=𝑘𝑃𝑥, suppose the k value 0.02 and x =1 (laminar  case); x 
=0.5 (orifice case ) and x = 0 (pressure  compensating case ). P =50 and doubling the 
pressure P  = 100. 
So, for laminar discharge , q is double  when p ressure is doubled . Similarly,  in the orifice 
case, q is increasing  (1.4 to 2 lph)  when the pressure  is doubled ; where as in the pressure 
compensating case , the discharge does not vary  even if you increase the pressure .

Exercise W5.1  The discharge from a sprinkler nozzle depends on  
a) Operating pressure and nozzle geometry.  
b) Operating pressure and distribution pattern.  
c) Application rate and nozzle angle.  
d) Operating pressure and application rate.  
This last example is a multiple choice question  
If you see  the first option , operating pressure and nozzle geometry , definitely when you 
are talking about discharge , the operating pressure and nozzle geometry influences . So, 
this could be the answer . 
And then second option  operating pressure and distribution pattern  the operating pressure  
will influence but  the distribution pattern is entirely different  because the pattern  may vary  
so it will not influence; but  if you have wind speed and other things , so this will  influence .  
Then application rate  and nozzle  angle , nozzle angle will tell the range , suppose you have 
a 300 nozzle angle , it decides the maximum range , but not the  discharge and then the 
application rate  for the particular crop requirement will decide op erating pressure so it 
influence s the discharge .  Similarly,  operating pressure will influence but the application 
rate will not influence the discharge  
So, in this case , the answer  is:  
a. Operating pressure and nozzle geometry (Ans.)   
So, this is all  in this tutorial . 
Thank you .
