Irrigation Channel Design  
Welcome  to lecture number 12 of Irrigation and Drainage series . In thi s lecture we are 
going to learn  about Irrigation Channel Design . In the previous lecture we’ve focused 
mostly on canal irrigation  conveyance , and also the  structures and canal lining s so, here 
we are going to study  how to design that particular channel . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:42)  
 
Basically th ese irrigation channels are either trapezoidal or rectangular or sometimes you 
may see circular . The main parameters in the design  part is the top wi dth, freeboard , 
channel bed  slope , wetted perimeter and h ydraulic r adius . Suppose you have  a trapezoidal 
channel  with water surface  as shown in the figure above, the  wetted perimeter will be  the 
sum of the sides and the bottom width which is only the wetted  part. Similarly in case of  
circular  the acr which is in contact with the water will be  the wetted perimeter . Hydraulic 
radius  is area divided by  wetted perimeter , so these components are mainly f ocused during 
the design of irrigation channel . The picture  above  clearly shows the  flow depth , channel 
bed and channel top width and then th e channel side  slope . There is a free  board , provided  
for factor of safety  and you need to maintain the free board  for each  irrigation channel . 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 02:40)  
 
Next is the open channel flow , basically  two principles or  two equations are  need ed to 
consider  the Chezy’s  equation and  the Manning’s  equation . Chezy  has come up with this 
equation long back , this is the  oldest equation and then after that  Manning’s  equation is 
developed after doing  certain experiments he just modifie d the  Chezy’s  equation . 
Chezy ’s Equation                  𝑉 = 𝐶√𝑅𝑆 
Manning ’s Equation             𝑉 = 1
𝑁𝑅2/3𝑆1/2  
Where, V = velocity of flow (m/s); R = hydraulic radius of the flowing section (m); S = 
Channel slope, in m per m; C = Chezy’s constant, which varies with surface roughness 
and flow rates, N = Manning’s roughness coefficient . The Chezy’s  constant  C and 
Manning’s  N have the following  relationship  
𝐶 = 1
𝑁𝑅1/6 
The table in slide above shows  some material used in the channels and their N value  for 
concrete , stone masonry , soil c ement , bare soil and vegetative  waterways . Vegetable 
waterways  relatively  give larger roughness compared to other  structure  that i s why if you 
see the N values is more compared to other channel types . So, these  two equations are very 
important when you ar e designing the irrigation channels . 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 04:35)  
 
How to estimate the maximum discharge  through rectangular channel economical ly. So, 
our intention  is to carry maximum flow  in irrigation channels  by finding out which 
condition will achieve t he maximum flow in the  particular structure  and channel . For 
example, in case of a rectangular  channel which has width b and depth d and of course,  
there is a freeboard , what is the condition to achieve the maximum discharge in this 
particular channel  so that we can design the b and d  values . 
 
Area of flow, 𝐴 = 𝑏 × 𝑑 (which the area of rectangle crossection)  
And  𝑏=𝐴
𝑑 
Discharge, 𝑄 = 𝐴 × 𝑉 = 𝐴𝐶√𝑅𝑆     (Chezy’s velocity equation ,  V = C√ RS)  
Wetted pe rimeter, P = b + d + d = b + 2d  
𝑃 = 𝐴 /𝑑 + 2𝑑    (since  𝑏 = 𝐴/𝑑 ) 
So, when the wetted perimeter is maximum you expect maximum discharge  therefore 
differentiating perimeter  with respect to depth to get the maximum discharge . 
𝑑𝑃
𝑑𝑑=−𝐴
𝑑2+2=0    or      𝐴
𝑑2−2=0 
 
 or A=2𝑑2  or 𝑏=2𝑑 
So that means  the depth  or the width  should be  2 times the depth  to get maximum  wetted 
perimeter . 
Then the hydraulic radius  R will be as follows  
The hydraulic radius, 𝑅=𝐴
𝑃=𝑏𝑑
𝑏+2𝑑=2𝑑×𝑑
2𝑑+2𝑑=2𝑑2
4𝑑=𝑑
2 
Hence, for the maximum discharge conditions, b = 2d and  R = d/2  
 So, these are the  twoconditions  you need to consider while  construct ing or designing a 
rectangular  channel  for getting the maximum discharge through the channel . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:28)  
 
What about  the maximum discharge  in case of trapezoidal channel s with side slopes  1 is 
to z that means,  1 vertical and  z horizontal . So, here follow similar steps  as in case of 
rectangular channel . So, here in order to get the area just make triangle on bothsides , and 
then combining the  two triangle with the rectangle  in the middle you will get the area of 
cross section.  
 
Area of 1 triangle of side slope 1: Z =1
2×𝑑×𝑧𝑑 (multiply with 2 for 2 triangle)  
Area , 𝐴=(𝑑×𝑏)+2(1
2×𝑑×𝑧𝑑)=𝑏𝑑+𝑧𝑑2 = 𝑑(𝑏+𝑧𝑑)  
 
 or 𝐴
𝑑=𝑏+𝑧𝑑  𝑜𝑟   𝑏=𝐴
𝑑−𝑧𝑑 
Discharge , 𝑄 = 𝐴 × 𝑉 = 𝐴𝐶√𝑅𝑆 = 𝐴𝐶√𝐴
𝑃𝑆 
We know, 𝑃=𝑏+2√𝑧2𝑑2+𝑑2=𝑏+2𝑑√𝑧2+1  or 𝑃=𝐴
𝑑−𝑧𝑑+2𝑑√𝑧2+1 
P will be minimum when, d𝑃
d𝑑=0; 
d𝑃
d𝑑=−𝐴
𝑑2−𝑧+2√𝑧2+1 or 𝐴
𝑑2+𝑧−2√𝑧2+1=0  
or 𝑑(𝑏+𝑧𝑑)
𝑑2+𝑧=2√𝑧2+1 or (𝑏+2𝑧𝑑)
𝑑=2√𝑧2+1 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:37)  
 
 or (𝑏+2𝑧𝑑)
2=𝑑√𝑧2+1 
 ½ Top width of water = single  sloping side  
Incase of hydraulic radius,  
𝑅=𝐴
𝑃=𝑑(𝑏+𝑧𝑑)
𝑏+2𝑑√𝑧2+1=𝑑(𝑏+𝑧𝑑)
𝑏+(𝑏+2𝑧𝑑)=𝑑(𝑏+𝑧𝑑)
2(𝑏+𝑧𝑑)=𝑑
2 
For maximum discharge or maximum velocity,  
b+2zd
2=T
2=d√z2+1 (the sloping side is equal to half of the top width, T)  
𝑅=𝑑
2 (hydraulic radius is half of flow depth)  
The sloping sid e is equal to h alf of the  top width  and h ydrau lic radius is half of the flow 
depth are the two conditions you have to  satisfy to get the maximum discharge  .

Example 12.1:   
Determine the velocity of flow and discharge capacity of an unlined ca nal branch on a 
grade of 1 m in 800 m having depth of flow 1.5 m, bottom width 0.80 m, and side slope 
1:1.So, this given data if you see depth of flow , bed width , canal bottom  and side slope  are 
given .. 
Solution:  
Depth of  flow, d = 1.5 m;  Bed width, b = 0.8 m;  Canal bottom slope,  
𝑆 = 1
800= 0.00125 ; Side slope, 1:z = 1 : 1  
Channel is unlined, assume roughness coefficient of Manning ’s formula, N = 0.023  
So first of all find out the  area.  
Area, 𝐴 =(𝑏𝑑 + 𝑧𝑑2) = (0.8 × 1.5) + 1 × (1.5)2 = 3.45 𝑚2 
Wetted perimeter, 𝑃 = 𝑏 + 2𝑑√1+𝑧2= 0.8+2×1.5√1+12=5.042  𝑚 
Hydraulic radius, 𝑅 = 𝐴
𝑃=3.45
5.042=0.684 
Velocity, 𝑉 =1
𝑛𝑅2
3𝑆1
2= 1
0.023× (0.684)2/3 ×√0.00125 = 1.193 m/s (Ans.)  
Discharge, 𝑄 = 𝐴𝑉 = 3.45 × 1.193  = 4.116  𝑚3/𝑠 (𝐀𝐧𝐬.) 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 19:25)  
 
Example 12.2:  Design an  earthen channel of trapezoidal section  for the  following 
conditions : 
Discharge Q = 2m3/s ; S lope of the channel bed, 𝑆 = 1
1200; Side  slope , z :1 = 1.3:1;  
Manning ’s n = 0.02 
Solution:  
For most economical trapezoidal section , (𝑏+2𝑧𝑑)
2=𝑑√𝑧2+1   and 𝑅=𝑑
2 
(𝑏+2𝑧𝑑)
2=𝑑√𝑧2+1 or 𝑏+2.6𝑑=2𝑑√1.32+1 or 𝑏=0.68𝑑 
Now,  area, 𝐴 = 𝑑(𝑏 + 𝑧𝑑)= 𝑑(0.68𝑑 + 1.3𝑑)    𝑜𝑟, 𝐴 = 1.98𝑑2 
Discharge, 𝑄 = 𝐴𝑉 = 𝐴 × 1

Putting the values, 2 = 1.98𝑑2 ×1

(Refer Slide Time: 21:31)  
 
 
 𝑑8
3=1.11  
 𝑑=1.04 𝑚 
Then, b = 0.68 d = 0.7072  m 
Assuming a freeboard of 20%  of flow  depth,  depth  of channel would be  
𝑑𝑐 = 1.04 × 1.20 = 1.248 𝑚 ≈ 1.25 𝑚 
Top width = 𝑏 + 2𝑧𝑑𝑐= (0.7072  +2 × 1.3 × 1.25)= 3.957  𝑚 
Channel bed width, d = 0.7072 m ; Flow  depth , d = 1.04 m; Depth of channel = 
1.25 m ; Top width = 3.957 ; Side slope = 1.3:1( H:V) Ans.  
 So, finally,  the dimensions  of the channel , flow depth , top wi dth and side slopes are 
obtained . So, this way you have to  designed the channel  . 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:39)  
 
Pipe flo w of irrigation water , so mostly for pipe flow the equations we use  to describe the 
fluid flow are based on  three  fundamental of physics . One is conservation of ma tter or 
mass, which states that matter cannot be  created or destroyed , but can be converted b y 
chemical process and conservation of energy , energy cannot be  created nor destroyed , but 
it can be converted from  one type to another , for exam ple potential to  kinetic energy . And 
then conservation of momentum , where  a moving body cannot gain or loss m omentum 
unless an external force acts on it . And theori es of hydraulics and fluid flows are Pascals  
law and continuity equation or  conservation of mass and Bernoulli’s  equation or energy 
equation , these theories  are all going to be used i n fluid flow. 
 
 
 
 (Refe r Slide Time: 24:34)  
 
Next is the hydraulic and energy grade lines  for pipe flow , when the water fully flow in a 
pipes there are  two lines basically  one is the hydraulic gradient line , and the other  one is 
energy line . When there is  a smooth flow or lami nar flow  and no friction loss then the 
hydraulic gradient line  may be equal to the energy grade  line. Reynolds  number  determines 
the types of flow in pipes, it is given as  
𝑅𝑒=𝜌𝑉𝑑
𝜇 
Where ρ = density of fluid (kg/m3
) V = mean fluid velocity (m/s);  d = diameter of the 
pipe (m); μ = coefficient of viscosity of the fluid (kg/m/s)  
If the Re value is  less than  2100,  then we called a laminar flow, transition flow  for Re 
ranging from  2100 to 4000  and Re more than  4000  is called turbulent  flow. 
Friction head loss is very important when you are talking about  the total head loss . So, the 
total head includes the elevation head , pressure head , velocity head and  friction head . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:35)  
 
 
 The image above shows the velocity profile in a pipe , at the middle the velocity  is 
maximum  and at the end or surface of  the pipe, the velocity will be minimum because of 
the friction . Suppose you are holding a str ing and the water is flowing  it is not going to 
sack at the surface , but in the middle it is going to sack because there is a friction  force 
which is acting on the  surface . Similar flow will be observed in open channel but you are 
going to  have less velocity in bottom and  more velocity in top . 
The head loss in pipe flow , are major head loss which is the  friction and minor head loss  
which is due to  change  in diameter or change in velocity in  pipe’s  bends , joints , valves and 
similar  items . Darcy  Weisbach  equation  will be us ed to  find out the head loss   
ℎ𝑓=𝐹𝐿
𝐷𝑉2
2𝑔 
Where hf = head loss due to friction (m) ; F= friction factor (Darcy’s friction coefficient) ; 
L = length of pipe (m) ; V = velocity of flow (m/s) ; g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 
m/s2; D = inn er diameter of the pipe (m)  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:34)  
 
Example 12.3:   
Determine the head loss due to friction in an irrigation pipe having 150 m length and 25 
cm diameter. The velocity of flowing water in the pipe is 2.0  
Solution: Head loss according to Darcy -Weisbach formula  
ℎ𝑓=𝐹𝐿
𝐷𝑉2
2𝑔 
V = 2.0 m/s  
Assuming F = 0.025 (as of cast iron)  
 
 ℎ𝑓 = 0.025  × 150
0.25×22
2×9.81  
=3.058  𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟  𝑨𝒏𝒔.   
So, the friction head loss  is obtained by knowing  the discharge and diameter and for  100m 
length  you w ill get h f and based on the given length you can reduce and you can estimate 
the corresponding hf on the particular length . 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:00)  
 
The selection  of pipe  size should be based on the hydraulic capacity , head loss and 
economy . Pipe size  is based on hydraulic capacity that is 𝐴 = 𝑄
𝑉 
Where A = cross -sectional area of the pipe (m2) 𝐴=𝜋𝐷2
4, that is, 𝐷=√4𝐴
𝜋 Q = discharge 
(m3/s); V = permissible velocity of flow (m/s)   
Pipe size base on headloss,  by calculating  the head loss per unit length and also for the 
whole irrigation farm . Similarly for economy by comparing  the prices of the pipes and 
extra cost for  head loss for the entire life and choos ing the least cost . 
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:59)  
 
Example 12.4 : Compute the size of best quality cast -iron pipe that wil l carry 0.03 m3/s 
discharge with a head loss of 2 m per 1,000 m.  
Solution: We know ℎ𝑓=𝐹𝐿
𝐷𝑉2
2𝑔 
𝑄 = 0.03 𝑚3/𝑠 
For 𝐿 = 1000  𝑚, ℎ𝑓 = 2 𝑚 
𝑉 = 𝑄/𝐴 = 𝑄/(𝜋𝐷2/4) 
Thus, 2 = 0.023 × 1000
𝐷× (0.03)2
(𝜋𝐷2/4)2 = 0.023  1000×16×(0.03)2
𝜋2×𝐷5   
Or, 𝐷5 = 0.016779   Or, 𝐷 = 0.4415𝑚 = 44.15 𝑐𝑚 
Hence, pipe diamete r  = 44.15 cm (Ans.)  
 
 
 What we’ve discussed e arlier  is on irrigation  scheduling at farm level . Similarly we  do this 
scheduling  at the canal level and is called canal irrigation scheduling . The aim is to provide 
irrigation water at the right time and right am ount and right place , where as in on -farm the 
irrigation scheduling is basically  when to give irrigation , how much to give irrigation , and 
how to give irrigation . Right time and right amount and right place  are three  important  aim 
for the canal systems . Canal scheduling types  on how to  release water at the canal level 
are rigid schedules and flexible  schedules . 
In rigid schedules  the time to give water  is fixed for a particular season  which may be on 
a particular month or particular day or  particular hour where as the flexible scheduling case , 
is basically on the demand basis and you can change the  dates or  amount  of water . So, let 
us see  what are the types of canal schedulin g and which part of India  is really practicing 
these schedules . 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:44)  
 
Rigid scheduling is when the canal is operated continuously at a constant flow rate and the 
flow rate is general ly 15 to 30 lps with frequenc ies of 7 to 14 days with durations of 8, 12 
or 24 hours . And it is fixed that why it is called  rigid  schedule  and it involves  relatively 
low capital investment  but then it cause im proper  irrigation  timing and also excess 
irrigation or runoff . This is the main  drawback in this system  since  we are not noticing the 
demand but supplying  at a constant rate an d constant  time and specific time . So, sometime 
water may not be utilized  by the farm er at the farm level , which is the main reason  for low 
water efficiency .  
Whereas, flexible control  schedule s are expensive because you have to modify the 
schedules , and instruct the stakeholders  and it takes little more  effort . Optimizing the 
 
 farming operations and maintaining sustainable  irrigated  agriculture , and large irrigation 
systems are available to irrigate  each crop when needed . Since it is demand base d 
sometimes you have  unexpected demand  and we need to cop e with that .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 35:47)  
 
There are several  canal irrigation scheduling’s  available in India  which  are already in 
practice . The first  one is Warabandi , Wara means turn  bandi means fixation  so, the water 
supply  turn is fixe d. Water distribution is performed by turns based on the predefined 
irrigation schedule . This is a rigid scheduling  model  and the upper tier is operated by state 
agency . If you see the following image  there is river , and  from there , there  is the main 
canal , the branch canal  and then  the distributaries , so from  the distributary  you get water 
to the  fields . The dotted lines are operated or managed by farmers  whereas, the other things 
are owned by or managed by  state a gencies . So, that is why the upper tier is ope rated by 
state agency the lower tier  is managed by fa rmer s. 
 
 
 This system  has a greater social acceptance , because mostly the water  is coming whether 
you require water or not. And the main limitation is the equitable distribution of water to 
tail end farmers is not possible due to seepage  losses in the serving length . So, at the tail 
end sometimes the farme r may not  receive water because of the seepage losses . 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:33)  
 
Shejpali is another  irrigation scheduling  method this is also  a rigid scheduling  type. It is 
practiced in Maharashtra  and Gujarat  and priority is given to the tail end farmers . So, on 
the previous Warabandi case head end farmers are given the priority whereas,  Shejpali  is 
opposite to that  because  the tail end farmers are given water and then  later on the head end 
farmer s are served . Shejpali  solve the tail end problem of Warabandi system. F armers are  
required to apply  irrigation water  right s for the particular crop over a particular area each 
season . The m ain limitation of this method is the tail end de privation  which result due to 
the inequality water supply  between head end and tail e nd fa rmer .  
Block system , is mostly  practice in western  Maharashtra . The  state enters  into a 6 to 12 
year agreement with the  group of farmers , to provide  fixed quantity  of water for a 
particular  crop pattern . So, the fa rmers in the block are required to pay  for the volume of 
water delivered as  measured by the irrigation agency . Block system is also device to 
encourage  investment in sugar cane cultivation , because sugar belt  needs lots of water , and 
since there is a water in  the canal , so canal water can be used  for raising  sugarcane  crop.  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 40:03)  
 
Assured irrigation is another  rigid scheduling . So, here what happened some group of 
farmers are assured  irrigation  till the last water ing then the remaining  kind of extra water 
is allotted to the  probable ir rigation area within the system . So, the assured irrigation area 
farmers are billed each  season  whereas  the probable irrigation area are billed  following 
their application for water . 
Land classification  is is another canal irrigation scheduling method  practice in the state of  
Bihar  and southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala  where  surface irrigation water is 
allocated according to the  land class es such as  paddy or other land classes . The entire land 
irrigation command area is classified  with regards to  right to irrigation  water , certain key  
aspects  of operating irrigation schedule’s  are decided  at meeting s with the  district 
collectors  and the y decide  which crops required  more  water  or priority  . 
This is all about the  irrigation  channel design , in this class we were focusing on what are 
the design parameters what are the economic design and what is the maximum  discharge 
condition we attain  when there is a  rectangular channel or trapezo idal channels . Then how 
to design a pipe  diameter  pipe size  based on the flow condition . Then similar to the fa rm 
irrigation scheduling’s  there i s a canal irrigation scheduling . Canal irrigation scheduling is 
classified in  two types  one is the rigid scheduling and the  other  one is flexible scheduling . 
So, most  prominent rigid  schedule i s the Warabandi. So with this  introduction and 
background , the canal conveyance as well as the channel design  is completed . In the next 
class we will be focusing  more on water measurement , and also some example . And the 
finally, the tutorial class will focus on the examples related to gate questions . 
Thank you  so much .
