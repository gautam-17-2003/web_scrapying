Lecture  - 05 Tutorial  I 
Friends  welcome  to lecture  number  5 of Irrigation  and Drainage  lecture  series.  So, in this 
lecture , we are going to  solve some problems related to GATE examination  questions with the 
help of W hatever  theory  we have learned  during  this last week .  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 00:58)  
 
Exercise 1 Show that the water content (W), specific gravity (G), degree of saturation (Sr) 
and void ratio (e) are related as  
So, here previously  what  we have learned,  we can get some  feedback  from  those  lectures  
We know  
Water  content  (W) = 𝑤𝑤
𝑤𝑠 
 Void  ratio  (e) = 𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠 
Degree  of saturation  (Sr) =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑣 
Unit  weight  (𝛾) = 𝑤
𝑉 
Specific  gravity  (G) = 𝛾𝑠
𝛾𝑤 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 09:01)  
 
So let  us start with WG,  
𝑊×𝐺 =𝑤𝑤
𝑤𝑠×𝛾𝑠
𝛾𝑤 
𝑊𝐺 =𝑤𝑤
𝑤𝑠×𝑤𝑠
𝑉𝑠
𝑤𝑤
𝑉𝑤 
𝑊𝐺 =𝑤𝑤
𝑤𝑠×𝑤𝑠
𝑉𝑠×𝑉𝑤
𝑤𝑤 
𝑊𝐺 =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑠 
Dividing numerator and denominator with the volume of void V v 
𝑊𝐺 =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠
𝑉𝑣 
𝑊𝐺 =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑣×𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠 
As we can see V w/Vv is equal to the degree of saturation and V v/Vs  
𝑊𝐺 =𝑆𝑟×𝑒 
So, in this way , we started with  W G and end with Sr into e. 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 09:05)  
 
 
Exercise 1.2: Show the relationship between unit weight ( 𝛾), specific gravity ( 𝐺), void ratio 
(𝑒), Degree of saturation  (𝑆𝑟) and Unit weight of water ( 𝛾𝑤) 
𝛾= (𝐺+𝑒×𝑆𝑟)×𝛾𝑤
1+𝑒 
So, here as we did the previous.   
Unit  weight  (𝛾) = 𝑤
𝑉 
Void  ratio  (e) = 𝑉𝑣
𝑉𝑠 
Degree  of saturation  (Sr) =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑣 
𝛾=𝑤𝑤 +𝑤𝑠
𝑣𝑣 +𝑣𝑠 
We know 𝛾𝑤=𝑤𝑤
 𝑣𝑤 and 𝛾𝑠=𝑤𝑠
 𝑣𝑠 Substituting in the above equation  
𝛾=𝛾𝑤 𝑣𝑤+𝛾𝑠 𝑣𝑠
𝑣𝑣 +𝑣𝑠 
We know Specific  gravity  (G) = 𝛾𝑠
𝛾𝑤  Substituting in the above equation  
𝛾=𝛾𝑤 𝑣𝑤+𝐺 𝛾𝑤𝑣𝑠
𝑣𝑣 +𝑣𝑠 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 11:34)  
 
𝛾= (𝑣𝑤+𝐺 𝑣𝑠)𝛾𝑤
𝑣𝑣 +𝑣𝑠 
We know Degree  of saturation  (Sr) =𝑉𝑤
𝑉𝑣 Substituting in the above equation  
𝛾=(Sr𝑣𝑣+𝐺 𝑣𝑠)𝛾𝑤
𝑣𝑣 +𝑣𝑠 
Dividing all the compone nts with V s both numerator and denominator  
𝛾=(Sr𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑠+𝐺 𝑣𝑠
𝑣𝑠)𝛾𝑤
𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑠+𝑣𝑠
𝑣𝑠 
𝛾=(Sr𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑠+𝐺 𝑣𝑠
𝑣𝑠)𝛾𝑤
𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑠+𝑣𝑠
𝑣𝑠 
We know 𝑒=𝑣𝑣
𝑣𝑠 Substituting in the above equation  
𝛾= (Sr×𝑒+𝐺)𝛾𝑤
1+𝑒

Exercise 1.3. A tensiometer, attached with a mercury manometer, is installed 0.4 m below the 
soil surface , the height of mercury in the cup 0.2 m for saturated soil. The density of mercury 
is 13600 kg/m3. The rise of mercury in manometer at 0.6 -atmosphere tension is?  
So, let us say ψM is equal  to 0.6 atmosphere s. So, what  would  be h?  
We know  the formula  𝑃=𝜌𝑔ℎ 
P is pressure  in N/m2, and ρ is the density,  kg/ m3and g is acceleration  due to gravity  m/s2 
and h in meter.   
Given  
Tensiometer depth = 0.4 m  
Height of mercury  in the cup = 0.2 m  
Density of mercury = 13600 kg/m3 
P = 0.6 atm = 0.6 ×1.013 × 105 N/m2 
ℎ=0.6 ×1.013  × 105 
13600  ×9.81=0.456  𝑚 
h is equal  to 0.456  meter s. So, in this exercise  gives  we c onvert  atmospheric pressure  
into height  of water  column  ok.

Exercise 1.4. A wheat field needs to be irrigated with the depth of irrigation of 50 cm, the 
duration of the crop season is 125 days. A stream size of 15 lps flowing for 15 hours a day 
can irrigate an area of ?  
Solution:  
  Depth of irrigation = 50 cm  = 0.5 m  
  Duration of the crop =125 days  
Stream size, Q = 15 lps = 15×10-3 m3/s 
  For 15 hours the volume of water is = 15 × 10-3 × 15 × 3600 × 125  
                         = 101250 m3 
  𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎 =𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒
𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡 ℎ=101250
0.5 
           = 202500  𝑚2=202500
10000=20.25 ℎ𝑎 
          𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎  = 20.25 ℎ𝑎

Exercise 1.5. The root zone depth of the crop is 90 cm , and its availability water holding 
capacity is 15 cm/meter. Irrigation to be applied when 40% available water in the root zone is 
depleted. If daily consumption use is 3 mm, the irrigation period is     
For 1 meter,  Water holding capacity = 15 cm/meter  
Root zone depth of crop = 90 cm = 0.9 m  
So, now you have  to find out the moisture -holding  capacity  with 90 cm 
   Water holding capacity at 0.9 m = 15 × 0.9 = 13.5 cm  
Irrigation was applied when  40% available water in the root zone is depleted  
   Irrigatio n required = 40/100 × 13.5  = 5.4 cm= 54 mm  
 Daily consumption use = 3 mm  
So, daily  withdrawal  is 3 mm per day from  this reservoir   
So, how many  days you need  to give irrigation?   
Irrigation period = 54/3 = 18 days  
So, total, it takes  18 days to deplete  this 40 percent  of total available water.  So, in this way 
you can calculate  the irrigation  next irrigation . The first irrigation is after18 days, and  you 
have  to give next irrigation  to replenish  that 40 percent  of water.  
(Refer  Slide  Time: 23:56)  
 
Exercise 1.6:A crop  has effective root zone depth of 1200 mm and monthly (30 days) crop 
evapotranspiration of 260 mm. The effective rainfall during the 30 days period is 20 mm. The 
field capacity and permissible soil moisture depletion (volume basis) are 1 6% and 8%, 
respectively. The irrigation interval in days for the crop will be        
So this is the last example  of this tutorial ,  
   Effective root zone depth = 1200 mm  
  Crop evapotranspiration (ET) =260 mm  
  Time Period = 30 days  
  Daily consumption u se  = 260 mm /30 days  
  Effective rainfall =20 mm  
  Feld capacity =16%  
Permanent wilting point = 8%  
 
 
 
 
 
(Refer  Slide  Time: 25:20)  
 
 
So first the net depth  of irrigation is calculated.  
Net depth  of irrigation   = (16−8)
100 ×1200  = 96 mm  
Irrigation  interval  = Net depth  of irrigation +Rainfall
Daily  consumption  use  
= 96+20
260
30  
= 116
8.67= 13.37 
             ~13 days  
So, every  13 days you have to give irrigation  
So, these  tutorials  covered  soil physical  properties  and then irrigation  intervals.  
Thank  you so much.
