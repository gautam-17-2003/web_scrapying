Hurdle Technology, High & Intermediate Moisture Foods
In this lecture, an important aspect of food processing, which is commonly known as
‘hurdle technology’ and its use in stabilization of high moisture or intermediate moisture
foods is studied.
Hurdle  technology  is  the combined  use of several  preservation  methods  to make  a
product  shelf-stable,  to  improve  its  quality  and  to  provide  additional  safety  to  the
product.  It  is  also  known  as  “combined  method  technology”.  The  spoilage  and
pathogenic microorganisms are not able to jump over the individual factors, which are
applied to the food i.e.  the combined factors are generally called hurdles.
Some bacterial cells are shown in the picture. Different factors like temperature, pH,
water activity, gaseous atmosphere, food preservatives, etc. are the hurdles. So, if these
factors are applied individually then in order to get the desired sterility severe conditions
of individual factors might be required. But, when they are applied together then many a
times  various  synergist effect  occurs  by different  factors.  So,  their  severity  can  be
reduced and even the microorganism find it difficult to jump over them to overcome the
stress created by the different factors together.Principles of hurdle technology
•Preservative factors or hurdles disturb the homeostasis of microorganisms.
•Microorganisms are not able to “jump over” all the hurdles present in the food
product.
•Preservative factors prevents microorganisms from multiplying and causing them
to remain inactive or even die.
•The hurdle concept illustrates that complex interactions of temperature, water
activity, pH, etc. are significant to the microbial stability.
The overall concept of the hurdle technology has been shown in picture. If there is only
one factor, it becomes easy for the microorganism to crossover but when there are 2 or
more factors, it may be that microorganism has jumped one but cannot cross others.
Finally, it dies and the food gets stabilized. So, the complex interactions of the various
factors like temperature, water activity, pH, etc. are utilized in  positive sense to get a
better product with longer shelf life and better value.Hurdle technology in the antimicrobial packaging system compared to the conventional
packaging system
In the top portion of the figure, when any packaging material is applied, the laminates
may provide oxygen barrier and are impermeable to moisture. Antimicrobial compounds
can also be mixed with the packaging material. Ultimately the products have better
quality and long shelf life.
Advantages of hurdle concepts 
•It can avoid the severity of one factor for preservation. 
•Combination factors act synergistically.•Hurdle at lower concentrations prevents undesired side effects, lowers production
cost and saves energy. 
•Using natural preservatives in combination with synthetic preservatives.
•Hurdle technology foods remain stable and safe even without refrigeration. 
Hurdles used to preserve food
Physical hurdles which can be used may include aseptic packaging, high temperature
(blanching, pasteurization, sterilization, extrusion, baking, frying), ionic radiation, low
temperature (chilling, freezing), modified atmosphere, etc. Physico-chemical hurdles are
carbon dioxide, ethanol, lactic acid, low pH, etc. as listed in the slide. 
Non-thermal methods as hurdles
•High intensity PEF  has a good potential to be used together with pH, water
activity, etc. It causes changes in the cell membrane due to an electromechanical
instability.
•Combination of heat, lysozyme & high intensity PEF are potential alternative for
the heat sterilization.
•Possible  synergistic  effect  along  with  pH  &  ionic  strength  result  in  the
inactivation of Escherichia coli at 10° to 15°C.
The electric field and ionic strength are related to the poration rate and physical
damage of the cell membranes.
Increase  in  the  field  intensity  and  number  of  pulses  increase  the  extent  of
inactivation. 
pH  changes  the  cytoplasmic  conditions  due  to  the  osmotic  imbalance
caused by poration.
•Combination  of  pH,  ionic  strength,  temperature,  and  antimicrobial
agents offer great promise as non-thermal hurdles.
High hydrostatic pressure as hurdle
•Commercial pasteurization or sterilization of low-acid foods using high pressure
is difficult without additional factors. Enzymes or microorganisms provide veryhigh resistance to pressure under low acid conditions. If the pressure is combined
with temperature or water activity, it might have a much better effect.
•Heat, antimicrobials, ultrasound, and ionizing radiation are combined with high
pressure to accelerate rate of inactivation.
•Antimicrobial  effect  of  high  pressure  increases  with  heat,  low  pH,  carbon
dioxide, organic acids, and bacteriocins such as nisin. 
•Combination  with  acetic,  benzoic,  or sorbic  acids,  sulfites,  polyphenols,  and
chitosan allow lower processing conditions and better beneficial effects.
Microbial stability of food preserved by hurdle technology
Intermediate-moisture foods (IMF)
•IMF have moisture content higher than their dry counterparts  and are stable
without refrigeration (a w  0.75 – 0.85). 
•0.85  is  the  minimal  a w for  growth  of  spoilage  producing  organisms  like
Staphylococcus aureus . 
•Solutes and humectants for adjusting to IMF a w ranges are sugars, salts, and
polyols.
• The quantities of the solutes needed to reach IMF a w range should not 
Impart undesirable sensory characteristics 
Affect the physical properties of the food product
•IMF aw restricts potential microbial spoilage mainly fungi & bacteria.
•For  the  IMF  to  be  stable  without  refrigeration,  addition  of
preservatives provides safety margin. Adding more amount of solutes or removing more amount of water from the foods, may
adversely affect the sensory and textual characteristics. So, a combination of both i.e.
partly remove the water and partly add the humectants would work better in stabilizing
the food.
So, various factors which provide stability to the intermediate moisture foods, include
water  activity,  redox  potential,  pH,  addition  of  preservatives  as  well  as  thermal
treatments. So, these should be properly optimized to get the room temperature stabilized
intermediate moisture foods.
Fruits as IMF
•Fruits can tolerate pH reduction without affecting flavour significantly.
•Minimum addition of humectants  for a w reduction to maintain freshness and
converting them into suitable grade IMF.
•To  compensate  stability,  for  the  high  moisture  of  the  product,  a  blanching
treatment can be applied.
•pH reductions that will not result in flavour impairment can be employed.
•Permitted preservatives can be used to reduce the risk of spoilage. 
•Combination of these factors for hurdle technology principles applied to fruits,
results in alternative to traditional IMF fruits is a better strategy to prepare stable
and good quality hurdle technology foods.
•Low  pH  (majority  of  fruits)  &  organic  acid  affect  growth  of  acid-tolerant
microbes e.g. fungi (predominantly molds) & lactic acid bacteria. 
•In fruits with high pH (e.g., banana, melon, fig, & papaya), the minimum pH
adjusted should be compatible with natural flavor of the fruit. 
•Additional hurdle of incorporating preservatives e.g. weak lipophilic acids (i.e.,
sorbic or benzoic acid). 
•Blanching inactivates enzymes or injures microorganisms, reducing the initial
microbial load.
• Sulfiting agents are used in low concentrations to inhibit nonenzymatic browning
reactions.High-moisture food products (HMFP)
•Food  with  aw as  high  as  0.98  can  be  stabilized  using  combined  hurdles
technology.
•The pH exert a strong selective pressure on the existing microflora.
•pH  range  of  HMFP  (3-4.1)  might  not  represent  the  optimum  for
growth and the microorganism may not be able to grow under this pH .
•pH - aw interaction in the applied ranges will be enough to suppress the growth of
most bacteria of concern in fruit preservation .
•At  high  levels  of  a w,  the  effects  of  pH  on  osmophilic  yeasts  might
be the same as for non-osmophilic yeasts. 
Preservation of HMFP
•Common hurdles used for providing microbial stability to the HMFP are
Blanching
Water activity depression 
Lowering of pH 
Addition of chemical preservatives (sorbate or benzoate)
The addition of sulfite as an anti-browning agent
•Food is preserved by interference with the homeostasis of microbes
Homeostasis is the tendency to uniformity or stability in normal status
(internal environment) of organisms. 
Homeostasis is disturbed by the preservative factors (a w, pH, additives,
etc.); the microorganisms will not multiply or may even die.  
•Microbial  stability  could  be  achieved  with  an  intelligent
combination of hurdles.
Effect of certain hurdles on microbial cell hydrolysis
Water activity
•Water  activity  effect  on  majority  of  microorganisms  are  related
to the water status.  It is not only the water quantity, but in the form in which
water represent i.e. water activity.•Microorganisms  are  metabolically  active  only  in  a  certain
range of water activities. 
•Microorganisms  do  not  contain  water-impermeable  barriers
and tend rapidly into osmotic equilibrium with their surroundings. 
•At  reduced  aw,  the  osmolality  of  the  environment  will  be  high
and  the  solutes  present  cannot  penetrate  the  cell  membrane  because  of  the
gradient in the osmotic inside as well as outside the cell, in order to maintain the
equilibrium; the microorganisms lose water.
•The  loss  of  water  results  in  a  reduced  metabolic  activity  and,  at  least
temporarily, growth ceases, affecting the homeostasis of the cell. 
Food pH
•pH is a principal factor that determine the survival and growth of microorganisms
in food.
•The microflora is affected by free [H+] & concentration of undissociated weak
acids.
•Weak acids cause leakage of H+ across the cell membrane, acidifying the cell
interior and inhibiting transport mechanisms.
•Growth inhibition can in principle be caused by interference with cell membrane,
metabolic enzymes, protein synthesis system or genetic material.
•In  a  mixed  initial  flora,  the  acidity  and  pH  of  the  food  may  determine
the potential spoilage microorganisms.Increased acidity
•Acidity slows down the growth of spoilage organisms and pathogens.
• Pathogens won’t grow and spores won’t germinate at pH < 4.5 (e.g. fruit juices
& sauerkrat).
Preservatives
Inhibit bacteria, yeasts and molds
Used at low levels (mg /kg) for specific applications. 
         Example, 
         Benzoate  in  soft  drinks,  propionates  in  baked  goods,  nitrites  in  meat,
sulfites in wines), ascorbates in juices, etc.
Blanching
•An early processing step for destruction of contaminating organisms.
•Blanching  is  a  comparatively  less  severe  heat  treatment  applied  to  fruits  or
vegetable tissues, as a preprocessing step. The main aim here is to inactivate
enzymes or sometime it also results in bacterial destructions.  
•The water activity and pH hurdles, with blanching step reduces initial microbial
count, disturb the homeostatis & assure microbial stability.
•Decrease  in  the  viable  numbers  occur  during  the  a w,  pH  &  preservatives
equilibrium stage in which the blanched food is exposed.  And, once after the
once  the  equilibrium  is  set  then  after  few  time  slowly  and  slowly  the
microorganisms die, there is a decrease seen in the viable numbers count during
this stage. This is called as autosterilization process of stable hurdle technology
foods.
•Microorganisms  exert  every  possible  repair  mechanism  to  overcome  hostile
environment;  thus  they  completely  use  up  energy  and  die  by  becoming
“metabolically exhausted”.
•There  are  several  reports  in  the  regard  that  the  HT  processed  fruits  are
microbiologically stable in non-refrigerated storage for 3 to 8 months.
Hurdles technology in quality control and hazard analysis
•Sanitation  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for  production,  and  contamination  can
always be minimized by employing proper sanitary and handling techniques. 
•Proper HACCP program should be designed to assure safety of HT foods.
•Overall quality of HMFP is necessary; GMP should be adopted.
•It should not represent significant risks of pathogenic hazards. 
•Inhibition of food-spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms should be ensured.
•Food quality attributes should also be preserved.
•HT  foods  must  have  a  consistent  texture,  fresh  appearance,  and  acceptable
colour.
Sensory characteristics of hurdle technology foods
•Hurdle technology results in products with good sensory characteristics. 
•The  combined-methods  technology  applied  by  placing  blanched  food  into  a
solution of sucrose, acids, and additives in such concentrations  that after the
stabilization time, the desired water activity, pH, and additive concentrations are
obtained.
•The  major  changes  are  the  result  of  an  osmotic  concentration
process during stabilization process.Hurdle technology and minimally processed foods
Methods and technologies  for preserving foods that induce minimum change in the
fresh-like quality characteristics of the food. T here minimally processed foods are those
which are exposed to least possible severe treatments or minimum possible processing.
•Food as fresh as raw to supply a RTE or RTU product.
•Major consumer trend of light products (low calories, fat, sugar & salt).
•Additives removed and replaced by natural ingredients.
•Operations involved 
 Trimming
 Peeling  & cutting
 Washing
 Disinfecting
 Packaging. 
•Mild  preservation  methods  for  the  production  of  fresh-like,  but
stable and safe foods.Combines novel preservation techniques to inhibit microorganisms
•Several high-moisture fruit products are developed and stabilized.
•The stability is evaluated by determining the native microbial load of food and
syrups in different stages of the preservation & storage. 
•Heating  during  blanching  significantly  reduces  yeast,  mold  and  aerobic
microorganisms counts.
•Number of microbes is lowered still more during the equilibration stage because
of heat's preservative-sensitizing effect on the survivors.
Development of HT food products
•HMFPs are developed taking into consideration 
•Microbial stability 
•Extended shelf life of at least 3 months without refrigeration
•The chemical overload must be reduced.
•The different combinations or hurdles which can be used may be refrigeration,
slight thermal treatment, non-thermal treatment, use of natural antimicrobial, etc.
•Predictive models can be used to select the hurdles and their levels to assure
stability and safety of the products.
Future trends in HT Foods 
Microbiological control
•Control  measures  for  heat-resistant  molds  that  implicate
in  spoilage  outbreaks  are  needed.  How  the  different  heat  resistant  micro-
organisms can be controlled by using less severe processes are to be evaluated.
•Examination  for  Byssochlamys  species,  Talaromyces  flavus,
and Neosartoria fisheri can be helpful.
•Inhibition  of  sorbate  resistant  yeasts  and  molds  should  be
studied.
•Zygosaccharomyces  bacilii,  in HMFP is resistant  to  heat,
low pH, reduced aw, and sorbic & benzoic acids.•Antimicrobial systems in plants are natural preservatives.
•Hurdles  with  combination  of  spice  essential  oils  inhibit  microbial
growth effectively.
Mano-thermo-sonication
•Combination of low pressure (0.3 MPa), mild heat treatment, and ultrasonic wave
treatment, for inactivation of microorganisms.
•Inactivation  of  peroxidase,  lipoxygenase,  and  polyphenol  oxidase  by  mano-
thermo-sonication is reported.
•Synergistic  effect,  reduce  enzyme  resistance  &  heat  treatment  required  for
inactivation.
•Processing  of  milk,  juices,  and  other  drinks  to  solve  problems  caused  by
thermostable enzymes. 
•More research is needed to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the observed
enzyme inactivation under this new technique.
So, to understand the mechanism, how the synergistic effect actually results, the way of
better utilization of the technology should be taken up to successful commercialization of
the process.Osmodehydrofreezing
•Combined process in which osmotic dehydration is followed by air dehydration
and freezing.
•Fresh like reduced-moisture vegetable ingredients free of preservatives.
•Osmotic concentration followed by air drying using the hurdle technology as an
alternative to traditional drying
•Advantage of the porous microstructure of the osmodehydro frozen products , as
well as increasing water transfer rate, reduced drying or freezing time and better
reconstitution characteristics.
