Module 01: Fundamentals  
Lecture 03: Laplace Transform Review -II 
We will start lecture three , Laplace transform review under the fundamentals . So we are still 
in module one ; we are covering Laplace transform review . We came up to unit pulse function. 
Now we will start with unit impu lse function.  
(Refer Slide Time: 0:43)  
 
We are covering concepts Unit impulse function, Sinusoidal function, Transform of 
derivatives, Transforms of integrals, Box function and Ready reckoner, which is a list of 
Laplac e transform for common functions that are encountered in signal processing or control.  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:05)  
 
So, unit impulse function is basically this box function which was unit pulse, if its width 
becomes 0 an d height become infinite, then we call it impulse. What is the common example 
of impulse function in electrical circuit? The switch I was talking about that, we came at 9 
o'clock turn on the switch and then turn it off at 9’o’5 that is your box function or  unit pulse 
function. Impulse function means the width is 0 and the height is infinite ; that is known as a 
spike.  
Now, electrical circuit spike is a very important operation because if something is spiking, you 
have to make sure that it does not damage your  equipment. So, voltage stabilizers are used just 
to avoid spikes in the computer. So, spike is : it is going straight to infinity, like this ; width is 0 
and height is in finite.  
So Laplace transform of unit impulse function  
𝑳[𝜹𝟎(𝒕)]=𝑳𝒕
𝑨→𝟎𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔𝑨 
 That is the Laplace transform we found out for pulse function. Now, 𝑨→𝟎. So, we apply L 
hospitals rule ; this is a basic rule in calculus differential calculus L Hospital's Rule, that means, 
whenever we have limit of something going to 0, and this is sort of indeterminate, we apply a 
differentiation. Differentiation in the numerator, we apply differentiation in the numerator, and 
we apply differentiation in the denominator  with respect to  A, the variable  which is going to 0 . 
So, here with respect to A if you do you get 𝒔𝒆−𝒔𝑨 and minus minus cancel, and the 
denominator A goes to 0, so, it is 𝒅
𝒅𝑨(𝒔𝑨). So, you are differentiating with respect to  A, set is 
s, so, s, s cancel, and A goes to 0. So, this thing is 1.  
So, this is the Laplace transform of unit impulse function if the function is having 0 width then 
going to infinite then it has a Laplace transform of 1.  
(Refer Slide Time: 3:17)  
 
Now, Sinusoidal function – Sinusoidal function is 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕, we know that 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕 is defined as 
𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕−𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕
𝟐𝒋. So, this is the nature of sin curve , sin function. So , 
𝑳[𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕]=𝟏
𝟐𝒋∫(𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕−𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎=𝟏
𝟐𝒋∫(𝒆−(𝒔−𝒋𝝎)𝒕−𝒆−(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)𝒕)𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎 
So, I am just taking s and j omega together for two cases ; this is plus 𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕 this is minus 𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕. 
Then we go the integration will be this thing here divided by the factor ; this is also integration 
here divided by the factor that goes from 0 to infinity. So, this is algebra you can do at your 
home no problem, 𝟏
𝟐𝒋(𝟏
(𝒔−𝒋𝝎)−𝟏
(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)).  
So, that if I expand it , in the numerator (𝒔+𝒋𝝎)−𝒔+𝒋𝝎. So, 𝑳[𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕]=𝝎
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐. So, 
𝑳[𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕]=𝒔
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐. 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕: 𝝎in the numerator ; 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕: 𝒔 in the numerator . That is the 
difference ; otherwise the denominators are same.  
(Refer Slide Time: 4:50)  
 
Transforms or derivati ves – This is very important because if the function is differentiated then 
what is the transform? So  𝑳[𝒅𝒇(𝒕)
𝒅𝒕]=∫𝒅𝒇(𝒕)
𝒅𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎=∫𝒅𝒇(𝒕)𝒆−𝒔𝒕∞
𝟎. So, ∫𝒅𝒇(𝒕)𝒆−𝒔𝒕∞
𝟎 is 
equal to , see this thing here ∫𝒅𝒇(𝒕)
𝒅𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎, 𝒅𝒕 𝒅𝒕 got cancelled.  
So, I have ∫𝒅𝒇(𝒕)𝒆−𝒔𝒕∞
𝟎. Taking the integration by parts 𝒖=𝒆−𝒔𝒕, 𝒅𝒖
𝒅𝒕 the different iation of that 
=−𝒔𝒆−𝒔𝒕 and 𝒅𝒗, rest of the thing is 𝒅𝒗, which is 𝒅𝒇(𝒕). So, 𝒗 is equal to  𝒇(𝒕). So, 𝒖𝒗 now 
becomes this into 𝒇(𝒕). So, that is what you get here, 𝒖𝒗 𝒇(𝒕)𝒆−𝒔𝒕and this is your 𝒗𝒅𝒖 , minus 
sign, two minus cancel  out 𝒇(𝒕)𝒔𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕.  
So, here minus 𝒇(𝟎) is function at time 𝒕=𝟎, if the function has any value at time 𝑡=0 it will 
come otherwise, most functions will be 0. So, this term will disappear then 𝒔∫𝒇(𝒕)𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎. 
So, this is your 𝑠 times ; 𝑠 is coming from here. So, this thing is your 𝒇̅(𝒔), this whole thing is 
here 𝒇̅(𝒔). So, that I write −𝒇(𝟎)+𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔). So, transform of derivative , first derivative is 
−𝒇(𝟎)+𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔). Second derivative si milarly, you can do this exercise at home, if you derive it 
another time it would be 𝒔𝟐𝒇̅(𝒔)−𝒔𝒇(𝟎)−𝒇′(𝟎), which means the derivative of the function 
at time 𝒕=𝟎. Go to higher order 𝒅𝒏𝒇(𝒕)
𝒅𝒕𝒏 and 𝒔𝒏𝒇̅(𝒔)−𝒔𝒏−𝟏𝒇(𝟎)−𝒔𝒏−𝟐𝒇′(𝟎)……−
𝒔𝒇𝒏−𝟐(𝟎)−𝒇𝒏−𝟏(𝟎).  
(Refer Slide Time: 6:57)  
 
Transforms of integrals, transform of integrals means, we are taking the integration of 𝒇(𝒕)𝒅𝒕 
from 0 to t . There it is 0 to infinity ; here it is 0 to t. So, again we go to that integration by parts 
∫𝒇(𝒕)𝒅𝒕𝒕
𝟎 that is u ; would define this quantity  as as 𝒖 and this is my 𝒅𝒗. So, 𝒖𝒅𝒗 if I take it is 
v u v will come v is this quantity u is this quantity. So, this is  𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔∫𝒇(𝒕)𝒅𝒕𝒕
𝟎 and this is 
𝟏
𝒔∫𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒇(𝒕)𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎 that is 𝑣 𝑑 𝑢, v is this and u is this.  
So, this thing if I apply the limits it comes out as 𝟏
𝒔𝒇(𝟎)+𝟏
𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔). So, 𝟏
𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔). So, this is an 
important derivation ; you see the pattern if you go with derivative you get 𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔); derivative is 
𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔) and integration is 𝟏
𝒔𝒇̅(𝒔) because it is just a n opposite operation. The derivation means 
you are taking slope of the line or slope of the function and integration means you are taking 
area under the curve. So, integration Laplace transform will generate an 𝑠 in denominator 
derivative will generate s i n the numerator .  
(Refer Slide Time: 8:27)  
 
So, here is a Box function, Box function means it is ramp ; first goes like this , it goes up , holds 
and then it comes down . The distance is same A here, A hear, A here. So, 𝒇̅(𝒔)=∫𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒕𝒅𝒕𝑨
𝟎, 
𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒕𝒅𝒕 because this is ramp function , here the function is t, A this way A this way. So, slope 
is 1 so, ∫𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒕𝒅𝒕𝑨
𝟎−∫ 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒕𝒅𝒕𝟑𝑨
𝟐𝑨. Going d own. For this note that it is important the limit says 
0 to 𝑨 and 𝟐𝑨 to 𝟑𝑨, nothing here because the function has gone up and then hold steady.  
So, nothing comes here then this thing comes here 𝟐𝑨 to 𝟑𝑨 limits will decide that how long 
this conti nued you held the function for 𝟏𝑨, so 𝑨 to 2𝑨. So, now, it is your integration rules 
−𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒕
𝒔|
𝟎𝑨
+𝟏
𝒔∫𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕𝑨
𝟎+𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒕
𝒔|
𝟐𝑨𝟑𝑨
−𝟏
𝒔∫𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕𝟑𝑨
𝟐𝑨.  
Then it is just algebra you go like  
−𝒆−𝒔𝑨𝑨
𝒔−𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔𝟐|
𝟎𝑨
+𝒆−𝟑𝒔𝑨𝟑𝑨
𝒔−𝒆−𝟐𝒔𝑨𝟐𝑨
𝒔+(𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔𝟐)
𝟐𝑨𝟑𝑨
 
So, this goes like this here, this you have to work it out at home and see that these values are 
matching  Fnal expression is this  
=𝑨𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔[𝟑𝒆−𝟐𝒔𝑨−𝟐𝒆−𝒔𝑨−𝟏]+𝟏
𝒔𝟐(𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨−𝒆−𝟐𝒔𝑨+𝒆−𝟑𝒔𝑨) 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:33)  
 
Now, this is Triangular function. Triangular function is no holding ; the box is not there, so, I 
have got this going to ram p up, up to a ramp down up to 2 A. So, here the same thing, but the 
limits are different 𝑨 to 2𝑨; that was 2𝑨 to 3𝑨 this is 𝑨 to 2𝑨. So, again same thing goes on 
you have to follow this by doing otherwise you will not be able to do it  if it is given in  the 
exam. So, (𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔)(𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔−𝟐𝑨𝒆−𝒔𝑨). So (𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨)[𝟏
𝒔𝟐−𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔(𝟏
𝒔+𝟐𝑨)].  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:15)  
 
So, review of Laplace transform ; and here is a table that gives Laplace transform of almost all 
relevant functions. This is by no means an exhaustive table. It is average table ; basically it is 
an average table from bigger table available  in mathematical handbook . So, we start with 𝜹𝑨(𝒕), 
which is unit pulse function, this is unit pulse function. So, Laplace unit pulse function means 
that the function has a box type of arrangement, the width is 𝑨 and the height is 1/𝑨. So, if you 
multiply width times heigh t, the area will be unit 1. So, that is why it is called unit pulse 
function and this pulse because it goes up stays there and then comes back. Laplace transform 
of that is 𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔𝑨. s is your complex variable that is part of  the Laplace transform, all Laplace 
transforms are Laplace of any function time bound function is given as 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒇(𝒕)𝒅𝒕 integrated 
from 0 to infinity.  
So, this is the definition of Laplace transform. So, once we apply that to the pulse function, we 
get this as a result 𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨
𝒔𝑨. Then you have 𝜹𝟎(𝒕) which is unit impulse function, which is the 
same pulse function which has a width  A has become 0 and infinity has become the height. So, 
that is the unit impulse function, impulse function is very nearly described by a spike, in 
electrical circuit when you have a spike that is your unit impulse which means it the width 
approaches 0 and the height approaches infinite. Laplace transform such is one, unity, if you 
take this thing and you apply L'Hospitals rule where a goes to 0 you will get this thing.  
So, that is the Laplace transform unit impulse function. Then you have step function, step 
function means the function remains 0 and then at one in stant it reaches some value five, ten, 
twenty, one Anything. So, step function if I take a unit this is this height we take as one unit. 
Then Laplace transform is 𝟏𝒔⁄ if this one unit is five unit, then it will be 𝟓𝒔⁄. So, Laplace 
transform step f unction is 𝟏𝒔⁄.  
Then √𝒕. It is a bit cumbersome to find out the Laplace transform of √𝒕, but it can be done with 
a little bit of mastery over calculus, integral calculus. So, the Laplace transform is √𝝅
𝟐 𝟏
𝒔√𝒔. Then 
you have ramp function, this is ramp function 𝑡; it has a slope of 1, it can also have a slope of 
𝐴. The ramp function Laplace transform will be 𝟏
𝒔𝟐⁄. If slope is A then it will be 𝑨
𝒔𝟐⁄. So, 
that is the ramp function Laplac e transform  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:35)   
Then you go to 𝒕𝟐. If it is square of t , curve looks like this ; it goes to very high value after a 
while. So, 𝒕𝟐 Laplace transform is 𝟐!
𝒔𝟑. Then 𝒕𝒏, that is much further rise much steeper rise to 
the power n ; so Laplace transform of that is 𝒏!
𝒔𝒏+𝟏. 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 is 𝟏
𝒔+𝒂, it is a decaying function if 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 
means the function is decaying and Laplace transform that is 𝟏
𝒔+𝒂. 
Now, you combine 𝒕𝒏 and 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 here, then you get a combination of this and this , 𝒏! in numerator 
and (𝒔+𝒂)𝒏+𝟏 in the denomina tor. So, the function will look like this it will rise first and then 
it will decay down which means 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 prevails after some time and before it is too larger time 
period the 𝒕𝒏 prevails. So, it goes up. So, it is like a b ell shaped curve . 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕 is 𝝎
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐, 
sinusoidal function starting from 0.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:55)  
 
Then you have 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕, 𝒔
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐. 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕 is same sinusoidal function but it starts from one. At 
time 𝑡=0 it has a value of 1 whereas, for 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕 function , time 𝑡=0  it has a value 0. Then 
hyperbole function : 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝒉𝒂𝒕 which is 𝒆𝒂𝒕−𝒆−𝒂𝒕
𝟐. 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝒉𝒂𝒕 Laplace transform is 𝒂
𝒔𝟐−𝒂𝟐 and this is 
the function 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝒉𝒂𝒕, is steeply rising, 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝒉𝒂𝒕 the same thing steeply rising but it starts from 
1 whereas here it starts from 0. So, 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝒉𝒂𝒕 is 𝒆𝒂𝒕+𝒆−𝒂𝒕
𝟐. So, 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝒉𝒂𝒕 is 𝒔
𝒔𝟐−𝒂𝟐. 
𝒆−𝒂𝒕𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕. So, 𝝎
(𝒔+𝒂)𝟐+𝝎𝟐. 𝒆−𝒂𝒕𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕 is 𝒔+𝒂
(𝒔+𝒂)𝟐+𝝎𝟐. Both are decaying , see, because of 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 
factor both are decaying after a while it will decay down, now no problem of instability  here.  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:10)  
 
𝒆𝒃𝒕𝐬𝐢𝐧𝒉𝒂𝒕 is 𝒂
(𝒔−𝒃)𝟐−𝒂𝟐. 𝒆𝒃𝒕𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝒉𝒂𝒕 is 𝒔−𝒃
(𝒔−𝒃)𝟐−𝒂𝟐.

So, Laplace transform is a handy tool for the solution of ordinary differential equations with 
constant coefficients. Real Time variables are transformed into complex plane to obtain 
algebraic relationships. Thank you.
