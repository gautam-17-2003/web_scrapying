First Order Instruments  
Hello, we a re going to continue our discussion with first order instruments, this is module two, 
lecture five. So, instrumentation, we have started covering the first order instrument, the liquid in 
glass thermometer. And we have seen how it behaves when you have step input . We have discusse d 
that times constant should be small for liquid in glass thermometer,  then it can follow the 
disturbance very closely , without much deviation.  
Now, we wi ll see for the ramp input, when the temperature is going up continuously , can the 
thermometer track t his temperature change accurately?   
(Refer Slide Time: 01:13)  
 
So, this is a Laplace equation .  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:17)  
 
 
We come from here , ramp input 𝝉𝒅𝒙𝟎
𝒅𝒕+𝒙𝟎=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊 =𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝒕. Here 𝑲𝑻̇𝒊 is 𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝒕. That is , 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔 is dot is 
the slope of the ramp. So, taking Laplace transform , we get 𝝉𝒔𝒙𝟎̅̅̅+𝒙𝟎̅̅̅=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔
𝒔𝟐. So, simplifying 
(𝝉𝒔+𝟏) 𝒙𝟎̅̅̅=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔
𝒔𝟐. So,  𝒙𝟎̅̅̅ we can rearrange and it becomes  𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝑨
𝒔𝟐+𝑩
𝒔+𝑪
𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄). Generally, 
whatever is the denominator th at can b e split into each function of 𝑠. See, we have the denominator 
on the left hand side , 𝒔𝟐 multiplied by 𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄. So, that has been split as 𝑨
𝒔𝟐+𝑩
𝒔+𝑪
𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄. So, 𝐴,𝐵,𝐶 
have to be determined. So, 𝑨
𝒔𝟐+𝑩
𝒔+𝑪
𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄ can be written as in the right hand side . 
𝑨(𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄)+𝑩𝒔(𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄)+𝑪𝒔𝟐
𝒔𝟐(𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄). Then this is equal to  𝟏𝝉⁄, because the whole numera tor, you go back and 
see, the whole  numerator is just having  𝟏𝝉⁄, i.e.,  𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝉⁄. So, 𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔 if I keep outside , that is the 
forcing function then  𝟏𝝉⁄ is the nu merator. So, that is what is equated here . 𝑨(𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄)+
𝑩𝒔(𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄)+𝑪𝒔𝟐 is 𝟏𝝉⁄. So, equating 𝒔𝟐 term, we do  not have anything there. So, 𝑩+𝑪=𝟎, 
then 𝑨+𝑩𝝉⁄=𝟎 and 𝑨𝝉⁄=𝟏𝝉⁄. Only the 𝒔𝟎 term remains. So, that is why 𝑨𝝉⁄=𝟏𝝉⁄. So,  𝑪 
becomes  +𝝉, 𝑩 becomes −𝝉 and A becomes 1 . So,  𝒙𝟎̅̅̅=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝟏
𝒔𝟐−𝝉
𝒔+𝝉
𝒔+𝟏𝝉⁄). Taking inverse 
Laplace transform 𝒙𝟎=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝒕−𝝉+𝝉𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄).  
This inverse Laplace transform we have to get used to by h andling the  ready reckoner  or the 
Laplace transform table . The Laplace transform table will give you quick reference how to get the 
inverse Laplace transform to get the function , real time function. So, the last line on this slide is 
the real time function . And the line before that is the Laplace transfor m of that. So, we are getting 
𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝒕−𝝉+𝝉𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄).  (Refer Slide Time: 04:29)  
 
Measurement error 𝒆𝒎=𝑻𝒊−𝒙𝟎
𝑲. Here, 𝑻𝒊 is the tank temperature and 𝒙𝟎
𝑲 is the temperature 
indicated by the liquid in g lass thermometer. So, we write , 𝑻𝒊 is  𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝒕 and 𝒙𝟎
𝑲 is 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝒕−𝝉+𝝉𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄). 
So, 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝒕 cance l out, positive and negative. I am left with 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝉−𝝉𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄. So, this is equal to 
𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝉−𝝉𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄. The first term is steady state error , 𝒆𝒎,𝒔𝒔 and the seco nd term  is transient error 
𝒆𝒎,𝒕. Transient error means , it is going to change . As t becomes larg e 𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄ term becomes very 
small. So, that can be taken out of the system. So, st eady st ate error is only the first term 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝉.  
So, 𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕  or 𝒆𝒎, i.e., the measurement error is 𝒆𝒎,𝒔𝒔−𝒆𝒎,𝒕, where  𝒆𝒎,𝒔𝒔 is your steady 
state error and 𝒆𝒎,𝒕 is transient. So, 𝒆𝒎
𝒆𝒎,𝒔𝒔= 𝟏−𝒆𝒎,𝒕
𝒆𝒎,𝒔𝒔, which is 𝟏−𝒆−𝒕𝝉⁄. So, 𝝉 must be small to 
keep 𝒆𝒎
𝒆𝒎,𝒔𝒔 unity at a short time .  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:05)  
 
Sinusoidal input , let us see how it behaves . 𝑻𝒊=𝑻𝒊𝒔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕. 
𝝉𝒅𝒙𝟎
𝒅𝒕+𝒙𝟎=𝑲𝑻𝒊𝒔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕  
Taking Laplace transform, we get 𝝉𝒔𝒙𝟎̅̅̅(𝒔)+𝒙𝟎̅̅̅(𝒔)=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝎
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐. And (𝝉𝒔+𝟏)𝒙𝟎̅̅̅(𝒔)=
𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝎
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐. Here 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔 is depicted here ; this is the input function, which is 𝑻̇𝒊𝒔 is the peak and then 
𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕 is the  oscillation. So, 𝒙𝟎̅̅̅(𝒔)=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝎
𝒔𝟐+𝝎𝟐 𝟏
(𝝉𝒔+𝟏)=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔𝝎/𝝉
(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)(𝒔−𝒋𝝎) 𝟏
(𝒔+𝟏/𝝉). Here 𝒔𝟐+
𝝎𝟐 can be broken down into (𝒔+𝒋𝝎)(𝒔−𝒋𝝎), because 𝒔 is nothing but 𝑨+𝒋𝑩. So, it is a 
complex plane , where the variable s is having real and imaginary portion. So, multiplied by  𝟏
(𝒔+𝟏/𝝉).  
So, partial fr actions, what we have learned so  far? That partial fraction means in denominator 
whatever factors are there, each can be taken separately with a constant in the numerator. So, we 
have 𝒙𝟎̅̅̅(𝒔)=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝑨
(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)+𝑩
(𝒔−𝒋𝝎)+𝑪
(𝒔+𝟏/𝝉)).  
(Refer Slide Time: 07:52)  
 
So, simplifying  𝝎/𝝉
(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)(𝒔−𝒋𝝎)(𝒔+𝟏/𝝉) =𝑨
(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)+𝑩
(𝒔−𝒋𝝎)+𝑪
(𝒔+𝟏/𝝉). Multiplying both sides by  (𝒔+
𝒋𝝎), I am  setting 𝒔=−𝒋𝝎. That is  𝒔+𝒋𝝎=𝟎, then 𝒔=−𝒋𝝎. So, 𝑨=𝝎/𝝉
−𝟐𝒋𝝎 (𝟏
𝝉−𝒋𝝎). Other term s 
vanish , because 𝐵 I am multiplying by 𝒔+𝒋𝝎 and 𝒔=−𝒋𝝎 so, that is 0. C is also 0. Here A  
remains b ecause A is the denominator 𝒔+𝒋𝝎 and I a m mul tiplying also by 𝒔+𝒋𝝎, so, A remains . 
So, 𝑨=𝝎/𝝉
−𝟐𝒋𝝎 (𝟏
𝝉−𝒋𝝎).  
So, 𝟏
𝟐(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)=(𝒋−𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)(𝒋−𝝎𝝉). Whenever there is 𝒋 term in the denominator , we want to get rid of it 
from the denominator, because 𝒋 in the numerator can be handled as complex , as imaginary  
variable. So, this thing goes to the numerator (𝒋−𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐). So, 𝒋 is there , we can separate it out as 
𝒋
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)−𝝎𝝉
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐). That is  𝒋 coefficient is imaginary and  the 𝝎𝝉 term is real. So, multiply both 
sides by 𝒔−𝒋𝝎 and set 𝒔=𝒋𝝎. So, 𝑩=𝝎/𝝉
𝟐𝒋𝝎(𝟏
𝝉+𝒋𝝎). Simplifying again, we get  −𝟏
𝟐(𝒋−𝝎𝝉). So, 
(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)(𝒋−𝝎𝝉)=−(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)   . So, here j i s the imaginary axis, so, there  the coefficient is  −𝟏
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐). 
So, that is your imaginary variable . And the real variable is 𝝎𝝉
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐). Lastly, we have multiplied  
both sides by (𝒔+𝟏/𝝉). And we set 𝒔=−𝟏/𝝉. So, this was solved as  𝑪=𝝎/𝝉
(𝒋𝝎−𝟏/𝝉)(𝒋𝝎+𝟏/𝝉)=
𝝎/𝝉
(𝝎𝟐+𝟏/𝝉𝟐)=𝝎𝝉
(𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐+𝟏).  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:51)  
 
So, we subst itute the values of the three coefficients, and we get:  
 𝒙𝟎̅̅̅(𝒔)=𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔((𝒋−𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)
(𝒔+𝒋𝝎)−(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)
(𝒔−𝒋𝝎)+𝝎𝝉
(𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐+𝟏)
(𝒔+𝟏/𝝉))   
So, taking inverse Laplace transform , go to your table and see, if (𝒔+𝒂) is in the denomin ator, 
what is the inverse Laplace transform ? It is  𝒆−𝒂𝒕. So, here also we have the numerator remaining 
as it is , (𝒋−𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐). And (𝒔+𝒋𝝎) shows up as inverse  𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕. Second term , same thing , 
(𝒋+𝝎𝝉)
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕. And last term, 𝝎𝝉
(𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐+𝟏)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉. So, this we rearrange and we finally get  
𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(−𝒋
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)(𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕−𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)−𝝎𝝉
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)(𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕+𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)+𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉). That is 𝒋 is minus 
because you are having 𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕 as the fir st term. So, we take it to the second term and the minus 
sign comes before . And  last term is 𝝎𝝉
𝟐(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉. So, next line 𝑲𝑻̇𝒊𝒔(𝟏
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)sin𝝎𝒕−
𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)cos𝝎𝒕+𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉). This (𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕−𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)
𝟐𝒋 is the definition  of 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕 and (𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕+𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)
𝟐 is the 
definition of  𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕, i.e.,  𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕 is (𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕−𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)
𝟐𝒋. And 𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕 t is (𝒆𝒋𝝎𝒕+𝒆−𝒋𝝎𝒕)
𝟐. The last term is 
𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉. So, that is equal to  𝑲𝑻𝒊𝒔
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)(sin𝝎𝒕−𝝎𝝉cos𝝎𝒕+𝝎𝝉𝒆−𝒕/𝝉). 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:29)  
 
 
So, here i s a little substitution that will ease our calculation from now on . Let 𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧𝜽=𝒑 ,   and 
𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝜽=𝒒. So, r  is then √𝒑𝟐+𝒒𝟐 and 𝜽=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏𝒑
𝒒. So, using this we can say 𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝜽+𝑨)=
𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧𝜽𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝑨+𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝜽𝐬𝐢𝐧𝑨=𝒔𝒊𝒏 𝝎𝒕−𝝎𝝉𝒄𝒐𝒔 𝝎𝒕. So, 𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝑨=𝟏 and 𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒏 𝑨=−𝝎𝝉. 
Because you  go back to the equation that we had , that is  𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕−𝝎𝝉𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕+𝝎𝝉𝒆−𝒕/𝝉. So, here 
𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝜽+𝑨)=𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧𝜽𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝑨+𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝜽𝐬𝐢𝐧𝑨. Since my equation is 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕−𝝎𝝉𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕, so, this is 
𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝜽 is equal to  1 and 𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧𝜽 is equal to −𝝎𝝉. So, 𝒓=√𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐 and 𝑨=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉). So, 
this becomes 𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝝎𝒕+𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉))=√𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝝎𝒕+𝝋). Here, 𝝋=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉) 
and 𝒙𝟎(𝒕)=𝑲𝑻𝒊𝒔(𝟏
√𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝝎𝒕+𝝋)+𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉). 
So, this is −𝝎, this term was missing here , −𝝎𝝉. So, 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕−𝝎𝝉𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕, that goes to 
𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝜽+𝑨)=𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧𝜽𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝑨+𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝜽𝐬𝐢𝐧𝑨. So, 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝝎𝒕−𝝎𝝉𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝝎𝒕 is actually  𝒓𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝝎𝒕+
𝒑𝒉𝒂𝒔𝒆  𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 ). So, the phase angle is 𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉) and it comes as √𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝝎𝒕+𝝋).  
So, 𝒙𝟎(𝒕)=𝑲𝑻𝒊𝒔(𝟏
√𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐sin(𝝎𝒕+𝝋)+𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉). That is because this thing here 𝜽 is 
𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏𝒑
𝒒. So, 𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏𝒑
𝒒 means , since 𝒓𝐜𝐨𝐬 𝑨=𝟏 and 𝒓𝒔𝒊𝒏 𝑨=−𝝎𝝉. So, that is 𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉).  (Refer Slide Time: 16:30)  
 
Now, we give  an example to show us that how this instrument liquid in glass thermometer behaves 
when we put it to test for a sinusoidal input . A mercury thermometer having a time constant of 0.1 
minute is placed in a temperature bath at 50 °C is allowed to come to equilibrium with the bath . 
At time t is equal to 0 the temperature of th e bath begins to vary sinusoidally about 50 degrees 
Celsius with an amplitude of plus or minus  2 degrees Celsius.  If the frequency of oscillation is 
10/π cycles/min , plot the ul timate response of thermometer reading as a function of time , what is 
the phase lag?  
So, 𝝉=𝟎.𝟏 minute is given, 𝑻𝒊𝒔 is given a s 2 °C. The am plitude of the oscillation is 2  degree , 2 
degree positive 2 degree negative . So, 50 plus  2 is 52 and 50 minus  2 is 48 . 𝟐𝝅𝒇 =𝟐𝝅𝟏𝟎
𝝅=
𝟐𝟎 𝒓𝒂𝒅  𝒎𝒊𝒏−𝟏. And 𝑲=𝟏𝟎−𝟑𝒎𝑲−𝟏. Amplitude of response at steady state is  
𝑲𝑻𝒊𝒔
√𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐=𝟏𝟎−𝟑×𝟐
√𝟏+𝟒𝟎𝟎 ×𝟎.𝟎𝟏=𝟎.𝟖𝟗𝟒 ×𝟏𝟎−𝟑𝒎.  
So, you can take it as millimeter which means, 1 millimeter is per degree Celsius if that is th e 
sensitivity, then it is 0. 894 degree that is the maximum amplitude of the thermometer reading  when 
the input is actually plus or minus  2 degree.  
 So, 𝝋=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉)=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝟐𝟎×𝟎.𝟏)=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝟐)=−𝟔𝟑.𝟒 °. So, that is your phase lag , =
−𝟔𝟑.𝟒 °. The respo nse of  the thermometer is 𝟎.𝟖𝟗𝟒 ×𝟏𝟎−𝟑𝐬𝐢𝐧(𝟐𝟎𝒕 −𝟔𝟑.𝟒°). Response of the 
thermometer in °C is 𝟎.𝟖𝟗𝟒 (𝟐𝟎𝒕 −𝟔𝟑.𝟒°)=𝟎.𝟖𝟗𝟒 (𝟐𝟎𝒕 −𝟏.𝟏𝟎𝟔𝟓 )𝐫𝐚𝐝   = 𝟎.𝟖𝟗𝟒 (𝟎.𝟑𝟑𝟑𝒕 −
𝟏.𝟏𝟎𝟔𝟓 ). This we are doing in second, in the 20𝑡, it was radian per minute . Now, we are doing 
it radian per second. So, that is 0.333 t minus 1.1065 in second , 0.1065 radian  that is 63.4 degree 
𝟏𝟎
𝝅 cycle is  1 minute so,  1 cycle is 𝝅
𝟏𝟎×𝟔𝟎 seconds is 18.85 seconds. So, phase lag in second is 
63.4
360×18.85, that is 3.32 seconds. So, 18.85 second is the time period of oscillation and 3.32 
second is the phase lag.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:41)  
 
 
Now, we calculate using the formula . The form ula which you have used is this thing  𝒙𝟎(𝒕)=
𝑲𝑻𝒊𝒔(𝟏
√𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐sin(𝝎𝒕+𝝋)+𝝎𝝉
(𝟏+𝝎𝟐𝝉𝟐)𝒆−𝒕/𝝉). And 𝝋=𝐭𝐚𝐧−𝟏(−𝝎𝝉). So, using this we get 
these values . We calculate for t, this is t ; here t goes from 0 ,1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 
30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 4 5, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60. And then 𝒕/𝝉 for 𝝉=𝟎.𝟏 minute. So, 0.1  minute mean 
six seconds . So, 1.5 is one fourth, 3 is half , 4.5 is  3 quarter and six is  1, 1 𝝉. So, 𝒕/𝝉 we get , then 
𝟎.𝟖𝒆−𝒕/𝝉  is the error that , transient error term . If you go back t wo slides, you will get this is the 
transi ent. This is your transient error , this thing is the transient error term because it has 𝒆−𝒕/𝝉. And 
𝒆−𝒕/𝝉 term we have seen in the, this step function that if 𝒕/𝝉 is 𝝋, this thing becomes negligible.  
So, we have , you see that 𝟎.𝟖𝒆−𝒕/𝝉, this is going smaller smaller smaller and here it is completely 
negligible. Then you have total 𝟎.𝟖𝟗𝟒  𝑺𝒊𝒏(𝟎.𝟑𝟑𝒕 −𝟏.𝟏𝟏). Where those values are calculated , 
they are here . And totally add this and this , this is 0 then this is positive . Everything is positive 
until here then negative , negative , negative , positive an d rounded ; 0.107 is rounded to 0.1, 0. 378 
is rounded to 0.4 ; 0.705 is to 0. 7.   
(Refer Slide Time: 22:14)  
 
So, that way we go and we see this result if we plot this is how it looks. So, you see  the orange 
line is your 𝑻𝒊, input function , and the 𝑻𝒕𝒍 is your response of the thermometer . See this input is  up 
to 2 degree , 2 degree temperature is amplitude, but this is coming not more than 1.4 or 1.5, let us 
say. So, that means it cannot cover 0.5 degree here and this is your phase lag.  
See this shifting , this is shifting like this phase lag , phase lag , phase lag , phase lag something like 
that. So, thermometer is a good instrument for step function it can duplicate the step function 
disturbance very closel y if the time constant is small. B ut even if the time cons tant is small, the 
thermometer is not an ideal instrument to replicate a sinusoidal input function . It will miss it by 
0.5 out of  2 which means about  25 percent ; 25 percent  will be the error .  (Refer Slide Time: 23:29)  
 
Another example , a mercury thermometer having a time constant of five seconds placed in a 
temperature bath at 50 degrees Celsius is allowed to come to equilibrium with the bath . At time t 
is equal to 0 the temperature of the bath begins to vary sinusoidally about 50 degre es Celsius with 
an amplitude of plus or minus  3 degrees Celsius. If the frequency of oscillation is  12/π cycles per 
minute, plot the ultimat e response of the thermometer reading  as a function of time , what is the 
phase lag ?  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:00)  
 
Same problem with different numbers. So , we calculate similar way .  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:04)  
 
And then we plot , see here the thing to notice that it is coming from a t time t is equal to 0 it is 
having a negative value . And then it came , picks up and the n it follows the oscillation.
