Introduction to Process Control  
Hello everybody! We are going to start the new online course ‚ÄúInstrumentation and Process 
Control in Food Industry‚Äù. This is an eight -week course, so about 20 hours of lecture. Today, 
we start with module one, lecture 1, which is an introduction to process  control. I am A. K 
Datta, I work in the Agricultural and Food Engineering Department at IIT Kharagpur.

Now, in this session, we are going to cover these concepts:  
‚Ä¢ Purpose of instruments: we use instruments, but sometimes we ar e not very sure what is 
the exact objective of the instruments‚Äô use. So, we will look into the different uses of 
instruments for scientific purposes.  
‚Ä¢ Then we have functional elements of an instrument: how does an instrument actually 
measure or indicate the  variable exactly as we want them to.  
‚Ä¢ There are some examples that will be covered here, like pasteurizer control, temperature 
control for dryer, and water tank temperature control. The title of the course is 
instrumentation and process control in the food  industry. So, these examples are from the 
food industry. So, we will see how these cases actually fit into our scheme of things.  
‚Ä¢ And then lastly, we will go to operational amplifiers, which are basically the building 
blocks of any control process. So, we will look into that also.  
(Refer Slide Time: 02:08)  
 
So, the purpose of instruments, as I was saying that we are not always sure about the purpose 
or objective of the instruments. Here we have given three areas: monitor, control and analyse. 
To ‚ÄúMonitor‚Äù  the processes and operations means that loosely when we use instruments, we 
generally mean that we are going to measure something. So, that ‚Äúmeasure something‚Äù is an 
indicator of how the process or operation is going.  
Say if I have a reactor, what is the  temperature of the reactor in a steady -state condition. If we 
measure that, then we can tell that this is the steady -state temperature of the reactor. Then once 
the monitoring part is over, we want feedback. The monitor variable will be given to the 
contr oller. So, if there is a large deviation in the set value and the controller output, then the 
error signal between the measured variable and the set value will decide how the process and 
operation should be altered to control the process.  
And lastly, we a nalyse the processes and experiments. To ‚ÄúAnalyse‚Äù a process and experiments 
means that we are not very sure about what kind of experiment result we are going to get, we 
try to measure certain variables, and from that, we judge how the process of the exper iment is 
going. So, analysis of processes and experiments is the third dimension of instruments‚Äô use; 
monitoring is the first objective. Loosely when we say we are going to use instruments, we 
mean that we want to monitor processes and operations.  
Second is we feedback that monitored variable to the controller, and then the controller varies 
the process and operation parameters. And finally, the analysis part is mainly for processing 
and experiments where we do not know much; it may be a groundbreaking are a or research 
objective, something like that. We analyse the process from the major variable.  
So, the processes operations are: typical thermometers, barometers, anemometers. They 
monitor the environment. A thermometer is for temperature, a barometer is for pressure, an 
anemometer is for air velocity; these we are familiar with. So, these are the best example of 
simple instruments. Then water, diesel, and electric metres measure the quantity consumed. 
Whenever we want to measure the flow rate  of water, diesel or petrol for that matter, electric 
metres, energy metres, kilowatt -hour metres, these measure the quantity consumed.  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:09)  
 
So, the second objective of the instruments is the control of processes and operations, let us 
look at this block diagram and sort of get an idea of how the controlling of process operations 
are carried out. Here we have input energy or material ; how much energy w e are putting or 
how much material we are taking in that is the input of the system . Then we have  the process 
here. The process does something . Say input energy : if I am putting something like , say one 
kilowatt -hour energy, then how much heating action I c an get, the process will decide  that, 
depending on what instrument or what equipment we are using.  
So, after the input energy and material enters the process, what comes out is the output of the 
process. So, that is the control variable. So, this control variable goes to the instrument, i.e., 
feedback  or start up the feedback process. The c ontrol variable is measured by the instrument , 
and the instrument gives a measured variable to the controller , and the controller gives a 
manipulated variable . We will e xplain what is measured variable , what is manipulated variable  
in the next slide.  
So, the measured variable goes to the controller , and the controller gives manipulated variable, 
which is some alteration of the variable say, if I am a measuring temperatur e, I may convert it 
to millivolt signal or milliampere signal. So, that is the manipulated variable . If the temperature 
is high, I may get up to a maximum of 20 milliampere current, so that will be the manipulated 
variable.  
Then the 20 milliampere current  will go to the final control element . The final control element 
will probably increase the heat input to the system . How? Because there will be some resistance 
capacitance with electric circuit there, which will operate under the value of the manipulated 
variable. So, the final control element will give the variable  feedback to the process and error 
in the system , 
ùúÄ=ùêº‚àíùêπ 
 ùêº is the input energy or material , and the variable  feedback is ùêπ.  
So, I minus F is the error. Now, if the process is running exactly as we want it to , ùêº‚àíùêπ will be 
0, there will be no error, but that does not happen . There is always variability in the process. 
So, actually , what would we gain from the feedback is the error signal , and the error signal will 
have to be co ntrolled in such a way that it reduces the error for the next step.  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:16)   
So, the third objective of the instruments is engineering analysis . Engineering analysis require s 
theoretical and experimental solutions to engineering problems . The proportion of theory to 
experiment depends on the nature of the problem . Frontier areas or research efforts depend 
more on experimentations based on instrumental interpretation.  
So, rese arch and frontier areas are the domain s where experimentation and instrumental 
interpretation is very important because we do not know exactly what we are going to find out . 
We have to measure different variables ; we have to use instrument s to measure /indicate 
different variables and then infer from that how the process is going.  
(Refer Slide Time: 09:08)  
 
So, here are the functional elements of an instrument.  As I was saying , the manipulated variable 
and the actual measuring variable are different ; these  are examples . A particular example is, 
say, I have a medium ; medium means it could be air, it could be water, it could be some fruit 
juice or something like tha t. I want to measure some parameter . Say I want to measure pressure ; 
the example here is given for pressure.  
So, if I want to measure the pressure, then the primary sensing element is generally a strain 
gauge . Pressure is measured by something like a diaphragm , a very thin, typically thin 
aluminium diaphragm on which a resistance element or strain gauge is mounted. Now , as the 
pressure increases, there is bending of the diaphragm . Since the diaphragm is thin, it will bend , 
and as it bends, it will change the length of the strain gauge , and as length changes, the 
resistance of the strain gauge  will also change.  
So, if I have a voltage supply, DC volt supply across that strain gauge , that voltage will vary. 
Generally , it is not that simple ; we cannot just have a strain gauge and measure the voltage 
varying . Strain gauges are always part of Whea tstone bridge , and I am not sure if you are 
familiar with that Wheatstone bridge ; it is basically a forearm bridge, where three arms are 
fixed and one arm is your measuring resistance.  
So, once the resistance changes, because of pressure applied on the di aphragm, then the bridge 
will be imbalanced and it will give an output,  a positive output voltage. So, primary sensing 
element for measuring pressure is strain gauge and the variable which we are altering is 
resistance , not necessarily the volume or the fo rce. It is resistance which will give us the 
approximate value of the pressure.  
Then we go to variable conversion element . Conversion means, we are getting  voltage or 
current out of the resistance. So, voltage changes means current will also change . Then we go 
to variable  manipulation element . Manipulation means, we want to amplify the signal . For 
example,  2 millivolt , 5 millivolt, 10 millivolt, 20 milliamperes are very small signal s and if 
your range is large, if your scale is large, then these are not enough to indicate small changes.  
So, we amplify ; 2 millivolt will be amplified to something like 5 volt, 10 milli ampere will be 
amplified to something like 2 ampere. So, the manipul ated variable will give the amplified 
signal which will go to the data transmission element . Here,  we are talking about instrument in 
food industry, but you have to keep in mind the same instrument is used in Space Science also . 
We are talking about food i ndustry measurement, but the same strain gauge pressure measurement is going on Mars surface or moon surface , and it is controlled from here on the 
earth.  
So, amplified signal goes to the data transmission element where we rely on digital signal 
transmiss ion because if you try to transmit analogue signal over a long distance , it gets 
distorted . The analogue signal is not reliable to maintain its sanctity . For example,  WiFi, i.e., 
wireless fidelity,  which  basically means that the signal is not altered, the original signal remains 
as such.  
So, that is why digital transmission is always relied upon, because once you convert it to binary 
0 and 1 , there is no question of any decay or any kind of loss . But if you try to transmit 2 
millivolt,  this 2 millivolt wil l become 1.8 milli volt or maybe 2.3 million or something like 
that. So that is why binary transmission or digital transmission is relied upon . 
Then you have data storage playback element. Data storage means you have to store it 
someplace , either in a computer or in a desk , and this will play back. So, finally we have data 
conversion element and that will give  the observer the pressure . Data conversion means it is 
being converted back from the digital signal to the stored data and the stored data will show 
you the pressure based on calibration. See, I have five 5 bar pressure and that gives me 
something like say 10 millivolt signal.  
So, 10 millivolt signal goes to digital, then di gital form 100110 something like that, that will 
go to the data storage and the storage will convert back based on the calibration, so that you 
get to see not the 5 millivolt ; you get to see that 5 bar pressure . That is the observer ‚Äôs interest, 
he does not  really want what the millivolt or milliampere signal is there. He is studying the 
pressure of the system.  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:52)   
So, let us move on temperature control for dryer. This needs a little bit explanation, you see 
here I have a dryer and a heater . The h eater is actually carrying current to heat the air , which is 
coming in from the left side into the dryer . The heater is having an electrical heater, that will 
receive current and will heat up  the air.  Typically the dryer heaters are 30 kilowa tt, 20 kilowatt, 
50 kilowatt, something like that.  
So, the dry  air comes in, the heater heats it, then th is dry air enters the dryer where it is in a 
counter current system , which means that the air is going from left to right and the grain is 
coming from  the bottom and going from right to left. So, the most wet  grain which is entering 
the dryer meets the air which is almost exhausted , and then it is going out from the left side 
where dry grain it is meeting the hottest air.  
Moisture  is more difficult to remove  when the material is dry. So, that is why the dry grain is 
in contact with the hottest hot air and the wet grain is in contact with the coolest hot air. Coolest 
means they are b oth hot, but the relatively the left hand side is hotter than the right hand side.  
So, the air is moving left to right and the grain is moving right to left. So, moisture goes out ; 
that moisture is recycle d back to the heater , just to make sure that we do  not waste too much 
heat, because heater here is giving you dry hot air that hot air is picking up moisture and 
cooling. So part of it if you recycle, then we reduce that demand on the heater, the heater will 
not have to heat up as frequently if I did not do that.  
So, w et grain  is coming in, dry grain is going out . Here we have moisture metre . Moisture 
metres are based on resistance capacitance ; resistance and capacitance not together , but  
separately . Some moisture metres work on resistance of the grain, s ome moisture metre works 
on the principle of capacitance of the grain.  
So, that moisture metre signal will be amplified here and it will go to comparator . Comparator 
means it is a transistor base d device where a set point is given . I want the final grain moisture 
to be something like say 10  or 11 percent. Now, if the dryer is not doing the job properly 11 
percent moisture will go up to something like 12 or 13 percent , that is still very  good . But if it 
is 15 percent , we have to tackle that also. So,  if wet  grain comes out, the moisture metre will 
measure the moisture of this wet grain and resistance /capacitance of the washer of the grain 
will be part of a circuit where voltage or ampere will come out.  
So, that will amplify and it will go to the comparator,  comparator set point is positive and the 
measured signal is negative. So, if everything is working fine your dryer is giving moisture 
content of 11 percent as you wanted , heated temperature the dry air temperature is exactly 70 
or 65 degree as you want ed, then these two signals should be equal, comparator minus , set 
point plus, so no error signal nothing comes here.  
But suppose there is a difference ; difference means that moisture is not being removed 
adequately. So, 11 percent has become 13 percent so, i t reduces the capacitance . Capacitance 
reduction means voltage will increase , say , 2 millivolt . So, 2 millivolts ‚Äúplus‚Äù is when your 
moisture content has gone from say 11 percent to 13 percent.  
So, amplified signal will be 2 millivolt converted to somethi ng like say 10 volts  or 5 volts. So, 
that goes to the comparator and the set point is giving you a different value. For example,  
amplified signal is 5 volt , and  set point is something like 3 volts negative signal. So, 2 volt 
negative signal is here. So, th at error signal will go  through here to the heater , and the negative 
signal will make the heat and moisture is high.  
That means your heating capacity should be increased. So, this heating capacity will increase 
based on the heater you have, it will change  its kilowatt, which means there will be a circuit or 
additional circuit, where, this error signal will change the resistance of the circuit giving more 
ùêº2ùëÖ loss for the heater. So, that extra energy is transmitted to the dryer and the dryer gives it to 
the grain and the grain will lose the extra moisture.  
So, that is how it is operates; here you have the control, the actual control of the heater going 
up or down depending on either it is a plus 2 millivolt signal or it is a minus . This is just an example , plus 2 millivolt is not sacrosanct, it could be plus 5 millivolts it could be minus 10 
millivolt anything like that. So, those values will operate along thi s side to control the heated 
kilowatt.  (Refer Slide Time: 21:04)  
 
So, the next example we take is pasteurizer control . Pasteurizer is a very crucial treatment in 
milk channel. See , early morning we get our pouches in our home or get it from the market, 
those pouches have gone through very advanced process involving pasteurizer, because you 
will see on the pouch it is written that homogenised pasteurised milk. So, homogenization is 
basically an attempt to distribute the fat particles in the milk uniformly .  
That is done mainly to make sure that everybody gets that desired fat percentage in the milk 
and pasteurisation is to raise the temperature to a level where disease producing organisms are 
destroyed. So, pasteurisation is a very crucial treatment . If milk is not properly pasteurised, it 
will cause outbreak of disease , and it has happened many times and not just in poor countries 
like India or Mexico, Venezuela ; it has happened in Japan , it has happened in USA , it has 
happened in Europe , every place . Milk was not properly pasteurised , some fault in the system, 
the desired temperature was not reached. So, th at milk actually instead of giving nutrition to 
people who consumed it, g ave toxin which cause d death, 83 -85 people died from an infection 
in 1982 in Ja pan. So, these kind of things are very unfortunate. So, that is why pasteurisation 
is a very crucial step in processing of milk. So, let us look at it how we can make sure that 
pasteurisation has taken place properly.  
So, milk comes in from here, and then it is going this way. This is a three way valve . So, total 
three  three -way valve s are there. M ilk normally will come this way , go here and then go to the 
pasteurisation test, see this is after the milk has been raised to the desired temperature.  So, I 
am not showing the temperature device here. Here,  the milk  is coming from the pasteurizer 
going through these two valves and then going through phosphoric acid ester . Phosphoric acid 
ester is a chemical which turns the mi lk colour to blue if it has not reached the pasteurisation 
temperature , and if the milk has reached pasteurisation temperature it remains white. So, 
phosphoric acid ester is an indicator, which gives you an idea whether the milk has been 
pasteurised or not .  
So, milk comes here and here you have a pair of glass slide which will trap the milk in a very 
thin layer . You have light source. Now if the milk has been properly pasteurised , this thin layer 
of milk will actually transmit the light , which means it wil l be white light. So, it s luminance is 
large . But if it has not been pasteurised properly, the phosphoric acid ester will leave the milk 
blue. So, then it will be blue light. So, the photovoltaic cell will register the blue light which 
has less luminous th an the white light  and t hen milk goes out . Photovoltaic means it is 
converting the light to voltage. So the  data from photovoltaic cell goes to the amplifier , again 
for example  at +2 millivolt or ‚àí2 millivolts, then  gets amplifie d to 10 millivolt or 20 mil li volts , 
something like that . Then it goes to the comparator , which is  the negative terminal . There is 
also the positive terminal which is a set point . So, if there is a difference between the two 
terminals, that gives the error signal and depending on the error signal, if the milk has turned 
blue, this will send the signal to this point. So, what will happen is milk will not go to this way,  
it will return through this and go back here. So, that is how the pas teurisation is made sure that 
it is doing to job desired level.  (Refer Slide Time: 25:53)  
 
The last example of this control is water tank temperature control . This is the continuous ly 
stirred water tank, and the heater coil is in the tank . This heater c oil is heating the water and 
the water is coming from this point , ùêπ is the flow rate and ùëáùëñ is the temperature.  
Now, we are not doing anything to the flow, what we are doing is changing temperature . Say, 
normally water  is coming  in at 30 degrees Celsius into the tank and it is coming out from here 
at 40 degrees Celsius. So, heater coil gives additional 10 degree . That is the heat, additional 10 
degree here. So, the heater coil is controlled by the relay, the relay is controlled by the controller 
and the comparator.  
So, first feedback occurs at the water tank , which means that the temperature is sensed by an 
instrum ent; generally some resistance thermometer or thermistor  or thermocouple. They sense  
the temperature, send the signal . Again there is voltage  in order of  millivolt that is amplified . 
This amplified signal  goes to the negative terminal of the comparator where the positive 
terminal is the set point . In our example, I said that it is coming in at 30  ¬∞C and g oing out at 40  
¬∞C. So, that means  the set temperature ùëáùë† is at 40  ¬∞C. Let‚Äôs say the temperature of water reahces  
37, 38, 34 something like that , or it could be 42 , 43 ¬∞C  also if there  is more heat. So, there is a 
net difference between the positive and the negative values.  
So, the difference will go to the controller . If everything is working fine , water is  coming in at 
30 ¬∞C, the heater coil is operating  and water  is going out at 40  ¬∞C, then  there will be no 
difference between these two positive and negative. So, they will all be same. And generally 
the control action is not needed when these two values are same . Only when they deviate from 
the set value, then we have to have the control action.  
So, the comparator here will send the signal to the controller and the controller will send a 
signal to the relay . The operation of relay needs a little  careful observation . There is the heater 
coil inside the tank and this coil has an additional resistance here , and the relay here will actuate 
in such a way that this contact is made either here or here or here. I am showing three possible 
locations but but it is a ctually a  continuous contact process.  
The heating coil here is touched at either the middle or at the top or at the bottom . Where it is 
touching at the top, the rest of  this thing is taken out of the circuit. So, top means your electrical 
connection will be only t hrough this heating coil. So, this total circuit resistance is now less.  
So here, ùëá<ùëáùë†, which gives  +2 millivolt signal. So the resistance goes down, because you 
have taken out this resistance from the circuit. So, once you have taken this resistance o ut of 
the circuit, you go to the current which is increasing , and increase current means the relay goes 
up and the relay takes the resistance out of the system.  
Other side ùëá>ùëáùë†, which gives  ‚àí2 millivolt signal. So, the resistance is high. So, the relay  will 
come down and include this resistance in the circuit. So, now you have two resistance in the 
circuit. So, resistance is high and your coil resistance here remains same, but it receives 
different amount of voltage. So, different amount of voltage and different amount of current.  
So, the relay comes down and the current comes down and you get ùëá>ùëáùë† which means  that 
the heating coil will not heat as much ; it will be a cooler coil, cooler system. So, that is how 
this system works and these are some of the examples which are very  fundamental. But all over 
the process industry, the variations of these things are used  regularly to make sure that the 
process wo rks to the desired objective.  (Refer Slide Time: 31:08)  
 
We will close this section with operational amplifiers. See, electronic gadgets now are abound 
everywhere. So, operational amplifiers we have summing amplifier say at three  voltage s V1, 
V2, and V3, going through resistance R1, R2 , and  R3. This is a transistor operational amplifier 
or a transistor . The operational amplifier is positive terminal and negative terminal here.  
So, the three voltages are basically added : 
ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°=‚àíùëÖùëì[ùëâ1
ùëÖ1+ùëâ2
ùëÖ2+ùëâ3
ùëÖ3] 
ùëÖùëì is the feedback resistance.  
If      ùëÖùëì=ùëÖ1+ùëÖ2+ùëÖ3 
Then      ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°=‚àíùëÖùëì[ùëâ1+ùëâ2+ùëâ3] 
So, this is an adder summing amplifier . We are doing basic mathematical operation ; 
electronically it is possible.  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:14)  
 
Then you have differential amplifiers . V2 and V1  are the two voltage . This is the common 
ground. So, this is going to the positive terminal, this is going to the negative terminal. So , 
ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°=(ùëÖùëì
ùëÖùëñùëõ)[ùëâ2‚àíùëâ1] 
If       ùëÖùêπ=ùëÖùëñùëõ 
Then       ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°=ùëâ2‚àíùëâ1 
So, that is differentiator a differential amplifier.  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:45)  
 
Then we go to differentiator amplifier . We have ùëâùëñùëõ and ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°. So, there is a capacitance here , 
and feedback resistance  is ùëÖùëì. 
ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°=‚àíùëÖùëìùê∂[ùëëùëâùëñùëõ
ùëëùë°] 
ùëëùëâùëñùëõ
ùëëùë°=the slope of the voltage curve . 
The voltage changing with time gives the slope of the voltage curve.  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:16)  
 
Then we go to integrating amplifier, here we have ùëâùëñùëõ, ùëÖùëñùëõ, capacitance , and  ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°. 
ùëâùëúùë¢ùë°=‚àí1
ùëÖùëñùëõùê∂‚à´ùëâùëñùëõùëëùë°ùë°
0 
 ‚à´ùëâùëñùëõùëëùë°ùë°
0 means the area under the curve . 
Typical ly, ùëâùëñùëõ is going like a sawtooth wave box type of arrangement  from ‚àí1 volt to 0 volt, 
then ùëâùëúùë¢ùë° will be starting from 0 voltage will go to high value , then come back to 0, high value 
come back to 0 and high value come back to 0 ; because this is going integration of the ùëâùëñùëõùëëùë° 
over time ; it is integrating the voltage. So, from 0 it is coming ther e, going to be high value, so 
‚àí1 to 0. So, that is starting from 0 going to 1 and then it is coming back to 0 that again 1.50. 
So, this is the integrator.
