Laplace Transform Review - 1 
This is lecture two of module one; in module 1, we are discussing the fundamentals of process 
control. And lectu re two covers Laplace transform review. Now, those of you who have taken 
transform calculus should not feel at all bothered by this topic, but t hose who have not taken 
transform calculus should be paying some more attention than others and should refer to a 
textbook or reference book to brush up on the Laplace transform part of the calculus.  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:04)  
 
So, now, we are covering con cepts starting from the ordinary differential equation, then decay 
function, ramp function, step function, delayed function, and unit pulse function, which is a list 
of Laplace transform for common functions that are encountered in signal processing or 
control.  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:30)  
 
So, we start with the ordinary differential equation that is dy/dx. This is  
𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑥+𝑃𝑦=𝑄 
Here, P and Q are constants . The ordinary differential equation, which is not having a constant 
coefficient , cannot be solved by the Laplace transform. So, the Laplace transform is strictly 
applicable to the ordinary differential equation or ODE with constant coefficients . That is 
impo rtant; you should remember that.  If P and Q are functions of x and y , then the Laplace 
transform will not work. So, here is the integrating factor 𝐼=𝑒∫𝑃𝑑𝑥. Or, in other words , 𝑒𝑃𝑥. 
Now, if we multiply all terms by 𝑒𝑃𝑥, we get this equation 𝑒𝑃𝑥 here, 𝑒𝑃𝑥 here, 𝑒𝑃𝑥 here. Once 
we do that, then this left -hand side becomes much easier to handle , which is 𝑑
𝑑𝑥(𝑦𝑒𝑃𝑥). And 
the right -hand side is 𝑄𝑒𝑃𝑥. So, now, we integrate . 
∫𝑑(𝑦𝑒𝑃𝑥)=𝑄∫𝑒𝑃𝑥𝑑𝑥 
So, if I am integrating this , only this term will remain ; so, 
𝑦𝑒𝑃𝑥=𝑄
𝑃𝑒𝑃𝑥+𝐶 
C is the constant of integration. So,  
𝑦=𝑄
𝑃+𝐶𝑒−𝑃𝑥 
(Refer Slide Time: 3:12)  
 
So, using Laplace transform , we do the same thing to get the solution ; 𝑦=𝑄
𝑃(1−𝑒−𝑃𝑥) we 
got from the ordinary differential equation solution. Now, we put the Laplace transform to use, 
𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑥+𝑃𝑦=𝑄. So, the Laplace transform  of a derivative comes as 𝑠𝑓(𝑠). So, 𝑠𝑓(𝑠) is the 
Laplace transform of the function  𝑓(𝑡). 𝑓(𝑡) is the general function . So, when I take Laplace , 
I write it as 𝑓̅(𝑠), that is , the Laplace transform.  
So, here 𝑠𝑓(𝑠), the bar has not come . If you put the bar there , so 𝑠𝑓(𝑠) Laplace transform times 
𝑠 𝑃 times Laplace transform, Laplace transform . My function is 𝑦. So, 𝑦 is a function of 𝑥. Say 
𝑦=𝑎𝑥 and Laplace transform of 𝑦 will be a Laplace transform of 𝑥. So, that is the Laplace 
transform of the function. The r ight side is 𝑄. If it is a number , say,  5, 10, 15 , you have to take 
Laplace transform that will be 5/𝑠, 10/𝑠, 15/𝑠 depending on what the value of 𝑄 is. These 
things you will learn from the ready reckoner or the table that I will give you.  
(𝑠+𝑃)𝑓(𝑠)=𝑄
𝑠 
So, 𝑓(𝑠)=𝑄
𝑠(𝑠+𝑃) 
This is known as partial fractio n. So, that is 𝐴
𝑠−𝐵
𝑠+𝑃. See , whenever you have the denominator 
𝑠 coming in as two  separate expression s, they can be separated by using a partial fraction. So, 
this is the partial fractions 𝐴
𝑠−𝐵
𝑠+𝑃.  
So, now, how would we find out A and B? What we do is we multiply 𝐴 by (𝑠+𝑃) and 𝐵 by 
𝑠; 𝐴𝑠+𝐴𝑃−𝐵𝑠 in the numerator and that we know is equal to 𝑄. So, 𝑄 is outside ; so 
(𝐴−𝐵)𝑠+𝐴𝑃. So, if I take 𝑠1, it has a coefficient (𝐴−𝐵), and in this thing , I know that the 
coefficient of 𝑠 is 0. So, that mean s 𝐴=𝐵, that I get from here. And the last step 𝐴𝑃 is here 
that is equal to 𝑄; 𝑄 is outside. So, 𝐴𝑃=1.  
So, if 𝐴=𝐵 and 𝐴−𝐵=0, 𝐴𝑃 is 1, so 𝑨=𝟏𝑷⁄, and B also becomes 𝟏𝑷⁄. So, 
(𝑨−𝑩)𝒔+𝑨𝑷
𝒔(𝒔+𝑷)=𝑸
𝑷[𝟏
𝒔−𝟏
𝒔+𝑷] 
So, 𝒚=𝑸
𝑷(𝟏−𝒆−𝑷𝒙) 
This e take s inverse Laplace transform. This  thing comes from the inverse Laplace transform. 
So, we will explain these things in tables. For now, you take my word for granted that if you 
take the inverse Laplace transform  of  𝟏𝒔⁄, it becomes 1 , and you take inverse Laplace 
transform  of 𝟏
𝒔+𝑷 it becom es 𝒆−𝑷𝒙.  
So, 𝒚=𝑸
𝑷(𝟏−𝒆−𝑷𝒙), and that is the same thing that we got by solving the ordinary differential 
equation by the classical method. So, Laplace transform gives you the same solution, but the 
trouble is much simpler depending on the nature of the differential equation. If the differential 
equation is complicated , Laplace transform will really help you reach the solution much 
quicker.  
(Refer Slide Time: 7:46)   
So, let us go to the definition ; Laplace transform is a solution technique by which linear 
ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients can be solved. L, Laplace transform 
is which say 𝑳[𝒇(𝒕)]=𝒇̅(𝒔)=∫𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒇(𝒕)𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎. Defi nition of Laplace transform is that. A 
function is 𝒇(𝒕); you multiply it by 𝒆−𝒔𝒕 and then integrate over the element 𝑑𝑡 from 0 to 
infinity. 𝑠 is a complex variable ; this is 𝒂+𝒋𝒃, 𝑠 is a complex variable having real and 
imaginary parts, 𝑎 is the real part, 𝑏 is the imaginary part.  
So, if I take  a decaying function , 𝒇(𝒕)=𝒆−𝒂𝒕. Then Laplace transform 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 is ∫𝒆−(𝒔+𝒂)𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎, 
because 𝒆−𝒔𝒕 is in the definition of  Laplace transform. So, when I multiply 𝒆−𝒂𝒕 and 𝒆−𝒔𝒕, it 
become s 𝒆−(𝒔+𝒂)𝒕. −𝟏
𝒔+𝒂. Then I integrate ; the integration of this comes from 𝒆−𝒂𝒙𝒅𝒙 if you 
integrate that is  1
𝑎𝒆−𝒂𝒙. So, here 𝒆−(𝒔+𝒂)𝒕is integrat ed. So, 𝒔+𝒂 comes in the denominator with 
a minus sign , and that is 0 to infinity. So, infinity , if I take 𝑡=∞, then the first term is 1
𝑒∞, so 
that is 0. The second term , when t is 0, this term is 0. So, th is term 0 means this quantity 
becomes 1. So, I am left with −𝟏
𝒔+𝒂. This becomes minus , the other minus is coming because 
you are taking in the second term, fir st term and the second term, the second term will be minus. 
So, this minus and the second term minus will cancel out ; it will be 𝟏
𝒔+𝒂. So, Laplace 𝒆𝒂𝒕=𝟏
𝒔−𝒂. 
Minus 𝒂𝒕 is 𝟏
𝒔+𝒂, plus  𝒂𝒕 is  𝟏
𝒔−𝒂. So, this is a formula to remember. It is a very handy formula 
you should remember it. That e to the power exponential function always appears as 𝑠 plus or 
minus 𝑎 in the denominator. This is a function . The nature of the function is a decaying 
function, it is coming from some finite value and reaching 0.  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:40)  
 
So, let us move . Ramp function 𝒇(𝒕)=𝒂𝒕. We are taking the Laplace transform of the function 
𝒂𝒕; this is called the ramp function. Ramp because you know it goes from 0 to some value w ith 
a slope, the slope is 𝑎, so that is like a ramp, so that is why it is called Ramp function. Laplace 
transf orm of  𝑎𝑡 is ∫𝒂𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎. That is our definition of Laplace transform you should 
multiply the function by 𝒆−𝒔𝒕, and then integrate over the element 𝑑𝑡 from limit 0 to infinity. 
So, that is how we get the first one here.  
Now, 𝑎 we can take out ; it is a constant , so it does not have to be integrated . That gives us the 
second expression 𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕. Now, here, we apply integration by parts . Now, that is , this thing 
is 𝒖=𝒕, I have 𝑡 here; I call it 𝑢 and the rest of 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕 I call 𝑑𝑣. So, the integration by parts 
means that if you have 𝑢𝑣, the product of two variable s, they can be separated as 𝑢𝑑𝑣 +𝑣𝑑𝑢. 
So, this expression here I call ∫𝑢𝑑𝑣. So, ∫𝑢𝑑𝑣 =−𝑢𝑣−𝑣𝑑𝑢. So, 𝑢𝑣 declared  as 𝑡 and 𝑣 as 
this 𝑑𝑣 is this 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕. So, 𝒗=−𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔. So, 𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕 is your 𝑢𝑣 from 0 to infinity and 𝑣𝑑𝑢 is v is 
this term 𝑄 is 𝑡, so, t his term 𝑑𝑡.  
So, now, the integration has become very simple ; I was having trouble figuring out how to 
separate this. Once I separate this , it becomes very easy. So, first term 𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔 with a negative 
sign, if you take the first uppe r limit, infinity, then 𝒆−∞ becomes 0. So, the first term is 0 , and 
if I take 𝑡=0, the second term is also 0. So, this term drops out because the here is a 𝑡. So, t 
will be 0. So, that drops out.  
Then the second term h ere is 𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔𝒅𝒕 0 to infinity. I integrate second time; first-time integration 
was here 𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕 that gave me 𝒕𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔 with a negative sign. Now, 𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔𝟐 after a second in tegration 
goes from 0 to infinity.  
So, if I put the value 0 to infinity, the first infinity , if I take 𝒆−∞ that is going to be 0 and the 
second term becomes if I put 0, 𝟏
𝒔𝟐. So, this whole thing works out as 𝒂
𝒔𝟐 that is the Laplace 
transform of the ramp function , which is 𝑎𝑡. Now, you see the sequence, if I take Laplace 
transform of 1, it becomes, I will come to that see the sequence here to follow.  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:02)  
 
So, this is a step function ; the function comes like this , then goes up and then goes like this. 
Now, can you think of some physical process where this function is commonly encountered ? 
That is the lighting of a switch . When it comes to a room , and we turn the fan or  turn the light 
on, what we are doing is sending the voltage from 0 to 250 volts ; here in India it is 250. In 
other place s, it is 110 volt also is there.  
So, 0 to 250 for just a very short time which is we can ignore that duration because it is probably 
millise cond, microsecond, nanosecond , something like that. So, we say that instantaneously it 
goes from 𝑎𝑡=0 it goes instantaneously from 0 value to 250 volt. So, that is a switch, lighting 
of a switch, lighting a fan is a step function.  
So, here the  function is given as : 0 at 𝒕<𝟎 and the value is 𝐴 at 𝒕≥𝟎. So, 𝑳[𝒇(𝒕)]=𝑳[𝑨]. 
So, ∫𝑨𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕∞
𝟎. So, it is −𝑨𝒆−𝒔𝒕
𝒔|
𝟎∞
. So, i t is 𝑨
𝒔.  
So, now, you see the sequence if I have a constant Laplace transform that is 𝑨
𝒔. This is what I 
was telling you in the ordinary differential equation solution that Q  I was having on the right -
hand side , and 𝑄/𝑠 is the Laplace transfor m of that set. Any constant figure, if you take Laplace 
transform, it is just that constant figure divided by 𝑠.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:47)  
 
So, now, delayed function, the delayed function is 𝒇(𝒕−𝒕𝟎), 𝑳[𝒇(𝒕−𝒕𝟎)]=∫𝒇(𝒕−∞
𝟎
𝒕𝟎)𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝒅𝒕. That is the definition. So, here is what we do . We multiplied by 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎. So, if I 
multiply by 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎 I have to multiply it by 𝒆𝒔𝒕𝟎 to keep it the same. So, that plus 𝒔𝒕𝟎 come s here 
minus 𝒔𝒕𝟎.  
So, this I can convert from 𝑑𝑡 to 𝒅(𝒕−𝒕𝟎); that is my domain, variable domain. So, 𝒇(𝒕−
𝒕𝟎)𝒆−𝒔(𝒕−𝒕𝟎)𝒅(𝒕−𝒕𝟎) that if I shorten, I can substitute 𝝉 for it. So, i t becomes 𝒇(𝝉)𝒆−𝒔𝝉𝒅𝝉 and 
𝝉 goes from −𝒕𝟎 to infinity . So, that can be minus t, the function does not exist at −𝒕𝟎.  
So, 0 to infinity , I can substitute for −𝒕𝟎 to infinity. So, 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎∫𝒇(𝝉)𝒆−𝒔𝝉𝒅𝝉∞
𝟎. So, 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎𝒇̅(𝒔). 
So, that is the Laplace transform of a delayed function. So, what is the difference? If 𝒇̅(𝒔) is 
the Laplace transform of function 𝑓(𝑡), then I multiply  by 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎 and that becomes the Laplace 
transform of the delayed function.  
Now, if it is an advanced function , this one is an advanced function here. 𝒕 = −𝒕𝟎, the function 
has gone back and started there. So, this is advanced, this is de layed. So, the delayed function 
this will be 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎, advanced function is it is going forward then it is the delayed function this t 
is equal to 𝑡0 it is starting. So, that is your −𝒔𝒕𝟎 and this is t minus  𝒕𝟎 it is starting , which  means 
it is advanced then it will be +𝒔𝒕𝟎.

Unit pulse function is a box type of arrangement. 𝐴 is the width , and 𝟏𝑨⁄ is the height. So, 
𝐴×𝟏𝑨⁄ is 1, unit area . That is what is called unit , and pulse , it is like a pulse. I was telling you 
about the lighting on the switch, lighting the switch at nine o’clock in the morning when he 
come s to the class. So, here you assume that at nine o’clock I turn the switch on and then at 
nine five I turn it off bec ause I may want the dark room to present my slides or something like 
that. So, this width is nine to nine five, nine o’clock five minutes. This is the weight , and it was 
250 volts here. So, that is the height. So, this whole thing , I am taking it as uni ty. That is my 
unit, 250 volt s into five minutes , that will be the unit.  
So, here you see 𝒇(𝒕)=𝟏𝑨⁄ when 𝟎≤𝒕≤𝑨 and 𝒇(𝒕)=𝟎 when 𝒕>𝑨. So, 𝟏𝑨⁄ is the height 
ordinate o f the function height. And that value exists between 0 and A. Below 0 and above A , 
this is 0. So, here what we do is we can take 𝒇(𝒕) comprised of two parts 𝒇𝟏(𝒕) and 𝒇𝟐(𝒕) 
where  
𝒇𝟏(𝒕)={𝟎          𝒕<𝟎
𝟏𝑨⁄     𝒕≥𝟎 
That is your this portion . And 
𝒇𝟐(𝒕)={𝟎          𝒕<𝑨
𝟏𝑨⁄     𝒕≥𝑨 
So, 𝒇𝟐(𝒕) and 𝒇𝟏(𝒕) are related. You see this is 0 to 𝟏𝑨⁄, these are the limits ; he has 0 to 𝟏𝑨⁄, 
A is the limit. So, I call it 𝒇𝟏(𝒕−𝑨). So, 𝜹(𝒕)=𝒇𝟏(𝒕)−𝒇𝟐(𝒕)    =𝒇𝟏(𝒕)−𝒇𝟏(𝒕−𝑨). Same 
function it is going like this coming up , and here it is inverting going like this. So, 𝒇𝟏(𝒕)−
𝒇𝟏(𝒕−𝑨) that is 𝒇𝟏(𝒕) is this function, then the reverse function is 𝒇𝟏(𝒕−𝑨) with a minus 
sign.  
So, the 𝜹(𝒕), unit pulse function can be written as 𝒇𝟏(𝒕)−𝒇𝟏(𝒕−𝑨). So, 𝑳[𝜹(𝒕)]=
𝑳[𝒇𝟏(𝒕)]−𝑳[𝒇𝟏(𝒕−𝑨)]. And we just learned that dela yed function will have 𝒆−𝒔𝒕𝟎 as a factor. 
So, 𝒇𝟏̅̅̅(𝒔)−𝒇𝟏̅̅̅(𝒔)𝒆−𝒔𝑨; −𝒔𝑨 because it is A here, so it is 𝒆−𝒔𝑨 coming.  
So, this works out as  (𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨)𝒇𝟏̅̅̅(𝒔) and the 𝑠𝐴 come s here . 𝑓1 is the step function  of step  𝑠, 
let this go to this 1. This is 𝐴/𝑠. So, if it is 1/𝐴 then it will be 𝑠𝐴. 𝑠𝐴 here that thing comes in 
the denominator. 𝟏−𝒆−𝒔𝑨 and 𝑓1 works out as 𝑠𝐴. There 𝐴 was the height, h ere A is 1/𝐴, so 
that is why A is in the denominator.  (Refer Slide Time: 21:37)

The Laplace transform is a handy tool for the solution of  ordinary differential equations with 
constant coefficients. Real -time variables are transformed into the complex plane to obtain 
algebraic relationships. There is a conclusion. Thank you.
