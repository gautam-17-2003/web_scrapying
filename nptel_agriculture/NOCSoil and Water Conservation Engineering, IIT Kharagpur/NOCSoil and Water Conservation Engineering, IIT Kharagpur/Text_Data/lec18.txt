Problems on Bench Terraces  
 
Hello friends , welcome back to NPTEL  online certificati on course  on Soil and Water 
Conservation E ngineering . I am Professor  Rajendra S ingh from the Agriculture and F ood 
Engineering Department of IIT  Kharagpur . We are in week 4, lecture  18, and today we 
will see Problems on Bench T erraces . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:40 ) 
 
Just to give you an idea about the course content of this week . We started lecture 16 by 
introducing terraces . In lecture 17,  we saw some of the concepts or relationships on how 
to derive for bench terraces . Then today’s lecture , we will solve problems deali ng wi th 
the design of bench terraces . In lecture 19, we will see  broad -based terraces . And lecture 
20, we will solve problems on broad -base terraces .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 01:10 ) 
 
Now, starting with problem number 1 , in a hilly region , bench terracing is pro posed for 
cultivation purpose s. The general land slope is 30 per cent. Every soil depth is about 1 
meter , limiting the depth of the cut to 2.7 meters . The r iser is to be laid on 1 is to 1 
gradient . And compute the following that is the width of the terrace , and earthwork per 
hectare , and its cost at  Indian rupees 2.5 per cubic meter . So, this is what it is . So, the 
land slope is given , the depth of cut is given , riser slope is given , we have to find the 
width of a terrace , and then we have to find out the earthwork  and its cost, the unit cost is 
given . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:02 ) 
  
 So, that means  the data that are given are land slope S equals 30 per cent. Soil depth is 1 
meter . The d epth of cut , which is D/2, is 0.7. And the riser slope is 1:1. And in the 
previous class , we derived t he relationship between the width of the bench terrace and 
the depth of cut , and that is the relationship we have to use here . But, as I earlier also the 
case of bund  also I said, you typically need not remember the formula e, you c an go and 
derive the formula from the  fundamental principles , probably you understand the 
concept . 
So, let us try here , this is  for this one, this is the land slope , which is given here , what  is 
going on  I try again. So, this is the bench terrace  we are tr ying to do . And in this case , it 
is said that it is a  one is to 1 riser, so that means, here and  that means, the width will be 
further on the other side . So, this is we are  from here ; the width is starting, this is  D by 
two that is a depth of curve . So, this is also D by two because the rise r slope i s 1:1, and 
then we have W/2 here. So, for this triangle ABC here, and then a land slope we have is 
S/100. 
So, this is S, this is 100, so that means  we have two equilateral  triangles , where we can  
write that  
D/2)/(W/2 + D/2) = S/100  
D = WS/(100 -S) 
So, you can simply de rive this relationship and in a couple of minutes very quickly . So, 
we can write  
W = D(100 -S)/S 
Given that is D/2 is 0.7. So, D is available , a value of S is known to us . So, by putting the 
value of  D and S in this equation , we can f ind out the value of W   
W = 1.4(100-30)/30 = 3.27 m   
 (Refer Slide Time: 05:27 ) 
 
Similarly, earthwork we  derive  the relationship for earthwork , so we have to calculate 
the earthwork . And earthwork per hectare for a vertica l riser, Ew = 1250  D. And again , 
we derived very simply  because we said that this is a vertical ris er. So, basically , we 
have to find out the area of this , and this is D/2, this is W/2, so that means  the area of this 
triangle is ½ × W/2 × D/2 = WD/8 . And this has to be multiplied by  length , which at the 
length of the terrace per hectare  so, WD/100 times 10000 /W.  
Volum e, Ew = (DW/8 ) × (10000/W ) = 1250D   m3/ha 
And in the case of 1:1 slope ris er, D equals to this . So, we have  to replace this equation . 
So, the earthwork per hectare for riser  slope of 1:1 we have  the relationship ; we have to 
use 1250 D.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:5 4) 
 
And, if we d o that putting the values here , W value we k now, S value we know . So, 
putting here , earthwork comes out to be  
Ew = 1250 WS/(100-S) = 1250 (3.27×30)/70 = 1752 m3 
Obviously , this is everything per hectare  becaus e we used per hectare length 10000 /W in 
our deriving the relationship . So, the cost of earthwork  per hectare  is because the  per-unit 
cost is given as 2.5 rupees , so it comes out to be Indian rupees = 2.5 ×1752 = 4380 . So, 
the answers are the width of the terrace is 3.27 meters , earthwork  per hectare is 1752  
cubic meters , and the cost of earth work per hectare is Indian rupees 4380. So, very 
simply , we can solve this probl em.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 07:42 ) 
 
Let us go to the next problem , which is a design problem . Design a bench terrace  for an 
area, which has sandy  loam soil and a land slope of 15 per cent. Terrace  width  acts as a 
channel , which is provi ded with a uniform grade  of 0.4 per cent, so we say  uniform  
graded  terrace  basically . Other details are maximum rainfall intensity of the area during 
10-years , the return period is 25 centimet res per hour , for the duration equal to the time 
of concent ration . And the total length of the bench terrace is 150 meters that are the 
longitudinal length is given . Assume  other information a s per standards . So, these are the 
data given . 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:27 ) 
  
 So if we  sum the data , so the soil is sandy loam . Land  slope , S is 15 per cent. Terrace  
channel grade is 0.4 per cent. 10-year maximum rainfall intensity for a duration equal to 
the time of concentration is 25 centimet res per hour . And the length of the terrace  is 150 
meters . So, for the given rainfall condition , we let  us say that  we choose a n inward -
sloping bench terrace with a slope of 5 per cent. So, it is a high rainfall area , we are 
assuming , and we are  designing an inward -sloping bench terrace  with a slope of 5 per 
cent. And we are also making certain assumptions  that are the terrace width is 600 
meters for the given land slope 15 per cent, and we are assuming a ba tter slope of 1:1 
that is 1:1 riser is 1:1 slope . So, these are the assumptions  we are making . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:23 ) 
 
So, let us go ahead . So, the area o f the terrace is 
A = (L×W)/10000  = (150×6)/10000 = 0.09 ha.  
And this is the area , which will act as a catchment area . So, whatever rainfall occurs in  
that has to be drained out . And the peak discharge t o be handled , we typically use the 
Rational  formula . 
We have seen that many times , in the formula , where  I is the rainfall intensity in 
centimet re per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration , which is the case 
given here ; in this case,  the problem  clearly states that  rainfall inte nsity is 25 centimet re  
 per hour. The a rea we have obtained is 0.09 hectares . And the C  value runoff  coefficient  
we are assuming is 0.3 because not given , 
Q = CI A/36  = (0.3×25×0.09) /36 = 0.01875 m3/s 
Please rememb er that cubic meter per second  is also written as cumec . So, some times 
some of the textbooks , you might come across the term cumec , whic h simply refers to 
cubic meter per second ; you must remember this . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:45 ) 
 
So, now we have to design  the cross -section . So, let us say that  the depth of the channel 
let us assume as 0.3 meters . So, here we are assuming that this depth is 30 centimet res or 
0.3 meters . And this is the batter slopes  1:1, so obviously, this will also be  0.3 meters . 
And the terrace width is 6 meters , but we are also assuming that shoulder  bund  this width 
of shoulder bund is 0.75 meters , so that is why effectively the width of the terrace which 
is of level is 5.25 meters or that the area  where  the flow will take place is  5.25 meters . 
So, the area of the flow available in the area of the tria ngle ABC , which is the sum of 
two triangles , ADB  and BDC , are two triangle s.  
Total area of ABC = area of ADB + area of BDC  
         = ½ × 0.3 × 0.3 + ½ × 0.3 × 5.25 
         = 0.045 + 0.79 = 0.84 m2  
 (Refer Slide Time: 12:12 ) 
 
So, now wetted  perim eter als o we have to find out . So, wetted  perimeter , we already 
know that it is this length AB and BC. So, we can always find : what is the value of AB 
and what is the value of BC very easily . So, the wetted perimeter ; 
P = AB +  BC 
= √(0.302+0.302) + √(5.252+0.302) = 0.424 + 5.259 = 5.68 m 
The hydraulic radius , which is the ratio of area and wetted perimeter . The a rea we have 
calculated , wetted perimeter we have calculated . So, the value of R comes out to be  
R = A /P = 0.84/5.68 = 0.14 8 m or 0.15 m  
So, now we have to use M anning’s equation for calculating the velocity of flow . The 
value M anning’s n, we are assuming at 0.04. 
V = 1/ n R2/3 S1/2 = 1/0.04 (0.15)2/3 (0.004)1/2 = 0.45 m/s  
And the velocity comes out to be  0.45 meter s per second , which is a non -erosive  velocity  
because we know that eve n for sandy soil , the value i s 0.5, and otherwise , it is 0.69; 
these are the recommendations . So, it is a non -erosive velocity , we calculated .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:43 ) 
 
So, now, using the C ontinui ty equation ,  
Q = A ×V = 0.84×0.45 = 0. 378 m3/s 
The calculated discharge capacity is  0.378  cubic meter s per second , where the required 
capacity is 0.01875  cubic meter s per second . 
So, the calculated discharge capacity of a channel is much larger than the re quired 
capacity . So, as far as design is concerned , there i s no problem ; as far as safe disposal of 
runoff is concerne d, there is no problem , but the only case is  that is  it is a case of over 
design . So, here we have two options , we may either accept the d esign or go for another 
iteration by assuming a lower depth of  the channel , so that also is possible that we start  
with 30 centimet res or 0.3 meters , we can also go lower the channel  width  anything is 
possible .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 14:47 ) 
 
Now we go to the next problem that is problem number 3; that is design ing a 150-meter 
long inward -sloping bench terrace for an area  having an average  land slope of 20 per 
cent. The soil is clay loam . The terrace  channel has a uniform grid of 0.5 per cent. The 
maximum inten sity of one-hour rainfall for the location is 10 centimet res per hour . So,  
the type of terrace is already given , its length is given , the land slope is given , the grade 
is a grade of the channel is given , and intensity maximum intensity rainfall is given . So, 
these are the data , which are already available to us. 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:37 ) 
  
 Now, that means  the data gi ven are a type of terrace is  the inward -sloping  terrace . The 
length of the terrace , l, is 150 meters . Land slope , S is 20 per cent. Soil is cl ay loa m. And 
terrace  channel slope is 0.5 per cent. And maximum one-hour rainfall intensity is 10 
centimet res per hour . For the terrace , we may assume that the inner end is 0.2 meters  
lower than the other end , so that means  we are  instead of  the slope ; we are saying that 
elevation difference . The w idth we are assuming is 4.5 meters , which is generally 
recommende d that 15 to 25 per cent, it could be 4.5 meters 25 to 30 per cent is 3 meters , 
these are general recomm endations , we can use them . And the batter s lope is 1:1. So, 
these are the assumptions . We are making three assumptions . 
(Refer Slide Time: 16:32 ) 
 
Now, we use the Rational formula  all the time to determine the peak runoff rate , which 
we have to do here also that is Q = CIA/36. So, the first thing is that we have to find out 
what is the area of the terrace , which is the width , times lengt h; its width is 4.5 meters , 
length is given as 150 meters , so it comes out to be 675 square meters or 0.675  hectares  
because 1 hectare is 10,000 square meter . So, using that , we can calculate the area .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:08 ) 
 
Now, in this case , we have  to determine the time of concentration  because you remember  
CIA, I is intensity for a duration equal to the time of concentration , we have given we 
have been give n in the problem one-hour rainfall . So, we have to find out the time of 
concentration . And for that , we typically use the kirpi ch formula , which is  
Tc = 0.0195 L0.77 S-0.385 
So, the length of flow is typically the l onger  the len gth, the longitudinal lengt h, and the 
width of the terrace , so that if the terrace  is a like  this here something like this , so 
obviously, the flow has to travers e this distance , and the longitudinal distance .  
L = I+W  = 150+4 .5 = 154.5 m 
Total fall over the flow length , there are two fall s, one is in this direction , and one is the 
longitudinal direction . So, this fall  is already given as 0.2 meters ; we are assuming that , 
and thi s is channel is graded grade  slope  is given as 0.5 per cent.  
H = fal l over terrace width + fall  over chann el length  
= 0.2 + 150 × (0.5/100) = 0.275 m  
So, the total  fall comes out to be 0.275  meters .  
So, the slop e is the total elevation difference over total length ,   
 S = H/L  = 0.275/154.5  = 0.00178 , and that i s the value we have to use for S in case of 
Kirpi ch formula . So, now  we know L, we know S. So, by putting in this formula , we get  
Tc = 0.0195 154.50.77 0.00178-0.385 = 10.8 min  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:17 ) 
 
Now, we have been given a 1-hour intensity of rainfall , which is 10 centimet res per hour , 
but our time of concentration is only 10.5 minutes . So, we have to find the intensity 
corresponding to that . For th at, we can use a standard nomo graph , which relates one-
hour rainfall intensity in centimet re per hour to rainfall intensity for any duration  
centimet re per hour . And for different d urations , these curves are available that is 5-
minute duration , 15-minute d eviation , 30 minutes , 60 minute s and so on, and the rest of 
the values , we have to  typically interpolate . 
So, now, first, we get our difference ; 1-hour intensity is 10 centimet res per hour , which  
means  our value will lie on this line . So, this is one thing , and we have to talk about  we 
have to search for 10.8 minutes , this is 5 minutes . So, here this line , this is 5 minutes , and 
this is 15 minutes . So, somewh ere here , our value will lie . And typically , if we take half 
is that will be 10 minutes somewhere here , and this is 22.5, so that is why we may say 
that it will be around 22 centimet res per hour .   
 So, that is why from the  nomo graph , we get that the rai nfall intensity for 10.8 minutes , 
that is , our time of concentration  comes out to be 22 centimet res per hour . And then , we 
assume a value of  the runoff coefficient is 0.6. So,  
Q = CI A/36  = (0.6×22×0.0675 )/36 = 0.02 5 m3/s 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:25 ) 
 
Now, we have to check for flow velocity of flow and carrying capacity of the channel 
formed by construction . So, let us say that this is ou r typical  drying for this particular 
one. So, this is the inward -sloping bench terrace ; the elevation difference is 20 
centimetres or 0.2 meter s, just shown here . The total  width we assumed was 4.5, but we 
are also assuming tha t the shoulder  bund  has a base width of 75 centimet res, so that 
means  the flow  width of the terrace , which is available for flow , is 3.75 meters . And th is 
is a typical dimension of the  shoulder bu nd, which is being used here . And this riser is 
1:1 that we have assumed . 
So, basically , the total area of flow is this one . This is the total area of flow , which is  a 
sum of the areas of two triangles , ABC  and BCD, and because this is 0.2 meters , this is 
1:1, so this is 0.2 meters , and this is 3.75 already given . So, we can easily calculate the 
area of these two triangles or the total area that is the total flow area . Basically , we can 
call it a flow area , the total flow area is available with us .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 22:54 ) 
 
So, calculating the area of ABC ,  a1 = ½ × 0.20 × 0.20 = 0.02 m2 
Area of BCD , a2 = ½ × 0.20 × 3.75 = 0.375  m2 
A = a1 + a2 = 0.02 +0.375 = 0.395 m2 
Similarly , we require a wetted perimeter , whic h is AB plus BD, because all dimensions 
are known , so we can easily calculate the length , and it comes out to be  
P = AB +  BD = √(0.202+0.202) + √(3.752+0.202) = 0.283 + 5.25 4 = 5.54 m 
So, the wetted perimeter comes out to be 5.54 meters . So, hydraulic rad ius R is the ratio 
of A and P that is cross -sectional area and wetted perimeter . Cross-sectional area , we 
have calculated , but at the perimeter , we have calculated . So, the value of R  comes out to 
be  
R = A/P  = 0.395/5.54 = 0.0713 or 0.071 m  
So, this is th e hydraulic radius  for the  design ing section .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 23:54 ) 
 
So, using M anning’s formula , we can calculate the velocity of flow . And the velocity of 
flow is : (the value of n, we are assuming at 0.04) 
V = 1/ n R2/3 S1/2 = 1/0.04 (0. 071)2/3 (0.00 5)1/2 = 0.30 m/s 
So, using thi s, we get the velocity of flow is 0.3 meter s per second , which is non -erosive , 
that is, because it is less than 0.69 for normal soils , so that is why  it is a non -erosive  
velocity that is the recommended non-non-erosive  velocit y limit . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:38 ) 
  
 So, here, using C ontinuity  equation ; 
Q = A ×V = 0.395 ×0.30 = 0.12 m3/s 
So, the carrying capacity  comes out to be 0.12 cubic meter s per second , which is the 
calculated discharge , and which is larger than the required cap acity, which is 0.025  cubic 
meters . 
This is the value  we got , which  is 0.025  cubic meter s per second , so that means  that is 
the flow we wanted to dispose  of. The channel section  we have designed is the capacity 
to take the carrier discharge of 0.12 cubic me ters per second . So,  since it is larger than 
this, so there is absolutely no problem . So, we may go ahead and accept the design , so 
that is how the channel cross -section can be or the terrace design can be completed . 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:54 ) 
. 
So, now we  go to the  next problem , which says that on a 20 per cent hill slope , it is 
proposed to construct bench  terraces . If the vertical interval of the terrace  is 2 meters , 
calculate the following ; length of terrace  per hectare , earthwork required per he ctare , and 
area lost per hectare both for a vertical cut , and ba tter slope of 1 is to 1. The cut should 
be equal to fill the best -balanced cross -section. That is what we always  do. 
So, 20 per cent hill slope is given , bench  terrace  we have to construct , the vertic al 
interval is given as 2 meters , we have to calculate the length of the terrace , we have to 
calculate the earth work  required per hectare , we have to calculate the area loss per  
 hectare  for two cases  when the riser is vertical , and the when the bet ter is 1:1. And of 
course,  this is the guideline that cut should be equal to fill. T his is what is the problem . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:54 ) 
 
So, that simply means that for this problem , we have given land s lope, S equal s 20 per 
cent, and the vertica l interval that equals 2 meter s; two important  conditions are already 
given . So, let us say take a case of case 1, where is the riser is vertical . So, the width of  
the bench  terrace , we calculated in this case ,  
W = 100D/S  = (100×2)/20 = 10 m  
And the length of terrace per  hectare  means  the to per hectare  area divided by the width 
that will give us the tota l length of terrace  per hectare  = 10000/10 = 1000 m per hectare 
area. 
And the earthwork  per hectare , we design  we calculate this relationship 1250 times D. 
So, there is a  very straightforward relationship , and because  the value of D is known to 
us. So, by putting the value of D equals 2, the total earthwork comes out to be 2500  cubic 
meters , so that means, if the riser is vertical , the width is 10 meters ; the length of terrace 
per hectare is  1000  meters , and the earthwork  per hectare is 2500  cubic meters . These are 
the answers we get .  
 (Refer Slide Time:  28:37 ) 
 
But, we have another case , where we have to find out the  area that is lost . So, here, 
earlier , we derived it for the 1:1 riser slope in the previous lecture , we derived it . So, let 
us consider the original length AE, which is converted in terrace  bit BD of width W, 
terrace BD of width W, so AE. So, here it i s here , in this case , it will be D and W. So, AE 
in terms of  D and W,  
AB = √(D2 + W2)  
So, the area lost will be the  this is original area , this is the width , we are calculating , and 
this is the original area .  
Area lost (%) = (√(D2 + W2) – W)/√(D2 + W2) × 100  
= (√(22 + 102) – 10)/√(22 + 102) × 100  = 2 
So, in the case of the vertical riser, the area lost is 2 per cent.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:10 ) 
 
Now, we have a case of a 1:1 batter  slope . So, width relationship already we know , we 
derived , and first problem number 1 . So,  
W = D(100 -S)/S = 2(100 -20)/20 = 8 m.  
A length per hectare  will be  it will remain the same , because we  in the b ottom , it will be 
W plus D. So,  
L = 10000/(W+D)  = 10000/(8+2) = 1000 m  
The length remains 1000 meters , but the width is lower now , which  is an important point 
to note .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:52 ) 
 
An earthwork  per hectare will be 1250  D., And in place of D, we are writing  in terms of 
WS for a 1:1 riser.  
= 1250D = 1250 WS/(100 -S) = 1250 ×(8×20)/(100 -20) = 2500 m3   
So, it remains the same , as in the case of riser your vertical riser . An area lost per hecta re 
is the relationship  we derived  in the previous class that is  
= (S+200)/(200/ S + S/100)  = (20+200)/(200/ 20 + 20/100)  = 21.57%  
So, the area lost per hectare is 21.57  per cent. So, here we can see  that, when we use the 
vertical riser , we only lost 2 per cent of the area, but when we are using a 1:1 riser, we 
are losing  almost 21 per cent of the area . 
So, with this , we come to the end of this class . So, we have seen whatever concepts we 
know . With that , we can solve and design solve diff erent kinds of prob lems or design 
bench terraces  for different given cases . So, as we have seen frequently , you have to use  
Manning’s equation frequency frequently ; we have to use  the R ational formula . So, these 
things you should always remember , and a lso the general relatio nships . If you remember 
the equations , that is fine . Otherwise , you can derive also . As I have shown , it is easier to 
derive provided  you remember the principles behind  each one of them . So, it can easily 
derive any of the equati ons. So, I hope that , with this, you will be able to design bench 
terraces . Please do  solve some problems on  your own , so that you are in practice .  
 Thank you very much .
