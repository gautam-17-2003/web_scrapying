Structural D esign of Drop Spillway â€“ 4 
 
Welcome students to our next lecture on the  Structu ral Stability of Drop S pillway against 
sliding . So, in this case , we will in this class we will talk about what is sliding and what 
are the different forces acting  for slid ing, and what are the different resistance forces 
which are responsible for sliding . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:41)  
 
So, we can say that  the different horizontal forces , which are acting of f stream of this 
drop structure against headwall . They are mostly causing the sliding along the plane of 
sliding as you can see  in this figure . So, the hor izontal forces acting on the  structure  in 
the downstream direction having a tendency to slide the structure . And this  H is the 
horizontal force , which is responsible  for sliding along the plane of sliding . And there are  
different sliding resisting forces t his could be friction resistance of the foundation . 
Friction resistance between the sidewall and the earth fill passive resistance of the earth 
downstream from  the toewall  and headwall extension . And hydrostatic pressure of the 
tail water against the headw all and wingwalls during the time of flow.  
 So, you can see this figure , the H  is the horizontal  forces , which are acting or which is  
pushing the structure to slide along this plan e of slid ing. But, there are different resistive 
forces of this found ation material , which is  acting in opposite direction to that of H and 
which is the main cause of stability  of this structure against sliding . Now, we will discuss 
what are the different forces acting on this , and how to compute all these forces . We 
have already d iscussed in our last lecture s that how to estimate the horizontal  forces , 
what are the vertical forces . We can see this diagram the sigma  V is the sum mation of all 
these vertical forces , which is because of the  pressure of this standing water . The vertical  
pressure or the vertical width because , of the earth fi ll or the backfill materials . And the 
vertical forces because of the concrete structure that is the  concrete structure or the drop . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:55)  
 
So, these are the different  horizontal  forces , which is given by   
 
where m u is the coefficient of friction , and that estimated as tan beta, where beta is angle 
of internal friction of the foundation material , because the friction force , which is 
existing at the foundation metal  is the main forc e, which  opposing the sliding of the 
structure , which is causing because of the force H or the horizontal forces . 
Then plus C into A, C  the cohesion  resistance of found ation material per unit area and A  
is the area of plane of sliding . So, you will multipl y C into A, so  that is the cohesive  
 resisting force of the foundation material , so that is also oppos ing the horizontal forces . 
In ideal  condition if H equal to  R H the all those  horizontal forces , it will be equal to  the 
horizontal  sliding r esisting force . So, there wo uld not be any slide , so that is the most 
ideal condition , but that seldom occu rs. 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:19)  
 
So, in this case we have to take some factor of safety . So, the factor of s afety is taken as 
1.5, so  that 
 
In other words , 
 
  
that should be greater than 1.5 . So, everything will be clear , we will solve  a practical 
example . So, will solve this problem , you can get a clear picture how to estimate the 
values of  vertical forces , then horizontal  forces , then take the ratio of that  R H divided by 
H. Then if it is greater than 1.5,  then the structure  is stable against sliding . Otherwise , we 
have to increase the weight of the structure and that is possible by increasing the  depth of 
the cutoff  wall or toewall.   
 (Refer Slide Time: 05:11)  
 
This is a problem the  for solving this  problem,  we have to clear ly understand what is 
given here . So, the problem is that check the stability against sliding of the given drop 
spillway with full flow condition . We have already talked what is full flow condit ion that 
means, the water is flowing over the crest , and the type-b drainage , total fall is 2.5  metre  
relative permeability for f oundation equal to backfill . So, here the ratio is  equal that we 
have already also  solved  similar type of problems . 
And the pro perty of backfill material are angle of internal friction  phi is given as 35  
degree  dry specific wei ght of the backfill material , so that equal 1900  kg per metre cube . 
Moist specific weight of the backfill  material that equal to 2000  kg per metre cube , and 
submerged specific weigh t is given as 1050  kg per metre cube . 
Then the properties of foundation material , which is resisting the sliding  they are given 
by the angle of interna l friction , beta that equal to 12  degree s that is that we can use for 
completing  the mu value , mu equal to tan beta . Then submerged specific weight of this 
foundation material  is 1000  kg per metre cube . Cohesion C that equal to 2440  kg per 
metre square  and specific weight of concrete , because the whole structure is constructed 
by usin g concrete , so that equal to  2400  kg per metre cube , so that will be the useful for  
calculating the vertical weights of different parts of this drop structure . 
And using the figure you  can see , the crest level  water is 0.75  metre , then the  height of 
the he ad wall is g iven by Y  naught  that equal to 2.8  metre from  the plane of that is above   
 the top of this apron , and this is filled with the bac kfill material . And the backfill is case -
C, case-C means it is compacted earth and filled with berm constructed to cr est elevation 
and water table is hi gh. This is for the drainage condition type -b drainage condition , and 
here water t able is high  condit ion. 
And there is tail water , you can see the tailwater depth a bove the endsill  is given us t that 
equal to 0.75  metre , height of endsill equal to 0. 3 metre . So, the tailwater depth above  the 
apron is t plus S that equal to 1.05  metre . And the de pth of cut  off wall equal to 1.2  metre  
and the thick ness of  this apron is equal 0.3 metre , and this distance is 3.3 metre . And the 
plane of sliding is this one that is at the bottom of this toe wall or cut off wall , so that 
means, we have to estimate all these vertical forces and horizontal flow forces in 
reference to this plane of sliding . So, this is the main basic thing , you have  to understand 
before solving the problem .  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:53)  
 
 
Now, we have to go for solving the problem . As a first step, we have to identify  the 
elevation of the situation line Y 2,  because the re is full flow condition  and type -b 
drainage . So, in this case the value of Y 2  will be computed by using the tabular valu e 
that we have already solved in the previous classes . So, from  the table we can see for 
case-C backfill condition , high water table , the relative permeability  of foundation to 
backfil l equal , drainage type -b, and full flow condition the value of    
 
 
So, by using this value we can calculate, what is the value of Y 2 . So, know the values of 
t that is 0.75, S 0.3 and F 2.5, so  you can get 1.425  metre , so that means  this depth is  
1.425 metre. So, this shows that the saturation line lies above the apron  at a dis tance of 
1.425  metre that mean this backfill material is now saturated or submerged . And this 
backfill  material is moist , because it is no more saturated . And this depth is computed as  
Y naught  minus  Y 2 that equal to 2.8  minus 1.425, so  that is 1.375 . So, this depth i s now 
1.375,  which is the moist backfill . 
Now, the pressure difference will be there . So, for this depth Y 1, you will be getting the 
weight because of mo ist backfill  and for the dept h Y 2, you will be  getting  the vertical 
pressure or horizont al pressure because of the saturated or submerged back fill. And for 
depth Y 3  equal to  1.2 metre , we will have water pressure as well as submerged  
founda tion. And there will be tail water pressure for a depth of t plus s equal to 1.5  metre , 
which is acting in op posite direction to that of H. And there will be wate r pressure 
because of this crest  water level of H equal to 0.75 metre . Once this is clear , then we 
have to g o for our next step.  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:37)  
 
So, here you have to identify the , what are the different horizontal pressure s or the  what 
are the different vertical pressures  without that w e cannot solve the problem . So, for that  
as discussed  I was discussing that water pressure have crest , it will e xert horizontal  
 pressure as well as vertical pressure , so because of this water depth  of 0.75 metre . The 
horizontal water pressure , what will be created that will cause the flow of the water to the 
downstream side . So, there i s no headwall here , so because of that  the horizontal pressure 
is 0. B ut, because this  water column , it will be exerting down or water pressure . And that 
will be transmitted to the backfill  material for a  depth of Y 1  as well as for a depth of  Y 
2. 
Then second is the pressure due to the mo ist backfill  metal up to this d epth, which is 
both vertical as well as horizontal . The vertical weight will be transmitted to the 
downstr eam saturated or submerged soil layer , which is of depth  Y 2 equal to  1.425  
metre . Then for this depth , you will be getting submerged weight , and that is also 
causing horizontal pressure as well as vertical pressure .  
Then the pressure due to tai lwater above the apron  so, this one i t will be causing the 
pressure in the opposite direction . Pressure due to su bmerged foundation here that is for 
a depth of Y 3 equal to 1.2  metre , you will be getting the submerged weight as well as 
water pressure  of at this location , which is causing horizontal pressure forces . So, by 
using this concept now will  be solving our  problem .  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:49)  
 
So, this is the whole pressure diagram . We can see  F 1 if the pressure that is water 
pressure , which is  flowing  above the cro ss above  the crest . And this water pressure  is 
giving a vertical load to the top soil layer , so because of that we will be getting a  
 rectangular p ressure diagram . Now, the force F 2  is the pres sure at the horizontal 
pressure , which is  because of the moist soil or the moist  backfill material . 
Similarly , the value  F 3 if will see , so this F 3 the magnitude of  F 3 will be equal to 
because this pressure , because of water a nd this pressure from the mo ist backfill , they 
will t hey will get transmitted to  the lower soil layer , and will be getting  F 3 as a 
horizontal  will be getting a rectan gular pressu re diagram . And the backfill material  in 
this zone  Y 2 equal to 1.725  metre depth will have also , it is own  horizontal pressure , so 
that is given by your F 4. 
And you know that  in all the se pressure triangle s, when solve d the base of these pres sure 
triangle gives the value of pressure force that equal to  gamma into H,  the specific weight 
in time s the depth of this  soil column or  water column . If want to  complete what is your 
total force that i s F, then we have to  multiply  or we  have  find out wha t is the area under 
this pressure  triangle . So, that will go half , into pressure , into the height , so you will  be 
getting the total area . And total area gives you the force value . And this  F 5 is the water 
pressure , because  this water is this  the depth is now saturated , because this is a sa turation 
line because of type -b drainage . 
F 6, we have already talked about . This is your tail water pressure , because as tail water 
here, so that is causing horizontal pressure forces also . Then we have F 8 and F 9 ;  F 8 is 
the horizontal pressure force , which is  because of the foundatio n material , which is 
submerged and F 9  is the water pressure in this submerged  foundation , which is having a 
depth of Y 3 that equal to 1.2  metre . And F 7 will be the transmitted vertical pressure 
from  F 5. Once thi s is clear , so the we can see that total 9 forces  along with the 9 forces , 
these are the 9 horizontal forces , then there other vertical forces as well as the uplift 
pressure forces . Which is also the main cause of sliding , because it reduces the vertical 
force  component , which is opposite which is  working in a opposite direction .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:23)  
 
 
Now, in the thir d step , we have to  we have to estimate the ratio of horizontal to vertical 
pressures for the backfill material , because here phi equal to 35  degree alrea dy given in 
the problem . So, you will  be getting  K b 
 
   
= 0.271   
that means, if you have some vertical pressure to convert that v ertical pressure into 
horizontal pressure , we have to  multiply with  0.271 for the b ackfill material . And for 
foundation material ,  
 
=0.656  
which is equal to 1 minus sin 12 degree divided by 1 plus sin 12  degree . So, in the 
foundation material to convert the vertical forces into a horizontal forces , you have  to 
multiply the vertical forc e with  0.656,  then you can get the value of horizontal forces .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 18:19)  
 
 
Now, in ste p-4, you have to estimate  the horizontal  pressure forces above apron . So, all 
the forces are computed for unit width  that means I am taking one meter wid th, which is 
normal to the plane of paper . So, at crest level , the water depth is 0.75  metre . So, you 
will get vertical  pressure that equal to P  w, so will get  
 
So, gamma w the specific weight of water you know that it is 1000  kg per metre cube 
into 0.75  metre the water depth , so will get 75 0 kg per metre square . 
So, this water pressure , because there  is no  head wall at the above the crest level . So, is 
not exerti ng any  horizontal water pressure , but it is exerti ng the vertical water pressure , 
which getti ng transmitted to t he bottom soi l layer that is to a depth of Y 1 that equal to 
1.375  metre . So, for that you wi ll be getting the  F 1 pressure diagram as  rectangular 
pressure diagram . So, at 1.375  metre below crest in the mo ist backfill  that means, at this  
reference line the horizontal pressure due to the transmitter water pressure  on top will be 
equal to  K b times  P w, K b we have estimated a s 0.271  in the previous slide . 
 
And that  you have to multiply with the P  w that is the vertical pressure , which is coming 
from the  top because of standing water level , so that vertical pressure is converted into  
horizontal pres sure force by multiplying with K  b,   
 
 
so that equal to 203.25  kg per metre square , so that is it will convert into  ton per metre 
square it is c oming 0.2033  ton per metre square . So, you can see this value as  0.2033  ton 
per metre square , so that means  this length of this pressure diagram is  0.2033.  So, total 
force  will be equal to this result 0.2033 times Y 1, so  this is  the height of this force . So, 
you will be getting  total area  as Y 1 into P  w 1, so  you will be getting 0.2795  ton, so that 
is the area of the pressure rectangle .  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:17)  
 
 
 
 
 
Now, we have to  estimate what is the value of F 2.  So, for F 2 the vertical pressur e due to 
the mo ist weight of backfill material is given by gamma m into Y 1. G amma m is the 
specific weight of the backfill material , so that equal to 2000  into 1.375, so  that equal to 
2750  kg per metre square . So, this is within the moist soil , which is a bove the saturation 
line. So, this vertical pressure has to be converted into equivalent h orizontal pressure , so  
 that is given by P  m that equal to  K b times  P v m, so that means we have to m ultiply 
with 0.271. So, by multiplying with  0.271  will be getting  P m equa l to 0.7453  ton per 
metre square , so that you can see also here , in this figure tha t is 0.7453  ton per metre 
square . 
So, the total area will be calculated as the area of this  pressure triangle . So, the area of 
the pressure  triangle will be base th at equal to 0.75 7453  into the height that is 1.375 
divided by 2, so  that the area  of triangle you know this . So, F 2 will be equal to 0.5124  
ton so, this the area of the pressure triangle . So, we have compute already  F 1 and F 2 
once this F 1 and F 2 are computed , so the whole value the vertical value will b e 
transmitting to the next soil layer  that is Y 2. 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:03)  
 
 
 
So, our next step is to compute , what is my vertical forces at 2.8 metre below crest in the 
submerged backfill , because  this Y 2 depth is totally submerged . So, total vertical 
pressure transmitted f rom the top , so that is denoted by P v s 1, so  that will be equal to 
vertical  pressure due to water above cre st, this value plus vertical pressure due to the 
moist weight of bac kfill material  that equal to P  v m. So, this value  so total will be  
 transmitted , so total will be equal to 750 plus 2750, so  that equal to 3500  kg per metre 
square , so that means  this value is now 3500  kg per metre square . 
Now, this value has to be convert ed into equivalent  horizontal forces , so that we can do 
by using multiplying this value with the value of  K b, we have already done before . So, 
K b value equal to  0.271  for the backfill material . So, now  you multiply  0.271 with 350 0, 
so you will be ge tting 0.9485 ton per metre square . So, this is the of value of P s 1 , so 
that means, this value is now  9485, so  that is the you can see width of this pressure 
rectang le is 0.9485 . 
And what is the depth you  calculate d the area , so depth is  Y 2 this value , so this the 
depth . So, we will get the area of this  pressure rectangle  now, so that equal to F 3 . So, F 
3 will get 0.9485  into 1.725, so  that equal to 1.6362 . Now, similarly we will g o for 
calculation of pressure F 4 . So, the press ure F 4  is caused because of th e own weight of 
this submerged backfill of two  depth 1.725 metre . 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:15)  
 
 
 
  
 So, the vertical pressure due to the submerged due backfill material  will be given by 
gamma s into Y 2 . So, gamma s is the specific weight of the submerged backfill  that is 
1050 into 1.725, so  will ge t 1811.25  kg per meter square . So, this is the vertical pressure . 
Now, this has to be converted into the horizontal pressure force . So, by multiplying with 
K b, so we wi ll get P s 2  that equal to  K b into P v s 2, so that will get 0.271 into 1811.25  
that eq ual to 0.4909  ton per metre square . So, we can see this va lue is 0.4909  ton per 
meter square . 
So, this basis base of this pressure triangle F 4 is now  0.4909.  So, we have to calculate 
the area of this pressure  triangle , area of this whole triangle  so that is equal to base into 
the height equal to that equal to Y 2, so  that is  1.725 . So, multiply 1.725 with 0.4909 
divided by 2, so  will be getting  0.4234  ton so  that means, this F 4  value  is equal to  
0.4234  ton.  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:53)  
 
 
 
Now, we have to estimate the value of F 5. So, F 5 is caused because of the water 
pressure in the submerged backfill , so that you can compute a s P w 2 equal to gamma w 
Y 2, so that equal to 1000 into 1.725, so  that equal to 1.725 ton per metre square . Now, 
we have to es timate what is the value of this  pressure area related to 5 corresponding to  F  
 5. So, F 5 will be equal to half into base , base is equal to 1.725  into the height  Y 2 is 
equal to 1.725 . So, will get  1.4878  ton, so now you have calculated what is the pressure  
F 5.  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:49)  
 
 
 
Similarly , we have to calculate what is pressure  F 6. F 6 is the water pressure because of 
the tailwater . So, simple way you can estimate that equal to  gamma w into height of this 
tail water , so that equal to t plus S,  so that equal to  1.050  ton per metre square . So, here 
we can  see this is 1.05  ton per metre square . Then we have to estimate what is the area of 
this pressure tria ngle to calculate the value of F 6 . So, for th is we have  to estimate , you 
have  to multiply 1.05  with the height of the tail water t hat equal to 1.05 , then into half of 
that so, will be getting  0.5513  ton.   
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:37)  
 
Now, we have to estimate what is the values of  F 7, F 8,  and F 9 . So, for that  you have  to 
calculate at 3.1  below cr est in the submerged foundation that is along the plane of 
sliding . So, along this plane of sliding , we have to  estimate what is the total horizontal 
pressure . So, the horizontal pressure exacerbated by  the foundation material from the top 
equal to vertical pressure due to water above cre st, this water pressure plus vertical 
pressure due to moist  backfill , this pressure  plus vertical pressure due to submerged 
backfill , so this pressure . So, total will be  equal  to as we have estimated before  5311.25  
kg per metre square . So, this is the horizontal pressure , which is because of the 
submerged  foundation .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:41 ) 
 
 
 
So, the horizo ntal pressure corresponding to P v s 3  will be equal to K f into P  v s 3 . So, 
those pressures w ere vertical pressures , whatever we have  calculated those are vertical 
pressures not horizontal pressures , so that is the correction , we can  change to vertical 
pressure . So, we have to multiply with  the value of K  f, so 
 
  
we have computed before that equal to 0.656 . So, 0.656 times 5311.25  that is the vertical 
pressure , which is exerted to the foundation material . So, will be getting  3.4842  ton, so 
that you can see a lso from the figure that is 3.4842 ton per metre square . 
So, then we have to get what is the area of the pressure triangle . So, the area of the 
pressure  triangle  will be  3.4842 into half sorry 1.2, so  this valu e is 1.2. So, we will get 
the area of the pressure triangle , so that equal to  4.1810  ton. So, the value of  F 7 is equal 
to 4.1810  ton.   
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:53)  
 
 
 
 
Now, we have to estimate what are the values of F 8 and F 9.  The vertical pressure due to  
submerged foundation mater ial above plane of sliding , so that is equal to we have 
already computed , so gamma s f into Y 3. So, gamma s f is given as 1000 into 1.2, s o, 
will get 1200  kg per metre square . So, we have to convert  this vertical weight  into 
equivalent horizontal pressure forces . So, we have to  multiply this w ith K  f. So, K f we 
have  estimated as 0.656 times 1200  will give you 0.7872  ton per metre square , so that 
you can see from this figure this value is 0.78 72  ton per metre square . 
Then we have to calculate  what is the area of this pressure  triangle . So, area of this 
pressure  triangle  will be hal f into the ba se that is equal  0.7872 into the de pth is Y 3 that 
equal to 1.2, so  will get 0.4723  ton. And the next pressure will be our water pressure , 
which is in the  foundation metal b ecause of depth of 1.2  metre .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 32:19)  
 
 
 
So, the water  pressure will be given by gam ma w into Y 3, so  that will be equal to  1000 
into 1.2 that equal to 1200  kg per metre square . And you have to convert into pressure 
triangle area of the  pressure  triangle , so that will be equal to  half into 1.2 into 1.2 is this 
the value Y 3, so  will get 0.72  ton. So, you have already computed all these horizontal 
pressure forces . 
(Refer Slide Time: 32:43)  
  
 So, our some of these horizontal forces will be equal  
 
This F 6 is negative , because it is exerti ng the pressure  in opposite direction , which is 
against the sliding force . So, total we will get  9.1613 ton that equal to 9161.3  kg. So, 
once this pressure forces  has been computed  now, will go for computation of our vertical 
force s. 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:15)  
 
We have alr eady computed  in our previous class  that h ow to estimate the total vertical 
forces . These are the different vertical forces as shown in the diagram . The force V 2  is 
because t he concrete head wall , because it a concrete structure , so because the concrete 
headwall , whic h is having a depth of 2.8  metre , and the thickness is 0.25  metre . So, the 
area of this cross sectional  area of this  headwall will be equal to 2.8 into 0.25 into 1  
metre . We have taken 1  metre or as width which is normal to our  plane of paper . So, will 
be getting 1680,  it will m ultiply with 2400  kg per metre cube , which is the specific 
weight of  concrete .  
Similarly , the force V 3  is the  due to the concrete apron. So,  we have total length is  4.55 
metre into 0.3  the thickness of thi s apron into 2400,  you will get 3276  kg. Similarly, V 4  
is the concrete cut off wall  this force , so that will be equal to similarly we can compute 
that equal to 1008. V 5  is the concrete toe wall , similar way we can  compute the area is 
0.3 into 0.35 into 2400  sorry 1.25 into 0.35 into 2400 you will get 1008 .  
 Similarly , for end sill that is your V 6 that we computed 252. For submerged backfill it is 
the speci fic weight is 1050  into 0.55  for is depth  into 1.425 for a depth of Y 2, so  that is 
coming as  822.94. F or the  moist  backfill that is V 8,  so the width is 0.55  metre , because 
of the all the pressure will be acted on the str ucture . The structure is elongated up to a 
depth , length of  0.55 metre . So, all the pressures will be acting on this only on this  
structure . So, for the mo ist backfill  we will be ge tting it is 1512.5, because 2000  is the 
specific weight of this  moist backfill .  
(Refer Slide Time: 3 5:49) 
 
Then V 9  is the water above crest , which is also causing the vertical force , so that equal 
to 412.5.  V 10 is the ta il water above apron , so that equal to  3517.5,  because 3.3 metre is 
the length of this apron . V 11  is the tail water above end sill . So, the tail water above end 
sill will get this value . This is the tail water above end sill , so you will get 262.5  in the 
similar way if you compute , because t is 0.75 into 0.35  is the this thickness . So, you will 
get 262.5 . 
And the other forces li ke V 12, V 13, V 14 and V 15  all are the vertical forces , which are 
acting upward direction . So, all will be in a negative forces . And he re the pre ssure 
diagram is given , the pressures  are given here  1720, 1640.99  13 15 32.46 and 1424.88.  
So, this pressure forces will be mu ltiplied with the area . So, for V 12 the area is 0.55 into 
1 which is acting on this . So, you will get 5  sorry 94 6.  
 Similar ly, for V 3  the uplift force w ill be equal to 0.35 into 1  that is the area into 1640.09  
this value  so, will be getting 574 . For V 14, similarly it is 3.3 metre is the length of this 
apron , so on this structure it will be acting . So, for this we h ave t o multiply 1532  this 
value with  3.3 into 1, so  that is  5057. S imilarly , we can compute for V 15, so  that equal 
to 498.7  kg and all these forces are the uplift forces are negative . 
(Refer Slide Time: 38:07)  
 
 
 
So, now you can compute what is the tot al resultant vertical forces  which is acting on 
this structure . So, the total resultant forces will be equal to the sum of all this process 
from V 2 to V 11 minus V 12 to V 15, so  that you will get as 6676  kg. Now, the 
horizontal sliding resisting force can be computed as we know this formula that is R H  
equal to m u into sigma V plus C A, so  that will be equal to  if you put m u equal to tan 12  
degree , so will get the value as  9471.4  kg. And the ratio you can g et as 9471.4  w equal to  
R H divided by 9161.3,  so we will get 1.034  value , but this value is  much less than 1.5, 
so because of that the str ucture is not stable against sliding . 
So, this is very if  R H equal to R  that is ideal case , so in this case  the ideal case is not 
generally prescribed . So, for that this structure you can say that is  not stable agai nst  
 sliding . So, this ends our lecture  here so, in this lecture we discussed that how to 
calculate the sliding  condition . The stability analysis , we have carried out  again st sliding . 
So, for that you have t o estimate what are the total horizontal pressure forces , total 
vertical forces including the uplift pressure , then take the ratio between  R H and V . So, if 
it is greater than 1.5,  then the structure is stable against sliding . Otherwise , this is not you 
have to redesign the structure again , so that this will be a slight  stable against sliding . 
Thank you very much .
