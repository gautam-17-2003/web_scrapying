Basic of Ope n Channel Hydraulics – 2 
 
Hello friends , welcome back to NPTEL  online certification course on Soli W ater 
Conservation Engineering . I am Rajendra Singh Professor in the A gricultural and Food 
Engineering Department of  IIT Kharagpur . We are in week 6 lecture 30 and the topic is 
Basics of Open Channel Hydraulics part -2. 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:37)  
 
To give you an overlook of what we have covered in this week up till now . We started this 
week with lecture 26, where we introduced gully control measures . In lecture 27, we 
focused on gully control measures with respect to permanent s tructures . In lecture 28, we 
dealt with design considerations for permanent gully control structures . And lecture 29, 
we went through the basics of open channel hydraulics part 1. And today’s lecture is a 
continuation of that that is basics of open channel  hydraulics part 2. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 01:15)  
 
Last time we discussed the concept of specific energy , and today we continue with  the 
application of specific energy concept s especially  with reference to flow over a raised 
hump . So, the case is suppose d there is a channel where there is a raised hump certainly a 
raised hump comes this is the concept  I also mentioned is used in  broadcasted (Refer Time: 
01:41) also.  
So, if upstream depth and discharge are known , that is at this any point upstream which is 
point 1 here. If depth and  discharge are known then specific energy concept s can be used 
to find the velocity and depth over the hump . So, the velocity a depth over the hump can 
be found out by knowing the upstream conditions . And that is because of the appl ication 
of specific energy concept s. 
So, if you apply  Bernoulli’s  energy equation over section s 1 and 2. Section 1 you 2 notices 
is the hump where the hump height is delta z. Assuming  horizontal rectangular channel 
that is Z1 equal to Z2 and taking alpha equals to 1, that is in Bernoulli’s energy equation . 
So, we get  
𝑦1+𝑉12
2𝑔 =𝑦2+𝑉22
2𝑔+∆𝑧 
So, basically here  so elevation head is not there . So, it is the  pressure head and velocity 
head pressure head in velocity head that is there . And of course, this z is  in will part of the 
depth of flow , because the depth of flow is less  so here due to this hump  so this is equation 
number 14. We are  continuing with the equation number earlier  equation number .  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:03)  
 
𝐸1=𝐸2+𝑧 
𝐸1− 𝐸2=𝑧 
𝑦1+𝑉12
2𝑔 =𝑦2+𝑉22
2𝑔+∆𝑧 
𝑦1+𝐸1 =𝑦2+𝐸2+∆𝑧, so 𝑦1+𝐸1= 𝑦2+𝐸2 
So, in terms of specific energy because we know that specific energy is nothing , but y 1 
plus y plus V square by 2g. So that means equations  say 14 can be written as  y𝑦1+𝐸1 =
𝑦2+𝐸2+∆𝑧. So, point A on the specific energy curve  corresponds to section 1. So, 
section 1 where the depth is very high and if you go here this is the point on a specific 
energy  curve if you draw for this flow then this is  specific energy  for this point a 
corresponds to a flow depth on the upstream side . 
However, as seen point  B or B dash may  present section 2. So, both these 2 points have a 
because here you see the  energy  the depth is  z and energy here is  E 1. W here in this is  E 2 
that there i s a difference of delta z from this equation . So, E 1 is E 2 plus delta z . So, this 
is E 2 plus delta z is E 1. So, that is what it is  so this E 1 corresponds to section 1 and E 2 
corresponds to section  2, but the same energy  E 2 is obtained at two points  B and B dash.  
Then the question is which of these two  B or B dash represents section 2. So obviously, 
we can say that point  B corresponds to specific energy  and flow depth at  section 2 because 
in between section s 1, 2 there cannot be two points where  E 1 minus  E 2 is equal to delta 
z. So, because the difference between  these two is delta z  so between this point and this 
point there cannot be  another point . So, that is why this point basically represents section 
2. So, point A corresponds to section 1, and point  B corresponds to section 2 on the specific 
energy curve .  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:03)  
 
So, if you take the example a rectangular channel with a flatbed and width of 5 meter s and 
maximum depth of 2 meter s has a discharge of 10 cumecs . The normal d epth is 1.25 
meters . What is the depth of flow  in a section in which the bed rises 0.2 meter s over a 
distance of 1 meter ? Assume that frictional  losses are negligible so  that means we have 
been given channel bed width is 5 meter s, discharge is  10 cumecs or  cubic meter per 
second , y 1 is 1.25 meter , that is normal depth is given and delta z, that because there is a 
rise bed rise is 0.2 meter . So, delta z is 0.2 meter s. So that means we can for a ramp case 
we know that from  a specific energy concept , E 1 is equal to  E 2 plus delta z .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 06:03)  
 
So, w e also know that E equals y plus V square by  2g so that means for E 1 section 1 we 
can write  E 1 equals to  y 1 plus V 1 square by  2g or y 1 we can replace V by Q by A. So, 
y 1 plus Q square  divided by  2g A1  square and we know the value of  y 1. W e know the 
value of the loss  discharge  Q and cross -sectional area because we know the bed width , we 
know the  depth of flow . So, cross -sectional area  By, we can found out find out and value 
of g is also known . So, everything is known here  so by putting the values we get  E 1 equals 
1.38 meters . 
Similarly, specific energy at  section 2 assuming the depth of flow Y 2, we can write in 
terms of y 2, E 2 is y 2 plus Q square by  2g a y 2 square or  y 2 plus 10 square ; that it 
becomes  Q equals to 10, 2, 9.81 5 y 2 square ; that means if we simplify we get  y 2 plus 
0.2 by y 2 square. A nd we know that  E 2 equals E 1 minus delta z from the previous 
equation and  so y 2 plus 0.2 y 2 square which is here is equal to 1.38. T hat is E 1 value we 
have already obtained and the z delta z value we all know 0.2. So, from here  y 2 plus 0.2 
by y 2 square is 1.18, and because  y 2 is the only  unknown  so we can solve by trial and 
error and we get a value of  y 2 equal to 0.96 meters . 
So, this shows that the water level at  section 2 is 1.16;  that is 0.2 from the bed elevation . 
So, 0.2 which is a jump  ramp , ramp height plus 0.96,  that is 1.16 meters . And there is a 
drop of 9 centimeter s in water level due to a 20-centimeter rise in the bed . Because the 
upstream flow depth is 1.25 meters  to 1.25 meters , wherein the flow depth at the ramp is 
including the ramp height is comes out to be 1.16 meter s. So, there is a drop of 9 
centimeters in water  level due to a 20-centimeter rise in bed . So, that is one of the concepts 
of the specific energy because using specific energy we can find out the flow depth at the 
ramp .  
(Refer Slide Time: 08:37)  
 
Then we come to hydraulic jump  is a hydraulic jump  is defined as a rise in the  level of 
water in an open  channel . So, if the water level rises suddenly then this phenomenon is 
referred to as hydraulic jump . And it occurs when water flowing at a high velocity  is 
retarded to a  slow velocity . Suddenly if  the flow is supercritical that is flowing at a very 
high velocity , then if it is retarded because of a certain region then ; obviously, there will 
be a sudden rise in the  level of water and that is referred to as a Hydraulic J ump.  
(Refer Slide Time: 09:19)  
 
And t he slowing of water leads to an increase in height that changes the kinetic energy of 
flow into  potential energy . And in the process some of the energy dissipated in the form 
of heat due to  turbulence . So, basically , the hydraulic jump phenomen on is used f or energy 
dissipation and is often designed to occur over  dam spillway  so on the downstream side of 
the dam spillway where the water flows with a very high velocity .  
Then we  create a condition such that hydraulic jump occurs and energy is dissipated  so 
that the downstream channel remains safe . Also below the sluice gates in the channel  so if 
the sluice gate is there , then also because of the flow conditions changing drastically there 
will be hydraulic  jump formation . And also occurs when the channel slope changes from 
steep to miles . So, wherever there are float condition s changes therefrom supercritical to 
subcritical , then we have the  hydrologic jump phenomena taking place .  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:27)  
 
So, if we try to analyze hydraulic jump ; hydraulic jump involves  large energy losses . 
Energy or specific energy equation  cannot be applied because  we saw that energy remains 
more or less  constant  in the specific energy previous equations whenever we saw  we 
neglected the losses  or there were mino r losses because of the friction . But because of the 
hydraulic  jump phenomen on, a lot of energy  loss is there  so, that is why we have to apply  
the momentum equation in this case . So that means, if we consider a control volume  
containing the hydraulic jump here, then we have to  consider the forces  acting on this 
control volume . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:19)  
 
So, if we consider that then ; obviously, because of the velocity of flow there is a force 
acting in the flow direction , flow is taking in this direction . And then hydraulic jump 
phenomena occur  so that means there is some retardation and then a flow force is created 
which acts in the opposite direction . So, the  
𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡  𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒  𝑖𝑛 𝑥−𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝐹1−𝐹2, and momentum change will be  obvious , 
if you consider momentum in section 1 is  M 1 and section 2 is  M 2. So, the momentum 
change s 𝑀1−𝑀2, and for this  momentum equation the  momentum change equal to  a total 
change in the  forces . So, from this , we can write  𝐹1−𝐹2=𝑀1−𝑀2 
(Refer Sli de Time: 12:09)  
 
𝐹1=  g 𝑦1
2𝑦1𝐵 
𝑀1= Q𝑉1=  Q𝑄
𝑦1𝐵 
Or we can  rearrange and write  𝐹1−𝐹2=𝑀1−𝑀2=𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡 . And if you consider a 
rectangular channel then  F 1 that is a force at  section 1 is pressure times area . And the 
pressure is basically gH. So, gH basically if it is a rectangular section then force x at 
the center . So, the center of the depth  so that is why, if y 1 is  depth and the  y1 by 2 that 
will be centroid . So, rho g  y1 by y 2 and the rectangular channel  so, y 1 time B is the  depth 
of the cross -sectional area . 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:53)  
 
Similarly, if you consider momentum  in section 1, then momentum is mass into velocity . 
And mass is nothing , but  times  Q, and velocity is V1. So, again velocity we can w rite 
in terms of  Q and cross -sectional area . So, Q and cross -sectional area , so B y1 so this is 
what it is . So, similarly , if we can write  𝐹2=  g 𝑦2
2𝑦2𝐵 and 𝑀2= Q𝑄
𝑦2𝐵. So, we are 
now writing everything in terms of  Q and y .  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:33)  
 
And if we equate  that and we rearrange the terms with a little bit of manipulation , we get 
this formula ; we say that   
𝑦2= 𝑦1
2(√1+8𝐹𝑟2-1) 
And important thing is that here  Fr is the Froude number  we remember , remember the 
earlier we used  F for Froude number , but because here in the momentum equation , F is 
being used to represent force . So, if that is why we are writing  Fr, so F r1 is Froude number 
at section 1.  
Basically , it means that Froude number at section 1. So, y 1 and y 2 are conjugate depth  so 
using this  relationship , we can find out knowing if we know the Froude number ; that 
means, the velocity of flow and the  depth of flow our discharge in the  upstream section . 
They can then we can find out the conjugate depth  in the hydraulic jump .  
Similarly, if we manipulate this equation a little bit then ; the energy loss in the hydraulic 
jump can be obtained in the form of this relationship that is ,  
∆𝐸=(𝑦2−𝑦1)3
4𝑦1𝑦2 
So, if we know the  conjugate depth we can find out how much energy  loss is taking place 
in hydrology up phenomena . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:57)  
 
And also  based on experiments  the length of a hydraulic jump , that is distance which is 
measured from the front face of the jump to  point on the surface immediately after the  
roller . So, basically here from here to this is the place . So, this is nothing , but this is the 
long length of the hydraulic jump .  
And this length is experimentally determined  a 6 y 2 and that is true only when  F that is 
Froude number remains between 4 and 20. So, the Froude number is 4 in 20 the 
experiments showed that within this range length of the hydraulic jump was 6 times y 2. 
So, if we know the  y2 we can also find out what is the length of the hydraulic jump .  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:45)  
 
So, we now come to practical applications of  hydraulic jump phenomena . Hydraulic jump 
is used in the design of stilling basins for energy dissipation and  as we know stilling basins 
are used as a terminal structure in a spillway . So, many times we have talked about apron 
basically this apron , and this stilling basin is also  x is a n apron in a structure . So, stilling 
bases are used as a turbulent structure there is the last structure . So, the flow falls on this 
apron and it is expected the hydrogen phenomenon will occur and ene rgy dissipation will 
take place .  
So, stilling basins are designed in such a way that hydraulic jump is created  so that a high 
level of kinetic energy is reduced through dissipation and by a transfer to potential energy 
due to greater  subcritical flow dept h. So, we know that in the hydrologic phenomena the 
flow depth rises . So obviously, the kinetic energy gets converted into potential energy , and 
also bec ause of the roller formation and so on a lot of energy further dissipated . 
So, this helps in  controllin g scour and erosion of the downstream  channel because if a very 
high-velocity flow will go into the downstream channel , then that might cause erosion 
because you remember every time when we design grass water we always talked about the 
non-erosive velocity . So, we always want to focus on nonerosion velocity or we want to 
have control velocity  so that erosion can be minimized . And that is what happens here that 
when hydraulic jump phenomena occur , we do  not want very high flow velocity to go into 
the downstream channel and that is why we see that we put  or stilling basin . So, that 
hydraulic jump phenomen on occurs the  kinetic energy gets converted into potential 
energy , and because of this conversion process lot of energy loss takes place .  
And the velo city of flow gets reduced . So, that downstream section of the channel  remains 
safe from scour or erosion . Flow at the lower end of the spillway of a dam is  usually 
supercritical . Since the flow in the channel do wnstream is usually subcritical. H ydraulic 
jump forms near the base of the spillway . So this is what we are talking about because of 
the very high flow and because we are seeing that the velocity is retarded . So, there will 
be a rise in the water level and that is why in between hydraulic jump phenom ena will take 
place .  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:27)  
 
Now, the downstream portion of the spillway must be designed . So, that hydraulic jump 
always forms on the concrete  structure itself . So, the concrete apron which we provide 
here that is here . The hydraulic jump phenomena  must occur within the confines of this 
apron . If hydraulic jump forms  downstream of the contact  concrete structure say for 
example, instead of in figure A it is happening here , but if it forms build beyond this apron 
then severe  erosion of f oundation material could  undermine the dam and cause complete  
failure of it .  
So, that is also an important design consideration that when we design a pronounced 
stilling basin , we must always see that hydraulic jump phenomena  do occur over the apron 
or the concrete  structure itself . And U.S. B ureau of reclamation ha s standardized the 
stilling basin designs and this we will see when we  discuss later on when we go into the 
design of  in a greater way  we will see all these design s of stilling basins and all little later 
maybe later in the  course .  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:45)  
 
So, let us take one example ; a hydraulic jump occurs downstream from a 15-meter wide 
sluice gate . The upstream depth is 1.5 meters and the velocity is 20 meter s per second . 
Determine  the Froude number and the Froude number corresponding to the  conjugate 
depth , the depth , and velocity after the jump , and the energy loss in the jump . So, all these 
we have to find out . So, we have been given the data given are velocity upstream velocity 
is 20 meter per second here and upstream depth that is  y 1 equal to 1.5 meters .  
So, the Froude number for upstream section  F 1 is V 1 by root g  y 1 that  is a standard 
equation . We know V 1, we know g , we know y 1. So, while  putting the value we get the 
Froude number is 5.2 and this is greater than 1. So, the flow is supercritical  which  is very 
important to notice . And once we know  y 1 then  and we know the  y1 and we know the 
Froude number . 
Then we know the equation to find out the conjugate depth that is  y 2 equals y1 by 2 square 
root 1 plus 8 F r 1 square minus 1. So, we know further  the Froude number  upstream 
Froude  number which is here , and y 1 that is the depth of flow we know . So, by putting 
the known values here we cal culate  y 2 comes out to be 10.3 meters . So, that means the 
depth of flow goes up from 1.5 meters to 10.3 meters in the hydraulic jump phenomena .  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:23)  
 
And then of course so from the continuity equation , we can calculate V 2. So, it is V 2 is 
A 1, B 1,  A 2, B 2. So, 1.5  times  20 and then divided by 10 by 3. So, we get 2.9 meter s per 
second  that are the velocity of flow . And drown stream Froude number then can be found 
out B 2 by root g y 2. So, V  2 is known g is known  y 2 is known  so, we can put the value 
is 0.29.   
And using the  equation the energy loss can also you find out this is a standard equation  y 
2 minus  y 1 cube  4 y 1 y 2 y 2 is known  y 1 is known  so by putting the value we can find 
out and delta E comes out to be 11 meters . That the flow depth goes up from 1.5 meter s to 
10.3 meters and there is a n energy loss of 11 meters in the hydraulic jump phenomena . So, 
that is what we get  from this problem .  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:28)  
 
Another example we can take water on a horizontal  apron of a 30-meter wide spillway that 
has a depth of  0.2 meters and a velocity of 5.5 meter s per second . Determine the flow depth 
after the jump the Froude number before and after  the jump and power dissipated within 
the jump . So, V  1 is given  y 1 is  given so here also at  section 1 Froude number can be 
found out V 1 by the square root of g  y 1 putting  the values  we get  F 1 equal to 3.9.  
And then using the standard equation we can find out conjugate depth where  y 2 equals y 
1 by 2. A  square root of 8 plus 1 plus 8 F r 1 square minus 1, y 1 is 0.2. If the F value we 
have obtained is 3.9. So, by putting these values we get  y 2 equals 1 meter . So, here flow 
depth goes up from  0.2 to 1 meter . 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:31)  
 
And continuity section here  so here we can find out  a 1, v 1, a  2, v 2 and from here we can 
find out that comes out to be 1.1 meter s per second . So, downstream  Froude number will 
be F 2 that is V 2 by the square root of g y 2. So, V  2 is known , y 2 is known  so this value 
comes out to be 0.35 so it is a subcritical flow less than 1. In an energy loss equation , we 
know  y 2 minus  y 1 cube  4 y 1 y  2. So, these values are  y 2 y 1 is  known  so we can put the 
value  and we get a n energy loss of 0.64 meters . What we have to find is the power 
dissipated . And power dissipated we know is gamma  Q H gamma value we know is 1000  
kg per cubic meter .  
Q is area times velocity , so we can find out here  and H is we have found out that is the 
total energy loss . So, from here we get it is 21120  kg meter per  second . That is the total 
power dissipated an energy loss was 0.64 meters and power dissipated 21120  kg meter s 
per second in the hydraulic jump phenomena . So, this is how we can design how much 
energy is being g ot dissipated or (Refer Time: 24:48) power i s getting dissipated and  so, 
on in the  hydraulic jump phenomena .  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:56)  
 
So, now we come to a gradually varied flow . So, in a rapidly varied flow hydraulic jump 
phenomena because they are the flow they have changes over a very short di stance . And 
that is how  with the distinguished rapidly varied flow and gradually varied flow . It was 
assumed that the friction losses are insignificant , reasonable because rapidly very flow 
occurs over a short distance . But since gradually varied flow occurs over a  long distance  
friction losses are considered .  
So, that is a major difference here . The r apidly varied flow w here say  occurs over a very 
short distance  so friction losses are negligible . Very gradually varied flow because  the flow 
that is the other depth etcetera changes over a long distance  so friction losses are 
considered . And a specific energy curve shows that for a given  Q there are two flow depths 
that are possible in a steady flow . And from Manning’s equation , all the time we have 
found  one depth , and that depth is referred to as a normal depth .  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:00)  
 
𝐴𝑐
𝑇𝑐=𝑄2
𝑔𝐴𝑐2 
So, the consideration of channel slope and friction helps us in deciding whether this flow 
is subcritical or supercritical . So, we have to calcula te the  normal depth using Manning’s 
equation and we have to calculate the critical depth using the equation we have already 
seen critical depth  formula  so critical depth we can calculate . So, y n may  be greater  less 
than or equal to y c .  
So, these two depths we have calculated y n and second depth is y c . So, first is calculated 
by Manning’s equation , second is the critical depth by using standard formulae and then 
we have two depths . So, then these two values  y n may be greater less than or equal to y c 
which is quite obvious . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:43)  
 
 And if that is  so then for a given channel in roughness if  y 1 is equal  to y c that is possible 
only, if the slope of the channel is critical because only at critical depth because critical 
depth is only one and  so normal depth will be equal to critical depth only if the  slope of 
the channel is critical  so this is one  finding . Second is if the slope is le ss than the critical 
slope  that is here and y n is greater than y c that is normal flow depth is greater than critical 
flow depth that is this is the normal flow depth . So, this is y c this is a here it is  here if it is 
y n and then  obviously, we can calcu late the critical depth for any given flow condition . 
So, the flow will be subcritical and the slope will be called mild . So, if s g is less than s 0 
that the bed slope is less than critical slope  and y n that is normal depth is greater than 
critical depth then the  flow will be subcritical that is here and the slope will be mild on the 
other hand if the slope is greater than s c that is here and y n is less than y c . So, here you 
see y c is line is a dashed line where is  y 1 y n has come down .  
So, this is  y n. So, this is y c y n . So, y n is less than y c then flow will be supercritical and  
the slope will be steep . So, from mild to steep slope , if we go flow changes from subcritical 
to supercritical . On the other hand , it is just reverse that is from the steep two -mile slope 
you go then also flow changes from supercritical to subcritical and in this case hydraulic 
jump phenomena take place  so this these are the changes .  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:39)  
 
And considering the energy equation , equation 2 of lecture 29 that very common  equation 
that is  y 1 plus V 1 square by  2g s0 delta x and  y 2 plus V 2 square . So, for as reach of delta 
x in length defining  S f as friction slope that is  hl by delta x . So, the only change in this 
equation is the equation of h L we are writing S f delta x in terms of  friction slope S f so 
this is equation number 19. And if we say delta y is equal to  y 2 minus  y 1 and  V 2 square 
by 2g minus  V 1 square by  2g is d by d x V square by  2g delta x .  
And if we put this in the equation num ber 19 then we get  y 2 y minus 1 that we are bringing 
on this side  so this is becoming delta y . This is 0 minus S f also we are bringing on this 
side as . So, as z minus delta  minus delta x coming on this side we are in this  V 1 square  
by 2g we are taking o n this side . So, it becomes v two square minus this thing and then we 
can write  this term here . So, it is d by d x V square by  2g delta x equation number 22. So, 
simple manipulations  of the terms  on the left and right -hand side s.  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:07)  
 
So, dividing the entire equation by delta x and taking the limit as delta x approaches 0 we 
get d y by d x plus d by d x V square by  2g is equal to S 0 minus S f. A nd the second term 
can rewrite as d by d y V square by  2g times d y by d x . So, from here  d y by d x  and that 
is d y by d x and d y by d x . we can take common  and then we can write for d y by d x d y 
by d x will be S 0 minus S f.1 plus d by d y V square by 2 g.  
So, we are just  manipulating this term a little bit instead of writing d by d x we  are writing 
d by d y and then d y by d x . So, that basically it means the same , but then it helps us in  
finding out d y by d x a single term . Now, this equation d y by d x is simply t old what 
depth change in depth with x so ; that means, it tells us the wa ter surface profile how the 
depth changes with distance basically this equation , but this equation can be  converted into 
more usual form  if the denominator is expressed in terms of Froude number and that is 
why we do a little bit of manipulation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 31:25)  
 
And then finally, we can write this equation as d y by d x equals to  S 0 minus S f divided 
by 1 minus  F r square  F r is Froude number . So, now we have d y by d x in terms of S 0, 
S f, and Froude number , and this is a general differenti al equation for  gradually varied 
flow and this is used to describe the various types of water surface profiles that occur in 
an open channel . So, using this one can find out the water surface profiles .

So, if you take an exampl e water flows in a river shown in the figure with a uniform  bottom 
slope . So, slope this bottom slope is inform total depth at each section is measured by using 
pitot tube as indicated . So, here in the center of the channel and its certain height and here 
center option is certain height total head is the measure . The v alue determine s the value of 
d y by d x at a location , where the Froude number is  2.75. So, these are the values that are 
given to us and the distance between the two sections is 1250  meter s that are also given to 
us.

So, this equation , 
𝑑𝑦
𝑑𝑥=𝑆𝑜−𝑆𝑓
1−𝐹𝑟2 
So, we know that  y 1 plus V 1 square by  2g plus S 0 I said this is the basic equation we 
are writing , or from here S 0 minus  S f is 1 by delta x , y 1 plus V 1 square by  2g minus  y 
2 plus V 2 square by  2g. W e are doing it  because these values are already available from 
pitot tube measurement and delta x is also known . So, that is why we can calculate  S 0 
minus S f directly .

So, by putting the values   ∆x =1250, y 1 V 1 square by  2g value is given , to difference is 
191.5 -189 for say ing this section and for the second section  this comes out to be 2 meters . 
So, S  0 by S f is 1 by 1250  and 2.5 minus 2; that means, 0.0004 putting the value of S 0, S 
f, f r in 2.75.  That is where we have to find out the profile depth . So, d y by d x comes out 
to be 0.0004 divided by 1 minus 2.75 square or we get a value of minus 6 into 10 to power 
minus 5 and minus value shows that there is a fall in -depth as we move towards the channel 
for the given condition .  
So, that is how we have seen now in this case  first the application of  the energy concept , 
then we went to  the rapidly varied flow in the form of hydraulic jump . We saw the concept 
of hydraulic jump its application . And then finally, we moved into the gradually varied 
flow and  so saw how the fundamental equation of gradually varied flow could be used for 
designing the water surface profiles .  
And all these concepts are very useful when  we go into designing various  permanent gully 
control structures and we will see this application . So, I will expect that you will go through 
this part very carefully and keep some of the basics in your mind because that will be 
helpful when we design the structures . 
Thank you very much .
