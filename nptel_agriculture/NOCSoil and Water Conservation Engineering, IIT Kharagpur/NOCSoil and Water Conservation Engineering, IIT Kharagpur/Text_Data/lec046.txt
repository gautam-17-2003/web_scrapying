Chute Spillway Design – II 
 
Hello, good morning . So,  we in earlier chapter we studied  design  spillway or designing 
of the spillway the part I, now we are going to continue the Design of the Spillway the 
part II. 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:31)  
 
So, here we cover some of  the basic  concept and also the design problems that we 
completed  partly at a desig n problem I. (Refer Slide Time: 00:41)  
 
 
So, here we designed the component  3 that is chute or the discharge carrier ; that is one of 
the component  of the chute spillway . So, here we have t o calculate the critical depth ; so, 
critical depth  is calculated u sing the discharge of the spillway and the length of the 
spillway using  this equation . 
So, y c or the critical depth  as you know from the principle of fluid mechanics it  is a 
quadratic squa re root and cube square upon g  and this comes out to be  8.77 metre . Now 
the depth at the top of the spillway was calculated to be  4. 2 metre  that is based on the  
slide 17 in design problem I. So, this 4.2 metre is less than  the critical depth ; hence the 
flow at the top of the spillway is supercritical . (Refer Slide Time: 01:43)  
 
 The chute channel or the discharge carrie r should , now be given a mild er slope fo r a 
little distance from the toe , but in no case this  should  be less than the critical slope . So, 
the flow remains to be a supercritical  then the critical velocity  V c is q the  critical 
discharge divided by y c ,  
 
which is the critical depth . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:11)  
  
 
So, this i s the critical discharge is  80.7 that we  calculate d in earlier step . And y c this one 
is around  9.18 metre per  second , but what we know  from the manning  this one , from the 
floor in a  channel . So, this relation  
 
so, we plug everything here . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:45)  
 
 
So, a rectan gular channel with bottom width of  62 metre should be provided a chute  
channel for the chute spillway . So, at a critical flow ; so, this is the area of the channel , 
so, b into d . 
So, we calculated from earlier step this b that assuming the channel is a trapezo idal and a 
critical depth is  8.77 and weighted perimeter we calculate again the weighted perimeter which  is again  b plus 2 d we calculate here . So, the hydr aulic radius is A by P; so, we 
everything going to plug  into the equation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:47)  
 
 
 
So, we everything plug  going to plug  here into the equation . So, we calculated  the 
weighte d perim eter and the area of the channel cross section . (Refer Slide Time: 03:59)  
 
So, now the critical slope we like this we calculate the critical slope here. So, which i s 1 
upon  428 it is a reverse curve  a slope of say 1 upon 250 used to be provided at a 25 metre 
distance from the top of the spillway . Since the crit ical slope is come out to be  1 upon  
428, so  we gave a distance of  25 metre  at the top of the spillway and then we pr ovide 
slope of 1 upon  250. So, bed level at the end of this slope is 190.4 from ear lier 
calculation in design 1 divided  minus 25 by 250, a 190.3 metre . A reverse curve at the 
toe may have a radius equal to twice H e, which is twice and H e was calculated from 
previous step ; so, it is around 27.5 m etre. 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:05)  
 Now we have to construct a table for the design problem . So, from this point onwards 
relative level of 190.3 metre  and up to relative level of  103 metre ; the slope of a 
discharge carrier may be steep ed depending upon the site contour . 
A slope such as  8 is to 1 to 4 is to 1 may be given in the init ial stage and then a steeper 
slope say  2 is to 1 and 3 is to 1 is to be given . So, the given design is like a rectangular 
channel whatever whenever the slope is change d, the transition curve  as we learned 
earlier  the conv ex or concave in shape maybe design ed. In the  given  question since the 
site contours are not known before hand , so we shall assume that a slope  of 6 is to 1 is 
given for first 21 metre fall , like up to a relative level of 169.3 metre and then a slope of 
say 2 is to 1 is given for the rest of the rea ch. 
(Refer Slide Time: 16:17)  
 
So, like this we have to  have to  construct a table where calculat ion of water depth of the 
chute  channel or  the discharge career is to be  solved . 
So, this is in a slope of  2 is to 1 and then  this is w e again we  calculate using the  our 
assumed value and here we  the column 18 the actual TEL level . So,  we compare the 
value at column  10 versus column 18, so  in the next slide we  explain this . (Refer Slide Time: 06:55)  
 
So, at the  depth velocity et c at the end point  of 1 in 250 slope maybe taken to be  same as 
they were at the to e of the spillway because the small length of 25 metre shal l produce a 
much d ifference . So, with this assumption that TEL at the starting point of new  slope 6 is 
to 1 is equal to  213.21 minus 0.1 metre that is  213.11. 
Now the calculation of water depth  velocity etc now can be carried out for entire reach . 
So, the relative level of 190.3 to relative level of  103 metre  of the discharge carrie r and 
now we divide the en tire channel  length into small small reaches . So, we divided the 
entire channel length  here in a small small reaches say  at an interval of  42 metre  and we 
calculate each of these  quantity the velocity ; velocity heads specific e nergy and we 
compare this wit h the column  8, the actual  TEL water l evel. 
Now the column  18 as I explained  earlier  is then compared with column  10 and they 
should  approximately equal . If the dif ference is larger than the assumed is depth is 
changed till a equivalence  is obtained . So, it is a trial and error procedure and once t his 
one say  the actual level is similar to the calculated levels ; so, our design is almost  
accurate . So, here you can see at the last end of the  channel means we divided at a  small 
small interval of  42 metre . So, at the end ; so the column a  10 is approximately equal to  
column 18; s o, now these assumptions our assumptions are correct . (Refer Slide Time: 09:05)  
 
 
 
Now, the design of curve number 1 at the junction of  250.1 and 6 is to 1 slope since the 
slope is now  from  my steep er to mild er, a convex curve shall be provided . So, the convex 
curve is designed as per the equation . So, this was the equation given  earlier and K is 
assumed as 1.85; so, which is also given in slide  18 in chute spillway design part 1. 
And d plus h v is the specific energy at a junction point , hence the specific energy as you 
know  it is given by the d plus v square the kinetic head . So, we plug it here and tan phi is  
the angle the slope of the angle of the  floor upstream of the junction point  which is the 
slope 1 is to 250. (Refer Slide Time: 10:01)  
 
Now since the tan phi  is very small now cos square phi  is also  approximately unity since 
tan phi is here is 1 upon  250, cos phi is also we can approximate it as 1 and here you get 
a convex curve and then the slope profile is . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:35)
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So, we plug everything here ; so, we get  here x tan phi is 1 upon  250 in this case  x square  
1.5 and we assume this one also as unity . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:07)  
 
So down to this form of the equation it  is a quadratic equation ; now since we are dividing 
the channel reach into small small section , so, we differentiate  y with respect to x . 
So, we get a d  y by d  x since it is  we differentiate its  2 x and then we get into this form  of 
equation . (Refer Slide Time: 11:35)  
 
The curve meets  the down stream slope where d y by d x is minus 1.6; the negative sign 
shows that as x  increases the  y also decreases . So, we plug it here sorry this ; this thing 
will be  2 x it is a small correction . So, it will be  69, 68 point something there  is a small 
correction here please note . So, we plug it everything here and we get the value of x as  
11.3 metre . 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:25)  
 So, other coordinates of this curve for val ues of x is between 0 to 11.3 metre is 
determi ned based on this equation ; so, y is negative  of cours e as given below  in the table  
5. 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:37)  
 
So, it comes out like th is. 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:47)  
 
 Now the design curve number  2 at the junction of  6 is 1 slope and  2 is to 1 slope . From 
table  4 the specific energy at this poi nt is find out to be d  plus h v  that is  38.75 metre . 
Now since tan phi is 1 by 6 the cos phi  is approximately 1; so, y equal to minus x by  6 
with plug everything here . 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:13)  
 
And we the equation  and then after  getting y value we differentiate with respect to  x 
here. So, it meets t he downstream slow at slope of  2 is to 1 and since d y by d x is minus 
1 by 2 we solve it lik e this . 
So, it comes out to be 38.75 metre ; so, this po rtion here . (Refer Slide Time: 13:43)  
 
 
It means that the  convex curve shall become  a tangential to the slope of  2 is to 1, after 
travers ing a distance of 38.75 metre . The coordinates  of this curve can be found out from 
x equal to 0 to x equal to 38.75 metre using this equation and the values are shown in 
table 6. 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:07)  
 So, this is the  value as shown in the table  6 at x equal to 0 metre ; what is the 
corresponding  value of y ; so, y will be in downward shape . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:17)  
 
 Now the position of the stilling basin for energy dissipation by hydraulic jump from 
table  4 the dept h of the TEL water level . So, d equal to  2.015, F is Froude number and F 
1 is 9 metre . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:35)  
 So, provide  the basin tail water dept h 50 percent  more than the conjugate dept h; 
conjugate depth as we remember y 2 and y 1 both as the Froude number is large at a 
depth 1.05 into y 2. 
So, we assume that we  designed that  tail water depth as 50 percent more than the 
conjugate depth or the y 2. So, 1.05 y 2; so, y 2 is 24.7 and if  I increase it 50 percent  
more ; it will be around  1.05 oh this ; so it will be around 26 metre . 
Hence floor level of the  jump basin is  103 minus 26, that is 77 metre and USBR  stilling 
basin is to be provided here . 
(Refer  Slide Time: 15:31)  
 
So, this is the complete  design . So, first we designed  profile this one and then t he control 
structure or the  ogee where . And then we sorry then we proved the  convex curve here 
that is slope of  6 is to 1 and first convex curve and the n we p rovide a second convex 
curve that is  6 is to 1. And this is the curvature and the slope of this convex curve is 
shown here . So, this complete s your design chute  spillway . 
Thank you .
