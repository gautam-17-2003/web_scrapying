So, let us start with question number 1 ; two triangular channels  A and B , have  the sam e 
bed slope , roughness coefficient and depth of flow. The side slope of channel A is 1 
horizontal to 1 vertical while that of B is  two horizontal  to 1 vertical. Find the ratio of  
discharges in channels A and B. So, we have 2 triangular channels  other than the side 
slope , rest of the characteristics of the same. And we have to find the ratio of discharges 
in these 2 channels . So, let us take  let us see how  we handle this problem . (Refer Slide Time: 01:11)  
 
So, if we  take the case of  data which is gi ven, so, we hav e channel section triangular for 
channel A,  Z is 1 ; for channel B,  Z is equal to  2. Now , this is the typical  cross -section 
triangular cross -section, where the depth of flow is d side slope with z. And  top width at 
the water surface is small t, and with freeboard , the total depth is capital D , and the top 
with long  ultimate top is capital T . 
So, if you remember , we discussed  various formulae ; a table was provided in one of the 
lectures where we saw that for a  triangular channel , A is zd2, wher e z is the side slope , 
and d is the depth of water d here . And P is 2d(z2+1)0.5. So, this side is d(z2+1)0.5 and 
then there are 2 sides , so that is why it is two times of that.  
And also , from the continuity equation , we know  Q = AV; that A is cross -sectio nal area , 
V is the velocity of flow .  
So, for channel A area using the equation A = zd2, value of z is 1, so A = d2. Similarly , 
wetted perimeter P will be  
P = 2d(12+1)0.5 = 2.83d  
And hydraulic radius here radius R we know is the ratio of cross -sectional ar ea A and 
wetted perimeter P. So,  
R =  A/P = d2/2.83d = 0.353d  Similarly, for  channel B where only difference is the value of z is 2 ,  
A = 2d2 
P = 2d(22+1)0.5 = 4.47d  
R =  A/P = 2d2/4.47d = 0.447d  
Now for channel A , putting the value  of A and  R. Basically A and we know that V 
equals 1/n R2/3S1/2, and we also know that n and S are remaining constant. So, basically , 
in this equation , if you put the continuity equation we put , it will be Q equals to  A×1/n 
R2/3S1/2. 
So, for channel A , 
QA = d2×1/n RA2/3S1/2. 
Similarly for  channel B , 
QB = 2d2×1/n RB2/3S1/2. 
So, if you we have to ca lculate the ratio of discharges Q A by Q B. So,  
QA/QB = ½ (RA/RB)2/3 = ½ (0.353d /0.447d )2/3  = 0.427  
So, the ratio or discharges of channel s A and B is  0.427. So, that is the final answer  to 
this question. So this is how  we can  solve this problem . (Refer Slide Time: 05:46)  
 
Now, we take the second question,  question number  2, which says that a triangular 
shaped  grassed waterway with a longitudinal slope of 2.5 per  cent is to carry a disch arge 
of 1.5 cubic meter s per second, with a permissible velocity of 1.2 meter s per second. The 
side slope of t he channel is 1.5 :1, which  is horizontal is to vertical . Without  considering 
freeboard  calculate the  top width of the channel. So, you know that  this is what it is , so if 
this is  what it says is that  this is  d and this is  t. So, we do not have to  consider any  
freeboard here  and this is the value of t  we need to calculate that is the problem says with 
all the data given.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:38)  
 So, if you look into the solution , we have been given Q equals 1.5 cumec, z is side slope 
z is 1.5 , bed slope S is  0.025, permissible velocity V is 1. 2 meters per second , and 
channel section is  triangular. And for triangular sections  channel section just n ow we 
saw, 
A = zd2; P =  2d(z2+1)0.5; t = 2zd  
So, from continuity question again , Q equals to A V, Q value is given here, V is  given 
here. So, area comes out to be 1.5 /1.2 or 1.25 square meters. So, z d2 is the  area of a 
triangular section. So,  
zd2 = 1.25 
1.5d2 = 1.25 
d = 0.91 m . 
And we know that t = 2zd, the value of z is known  d we have calculated. So, by putting 
the value here . 
t = 2×0.91×1.5 = 2.73 m  
So, the top surface water surface width, basically it is nothing but the water surface width 
at the top is 2.73 meters that is the second question  answer  of this question . 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:23)  
 Then we go into question number 3,  and again a trapezoidal gross waterway is 
constructed along with  a longitudinal gradient of  4 per  cent. If the cross -sectional a rea of 
flow is  1.5 square meters, the wetted perimeter  is 12.5 meters , and Manning’s  n for the 
water is  0.04 m-1/3s, or the second  calculate the flow through  the waterway. So, Q = A/n 
R2/3 S1/2, this is the equation we have to use . 
So, here the longitudina l gradient is given 4 per  cent, the cross -sectional area is already  
given 1.5 2 square meters, the wetted peri meter  is 12.5 meters . So, also, we know the 
hydraulic  radius is  A/P. This is just without going into a detail ed solution just so that if 
similar pr oblems come , this is how we have to attack the problem. So, A by P is given , P 
is given so we can calculate the value of R  n value is given. So, that way all , everything 
will be known ; the only thing we need to calculate is  R-value where A and P values are  
already given. So, this is how we can easily solve this  problem. So,  let us go into the 
solution part of it . 
(Refer Slide Time : 09:51)  
 
So, see a longitudinal slope is 4 per  cent, the cross -sectional area  is 1.52 square meters, 
the wetted perimeter  is 12 .5 meters, Manning’s n is 0.04  units. Hydraulic radius we said 
that saw that we have to calculate the hydraulic radius that is  
R = A/P = 1.52/12.5 = 0.1216  
So, velocity of flow we can calculate separately  V = 1/n R2/3 S1/2 = 1/0.04 (0.1216 )2/3 (0.04)1/2 = 1.23 m/s  
And continuity equation Q equals AV, and the area is given as 1.5 and velocity we have 
calculated  1.23. So, the  Q value comes out to be  1.5×1.23 =  1.87 cubic  meter s per 
second. So,  that is the  answer to this particular  problem , so very straightf orward , simple 
question . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:54)  
 
Then question number 4, says that determine the most efficient  trapezoidal section of a 
drainage ditch  required  to carry a peak runoff of 1.6 cubic meter s per second. The 
challenge is constructed in  alluvial soil , having Manning’s roughness coefficient of  
0.025. The bed slope  and side slope of the channel  are 1:2500 ; 1:1.5 vertical  to 
horizontal. So, this is a tricky thi ng typically . We use horizontal is to vertical, but in this 
probabilit y, given vertica l is to horizontal.  
So, we have to be careful while reading the question  that there might be a few tricks 
involved. So, this is the trick here that instead of  giving horizontal eastward cut , it is 
even vertical i n two horizontal, but the meaning remains th e same  from here the  z value 
will come out to be 1.5 only respectively. So, we have to basically get a design or  
determine the most efficient  trapezoidal section  in this particular problem . (Refer Slide Time: 11:59)  
 
The data given are discharge Q is equa l to 1.6 cumec side slope value just now we saw, 
which was given vertical is to horizontal, but the meaning remains the same. So, the 
value of z is 1.5 ; bed slope is o ne to 2500, Manning’s n is 0.025 and channel section is 
most  efficient trapezoidal. And i f you remember , in one of the  lectures earlier , we 
derived the equations for the most efficient trapezoidal section , which  is the  most 
efficient hydraulic section or a most economical section . 
And found there were three  conditions the . One of the  2 of cond itions are listed here that 
is B, the relationship between  B and D, that is , bottom  width and the depth of flow is  
B = 2/√3 D & R = D/2  
So, these 2 relationships will develop the third was of course, if you remember  though 
this is if  this is the drawing,  and this is B  this is Z  is to 1 . So, we know that  this portion  is 
nothing , but this is D; this is Z D. So,  this portion is D2 + ZD2 or D√z2+1. So, this is what 
it is, and the top width is  Z D. This time all this type of this side also it is Z D. So, the top 
width is  B+2ZD. 
So, we found that half of the top width that is  B+2ZD that is half of that  is equal to the 
side length, which is D√z2+1. So, this was the third condition. So, there were 3 
conditions  1, 2, and 3. And in this problem , we need to use these 2 , that is B relationship between B and D and  R equal to D /2, because we have to use the Manning’s equation 
and the continuity equation . 
So, from here , the cross -sectional area of the ditch is a trapezoidal section we know that 
cross -sectional area is given as 
A = BD + ZD2 
 and then putting B in terms of d and the  value of Z , which is given as 1.5 here. We get , 
A = 2/√3 D2 + 1.5  D2 = 2.655D2 
The v elocity of flow V = 1/n R2/3 S1/2 S, and n value is given as 0.025 . R is given  in terms 
of D for the most economical section or most efficient trapezoidal section ; this is D /2, so  
V = 1/n (D/2)2/3 (1/2500)1/2 = 0.5D2/3 
So, we  know area in terms of D we know velocity in terms of d from this equation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:39)  
 
So now,  what we have is we know Q equals 1.6 cumecs , area is 2.655 D2, and V is 
0.5D2/3. So now, we have to put use the continuity equation that if Q equ als to A V, by 
putting the values of Q , A and V in this equation we get , 
1.6 = (2.655D2)×(0.5D2/3) = 1.327D8/3  
So obviously, from here , we can write D  = (1.6/1.327 )3/8 = 1.07 m  
So, from here  the value of D comes out to be 1.0 7 meters so; that means, B whic h is the 
relation  with the D ;  
B = 2/√3 D = 1.24 m  
So, we know d , we know B , and we can add a fre eboard of 20 per  cent. So, the depth , d 
comes out to be 1.25  meter s. So, without  freeboard , the value of D and  B are here. And if 
you add the 20 per  cent free board, then the total width  depth of the ditch comes out to be 
1.28 meter. So, this is how we have  to we can calculate the  most efficient section.  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:50)  
 
So, we go into question number 5, which says that it is proposed to construct benc h 
terraces on a 10 per  cent hill slop e. If the batter slope is half horizontal to 1 vertical, 
determine the percentage area that will be  lost for cultivation  due to bench terracing. So, 
this is a bench terrace problem where we have to calculate the area lo ss due to the 
construction of bench terra cing. (Refer Slide Time: 18:23)  
 
we derived earlier that area loss under bench terraces when the batter slope was 1 :1. So 
now, we have to see the same relationship  when the batter slope is  ½:1. So obviously, we 
know that we took that D the vertical interval  of the benches  on a land with the S per  
cent slope, along A B. So, A B is basically the original slope or length over which 
cultivation would have taken place had the benches had not been laid . 
So, because benches are being laid where the batter slope is ½:1. So, that simply means 
what; this is this portion we know is  the depth of cut or so, it is a refer ence to it, 
basically , if you consider  just horizontal , so it is  D/2. And because this slope is 1 :1, If the 
slope  is ½:1, decimall y this portion will come  out to be D /4. So, D /4 here and D /4 here 
both side D /4 is there because of the risers slope and the battery rider  is 1. L is the 
horizontal interval between  the benches that is the  projectile length of  AB on a horizonta l 
plane. That is this is L, this is from  here to here,  this is  D, this is D , and this is L ; so, for 
this triangle bigger triangle if you consider . (Refer Slide Time: 19:55)  
 
So, actual distance A B, basically which is  if we consider triangle  here, the triangle 
between  this is the triangle we are considering  A this is B basically, A BC, AB which is L 
is basically this is L ,  this is D . So, it is  
AB = √(L2+D2)  
and then  we said that we w ould expand .  
AB = L(1+D2/2L2+D2/8L4+…..) 
And then we only consider  the first two terms way we can be taken as   
AB = L + D2/2L 
So, this is the simplification or assumption we are making that  only first two terms are  
useful. (Refer Slide Time: 20:35)  
 
But we know that  
L = 100D/S  because from  fig; this is D , this is L , and this has a S per  cent slope. So, this 
is S/100, so by equal it triangle , we can see that D /L is equal to S /100 or L equal to 
100D/S, so th is is what we are using. And so A B is we know that we have already 
derived equation ,  
AB = 100 D/S +  (D2/2)×(S/100D)  
 = 100D/S + DS/200  (Refer Slide Time: 21:27)  
 
Now , if W is the width available for the cultivation of terracing , so,  
W + D/2 = L = 100D/S  
W = 100D/S – D/2 = (200D -DS)/2S  
That set the width of the terracing if it is half is to 1 riser slope.  
So, a width  that is not available for cultivation is A B-W. We have calculated  AB, we 
have calculated W. So, we are putting t his equation ,  
= 100D/S + DS/200 – 200D /2S +DS/2S  
 = DS/200  + DS/2S  
So, this is the width that is not available for cultivation, and this is the width we have to 
use as a numerator for calculating the percent ages. (Refer Slide Time: 22:16)  
 
So, with width loss expressed in percentage  of original s o this is what we calculated. And 
this is the original value of  L basically . 
= (DS/200  + DS/2S ) / (100D/S + DS/200 ) × 100 
Eliminatin g D from numerator and denomin ator 
= (S/200  + S/2S ) / (100/S + S/200) × 100  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:10)  
 And then , we can fur ther simplify by dividing the numerator and denominator both by  
100S; the width loss comes out to be , 
= (S+100)/(200 /S +  S/100)  
If you remember , for a 1:1 or batter slope , we derived this relation ship like this. So, the 
numerator denominator remains the s ame in a numerator . We have 200 in place of 1 00. 
So, you can very well see that when we have a 1 :1 batter slope , then area loss would be 
much more . 
And so the percentage  is taken  as percentage width is taken a percentage a loss. So, by 
putting  the value of  S percentage , your loss comes out to be 5.47 per  cent. So, when we 
use ½:1 battle slope , and if the land slope is 10 per  cent, then the total area  that will be  
lost due to  bench terracing is 5.47 per  cent, that is the answer to this particular problem . 
And if you  remember the formula , then you can straight away get the answer  frequently . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:19)  
 
Then we go to question number 6, which says that bench terraces are to be constructed 
on a 15 per cent hand -land slope. The  batter slope is 1 :1, and the vertical interv al is 2.5 
meters. Earth work in cutting  is equal to filling. Find the  quantum of Earthwork in cubic 
meter s per hectare. So,  this is a straightforward probl em, where we have to use the  
relationship  for Earthwork.  (Refer Slide Time: 24 :46)  
 
And h  this is here for a batter slope of 1 :1; 
D = WS/(100-S).  
Putting the value of D in S , we can calculate W ,  
W = D(100 -S)/S = (2.5×85)/15 = 14.17 m.  
So, Earthwork per  hectare for a  riser 1:1 is 1250 D , and this comes out to be , 
Ew = 1250 WS/(100-S) = (1250 ×14.17 ×15)/85 = 3125.7 m3 
In fact, we can straight away  use 1250 D without doing  any of these manipulations . That 
is 1250  times  the D value , which  is 1250 ×2.5. So, we will get the same a nswer , so 
straight away , in a single step , this problem can be solved. And it comes out to be 3125.7  
cubic meters . There is that total Earthwork involved . 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:38)   
Then we take another question 7 ; bench terraces are to be  constructed on a hill having  a 
15 per  cent slope . If the vertical interval  of the terrace is 1.5 meters, calculate  the length 
of terrace per hectare, Earthwork , an area lost  when the battle  slope of the terrace  is 1:1. 
So, 1 :1 is the battle slope, and length the 15 p er cent slope is there, and the vertical 
interval is given 1.5 m eters . We have to calculate length, Earthwork and area lost all 3 . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:11)  
 
So, the data g ave our land slope 15  per cent vertical interval  1.5, but slope 1:1. So, the 
width of the bench terrace we know for the 1:1 batter slope is given b y; 
W = D(100-S)/S = 1.5(100 -15)/15 = 8.5 m.  The length per  hectare ,  we know for 1 :1 is 10000 /(W+D). So, we know, D we know  so 
we by putting it we get 1000 meters . So length per actually 1000 meters of the terrace . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:50)  
 
And the Earth work per hectare will be  1250 D. So, 1250 times  D, and it comes out to be 
1875 or 1875 cubic me ters, so it is the Earthwork per hectare. And area lost  per hectare 
just now we saw for 1 :1 batter slope this was the relationship we derived earlier in a 
class.  And so S value  by putting S value of 15 per  cent we can calculate , and we get the 
answer as , 
Area lost  per hectare   = (S+200)/(200 /S +  S/100)  = (15+200)/(200 /15 +  15/100)  = 
15.95%  
So, these are the three  answers 15.95 per  cent and earthwork  1875, and the length is 1000  
meter s. 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:36)   
And we take the  last question that is question number 8, that is  if the width of the bench 
terrace is W, the drop is D , and the existing land slope is S; then for 1 50 per cent batter 
slope, derive the rel ationship that expresses drop is a function of W and S. So, this is a  
relationship we need to draw here in this case . 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:05)  
 
So, basically , the batter slope is giv en as 150 per  cent or 1.5:1 . 
So, here  basically for deriving this relati onship if you remember we earlier we used 
equivalent triangle concept, because land slope  so we have a triangle M a nd A. And then 
we have a because of this  batter of 1.5:1 ; this is D by 2. So, this portion will be 1.5 times 
D by 2 or 3 D by 4 , basically 3 D by 4. And the W basically will start from this place W, 
width of the terrace will b egin from this place please remember we are whenever we had. In the case of riser  at a battle slope, then a battle slope was there then we took the width 
from this place . 
So, basically from the equivalent triangle , 
(D/2)/(W/2+3D/4) = S/100  
So from here , if we cross multiply  and if we divide this by 2 ; 
100D = WS + 3DS/2  
From here , if we take th ese D terms here . So 100D, and this is nothing but 1.5 S,  so 1.5 S 
here, and  W  remains on the right hand side . 
D(100 -1.5S) = WS  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:24)  
 
So, from here this D (100-1.5S)=WS , or from here ,  
D = WS/(100 -1.5 S ).  
So, this is the derivation . This is the relationship  which we are  we have been asked to  
delay . So, this is th e basically answer  of this particular  problem . So, this shows that,  this 
way we have seen th at, we have  solved various kinds of problem that has been asked in 
great question paper on  grass waterways and the bench terraces  where many times sometimes we have  to derive a relationship sometimes we have to remember a 
relationship. And sometimes  the th eoretical aspect because we derived what is the most 
economical section, what is the  area lost when the righteous slope is 1:1. 
So, there might be little bit variat ions like this in this one question was half is to 1 the 
other question at 1.5:1 . So, if you have to understand how relationship fundamentally is 
being derived and even if you do not remember the formulae , you can easily derive the 
formula using the first principles. So, that is why if you practice more problems , the 
more variety y ou will come across, and it will be easier for you to attack the problem in 
any examination situation.  
Thank you very much.
