Problem s on Graded Bunds  
 
Hello friends , welcome to NPTEL online certification course on  Soil and Water 
Conservation Engineering.  I am Rajendra Singh,  Professor in the Agricultural  and Food 
Engineering Department  of IIT Kharagpur . We are in week number 3 , lecture 15 . And 
today, we will be solving problems on graded bunds . We saw the princi ples o f 
components of graded bunds. In the previous lecture , today , we will utilize them to solve 
Problems on  Graded Bunds . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:50)  
 
Just to give you an idea of the course content, which we have gone through . This 
particular week  we st arted  this week with lecture 11 , where  we introduced bunds;  then, 
in lecture 12,  we went through contour bund; that is , design parameters, design principle, 
design considerations  and lecture 13. We applied those  design parameters considerations 
into solving some o f the problems, dealing with the design of contour bunds . 
In the previous lecture, that in lecture 14 , we covered graded bunds  and today, we will be 
solving problems on graded bunds .   (Refer Slide Time: 01:26)  
 
Let us start with problem number 1 , which r eads a 350 -meter -long graded bund  has been 
proposed to be constructed  on a land of 3 per  cent slope. So, the length of  the graded 
bund is given as 300 meters , and slope land slope is given as 3 per  cent the type of soil is 
sandy. So, the soil we have to we  are dealing  with it is sandy soil . 
The rainfall intensity of the area  was recorded  as 18 centimetres  per hour  for a duration 
equal to the time of concentration. This is very important . The duration of the rainfall is 
also given . That is, rainfall intensit y is given as 18  centimetre s per hour, but the 
important thing is the rainfall was for a duration equal to the time of concentration . 
And we have to maintain a uniform  grade of point one 8 per  cent along the  bund. So, this 
is also , so it is a graded bund , so that is why a uniform g rade of  0.18 per  cent has to be 
maintained . 
Further , the problem says that assume VI, that is , the vertical interval is  1.25 meters , and 
the runoff coefficient C is 0.35. Using  the above data determine the dimensions  of the 
bund. So, we have to  determine the dimensi ons of the bund  and the dimensions of the 
bund. We saw that simply means we have to design  or decide on the  top width the 
bottom width height side slope of the bund . 
So, this is  typically this is how a cross -section of a  bund looks like. So, what we have to 
decide on  this side slope  and then we have to find out , what is the  bed width  or bottom width ? What is the  top width? And of course,  the height;  so, this is what  the problem 
wants  to design  utilizing the data that is g iven.  So let us  see how to go ahead with this . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 03:38)  
 
Now,  just to have a check on the data which is available with us  length of the bund is 
given as  350 meters , the land slope  is given as 3 per  cent, rainfall intensity for a duration  
equal to  the time of concentration is given as 18 centime tres per hour . The grade of the 
bund is given as 0.18 per  cent vertical interval is 1.25 meters , and runoff coefficient C is 
0.35.  
Now,  in any of such problems we have to where we have to decide on the dimensions of 
the bund . So, the determining factor , of cou rse, is the amount of water the flow  that the 
structure has to handle . In this case , it is the graded bund . So, we  remember the graded 
bunds are designed for safe  this removal of  excess flow , so that means  whatever flow is 
generated over the area between thes e two bunds  is taken off safely  from the area. So, 
that is why the computation of  peak runoff rate becomes the most vital thing this is the 
first thing . 
We discussed how to determine the peak  runoff rate. And we also decided we said that  
for design for  determining the peak runoff rate from any area watershed catchment . We 
use the rational method , which I also mentioned that  you should always remember 
because this is such a  fundamental  thing. A nd this is  given as  Q =CIA/36  
This is the formulae , and also remember, when we discuss this formula, we also said that 
there certain units which we should always remember . So, in this case , Q is in cubic 
meter per second , C is the runoff coefficient which  is the coefficient the value is given 
here in  0.35, I is rainfall intensity  for a duration equal to  the time of concentration in 
centimetre per hour , and A is the  drainage area  in hectares . So, that means  we need to 
know  the C, I, A, and in this problem , C is already given , I is already given . So, we have 
to find out that is the drainage area  and; obviously, because we are talking about the 
graded bunds . So, the area lying between 2  consecutive bunds is the drainage  area we are 
talking about in this case . So, we have to find  that out . So, let us  say let us see how to do 
that. 
So, for doing that , the first thing  we need to remember  or determine is  the horizontal  
spacing  of the bund.  Because  we remember we said that if this  is what we are talking 
about , this is one graded bund . This is another graded bund . So, this is the area we are 
talking about , the area between  these  two.  
So, in this case , obviously,  we decided that there is something called the horizontal  
interval . So, this is a horizontal interval , any corresponding  point we can take into bunds , 
and the  horizontal distance between that is the horizontal interval . So, that is horizontal 
interval  basically , and the length of the bund length will be perpendicular to the board 
basically. So, so this is  what the area we are looki ng for that is the area  where in which 
whatever rainfall occurs  that we have to handle. So, that is why that becomes the 
drainage area  or that that will decide the peak runoff rate , which we have to handle . So, 
that is why the first thi ng we need to  determ ine is  the horizontal interval . 
And we know that from previous class also and also in contour bunds , we know that  
there is a direct relationship between horizontal interval  and the vertical interval  that is  
HI = (VI/S)×100 
Where  S is t he land slope in per cent.  
So, as I also said in the previous class , you really do not need to remember  all the 
formul ae all the time . You can  get many  times you can derive the formula . So, in this case , for us , the vertical interval is already given land  slope is already given as 
3 per  cent that is here . So, data both the unknowns are  given here . So, putting the value 
of VI and S,  
HI = (1.25/3) ×100 = 41.66  or approximately 4 2 meters . 
So, the area between  forms  between 2  consecutive bunds already we have  explained that 
it is HI times  length of  the bund . So, HI is what we have  calculated , and the length of the 
bund is already given . So, 
A = HI × length of the bund  = 42 ×350 = 14700 m2 
But remember , in the rational  formula , the unit required is hectares . And that is why we 
have to divide this by 10000 square meters , that is 10000 square meters is equal to 1 
hectare you remember . So, by doing that , we get the area as 1.47  hectares that is a 
drainage area .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:57)  
 
And once the drainage are a is known,  then we can put the value in  
Q =CIA/36  = (0.35×18×1.47) /36 = 0.26 m3/s 
This is the discharge  graded  bund system has to handle. So, this is an important  finding 
for us . Now, let us come to now we know what the discharge th at our system has to h andle is . 
So now, we can go  ahead and decide on  the components of the  graded bund or the cross -
section , basic ally. So, the first thing we decide is the  side slope of the  bund  and that I 
have already seen  that is the type of soil  is sandy. So, the side slop e of the bund will be 
1.5:1. So, this is  already a standard valu e. So, we are taking that is 1.5 :1. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 11:05)  
 
Now,  this come the definition sketch . So, this is typically we say as D or H that is  a 
depth of impounding , and this land slope  is 3 per  cent. Now, what we are doing here? 
That is, this is one of the  alterations that you can also assume the value and go forward 
and calculate . So, what we are doing here is that we are assuming that a depth of water h 
as 0.3 meters . 
So, this is our  assumpti on rest of calculating  the value  of what we are  doing . We are  
starting  with a n assumption , which always do es. So, we assume this as 0.3 , this slope we 
already know is  1.5 is to 1  so; that means, if this is 0.3 , this is H. This dista nce is 1.5 H or 
1.5 times or 0.3 . 
That is how we are getting  0.45 meters . And this is a 3 per  cent slope . So, this is 3 per  
cent this is  0.3, so obviously, if we calculate  this will come out to be  10 meters. So, that 
is why AD is 10 meters , and DC is 0.45 meter s. And then  again , this can be soil. So, again  that this is a  seepage line , and the slope is  
being taken as  5:1 because , say, a sandy soil. So,  all these  components or design 
parameters  are here in front of us , and then we have to on  the total height and the base 
width and the top width , and then we have to see that  it should be able to handle the 
discharge  for which it is being designed . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 12:56)  
 
So now , basically , the total area will be the area o f triangle ABC that is the area of ADB 
and the area of BDC . So, it is the sum of 2 triangles  that is total area is  an area sum of 
area ADC  plus area BDC .  
A = area of ADB + area of BDC  
Let area of ADB be a1; 
 a1 = 0.5 ×BD×AD 
Where BD = 0.30 m and AD = (100×0.3)/3 = 10 m  
Thus, a 1 = 0.5×0.3×10 = 1.5 m2 
(Refer  Slide Time: 14:24)   
Let the area of BDC be a 2,  
a2 = 0.5 ×BD×DC = 0.5×0.3×0.45 = 0.0675 m2 
Total ar ea = A = a 1 + a2 = 1.5 +0.0675 = 1.57 m2 (approx. ). 
So, this is the total area  which we have it should  that we  storage area. Basically , we are  
talking about . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 14:52)  
 
Now,  the next thi ng we have to calculate is the wetted perimeter . We saw that  it is 
nothing but the length that is in constant touch with water . In this case, it will be AB and 
BC. So, AB and BC , we can again the same  two triangles are there. So, we can  find out , P = AB +  BC = √(102+0.32) + √(0.32+0.452) = 10.54 m  
So, the hydraulic radius is , 
R = A/P = 1.57/10.54 = 0.15 m  
For flow velocity , we have to use  Manning’s formula , which is ; 
V = (1/n) R2/3 S1/2   
Where n value , we normally assume as 0.05 . So, that is what  is being assum ed, and this 
is 0.15 , and the grade of the channel is given 0.0018 . So,  
V = (1/0.05) 0.152/3 0.00181/2 = 0.3  m/s 
We are getting , and you remember , non-erosive velocity means, it should be  less than 0.5 
per cent and 0.65  in any case , so this is here this v elocity is  non-erosive . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 16:35)  
 
So that means, from knowing the  velocity and area , we can calculate Q which, is here . 
Q = A ×V = 1.57 ×0.30 = 0.47 m3/s 
 The channel capacity obtain ed 0.47 m3/s is greater than  the required. We require  only 
this much  (0.26 m3/s), and we are getting much greater . So, we may accept this or we may go and reduce the v alue of depth of ponding  h. So, that iteration process is there , but 
we are not doing  but because you can do that anywhere  and once h is calculate d. 
Then the  base width will be ; 
B = (ns + z) × h = (5 +1.5 ) × 0.3 = 1.95 m  
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:21)  
 
The total height of the  bund will be the depth of water plus the freeboard . Generally, we 
are ass uming 25 per  cent, but let us say we are assuming here is 15 centimetres . So, the 
total height comes out to be 0.45 m. 
So, that  top width will be ; 
T = B - 2×0.45×1.5 = 1.95  - 2×0.45×1.5 = 0.60 m.  
So, this way , the different dimensions  of the bund . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 17:56)   
We obtained are the height  is 0.45  meters , the base width is 1.95 meters , the top width is 
0.6 metres , and the side slope  is soil dependent , which we started with 1.5:1. So, this is 
how we have  designed a handled the  particular problem . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 18:14)  
 
Let us take the next pro blem , determine the dimensions of a graded bund which has to be 
constructed on land having a slope of 2 per  cent and vertical interval of 1 -meter  soil type 
is sandy. So, a  side slope of 2 :1 is recommended , and the slope of the seepage line is 5:1. 
So, thes e slopes are already given  the channel formed between the bunds is under 
vegetation  with Manning’s roughness coefficient value o f 0.04. And it has a bed slope of 0.25 per  cent. The graded bunds are to be constructed to drain a flow of  3.5 cubic  meter s 
per second. So, in this case , flow is already given . 
So, we have to determine the dimensions of the bund and also calculate the volume of 
earth work per hectare assume a free board of 15 centimetre s. So, almost all data is 
already given , including the flow in th is case . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 19:08)  
 
So, in this case , we can straight away try to use the height of the bund formula , which we 
saw we almost derived  using such paper .  
h = {(Q×n)3/8 × [√(1+z2) + √(1+(100/s)2)]1/4} / {(S/100)3/16×(50/s + z/2)5/8} 
So, is where h is a function of Q, n, z and 2 slopes S and s, remember  S is the channel 
bed slope  and s is the  land slope. So, all the values are given ; Q = 3.5 m3/s;  n = 0.04; z = 
2;  s = 2 %; S = 0.25 %. So, all the  unknown values are given .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 19:55)   
So putting these in the equation,  
h = {(3.5×0.04)3/8 × [√(1+22) + √(1+(100/2)2)]1/4} / {(0.25/100)3/16×(50/2 + 2/2)5/8} 
h = 0.62 m  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:11)  
 
And once h is know n, then; obviously, we have to get the total gross  height of the  bund  
the free board value is given is 15 centimetres . So, the gross height of the bund is  
calculated as height plus  15 centimetre s that is 77 centimetre s or 0.77 meters. That is the 
value of H we have obtained .  (Refer Slide Time: 20:34)  
 
  
And once h is known, the rest of the things are  simple ; we know  that bed width is   
B = (ns + z)×h = (5+2)×62 = 434 c m = 4.34  m 
Top width  is; 
T = B  - 2×z×H = 434 - 2×2×77 = 126 cm = 1.26 m  
So, because in this  problem , everything else was given we straightaway, calculated the 
value of h, and thus it was simpler to calculate  all other  values.  
 (Refer Slide Time: 21:18)   
So, in the second part of this , we have to calculate the earthwork . And earthwork per 
hectar e, we required horizontal interval , and we already know the relationship between 
horizontal interval  and vertical interval . The value of the vertical int erval is given. So, 
horizontal interval ; 
HI = (VI×100)/s  = (1×100)/2 = 50  m 
The l ength of  graded bund p er hectare  (L) = 10000/HI  = 10000/50 = 200 m  
The v olume of earth work per hectare = 0.5×(T+B)  ×H×L = 0.5 ×(1.26+ 4.34) ×0.77×200 
= 431 m3/ha 
So, that is  pretty straight forward ; it was simple because  values were all given to us . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 22:20)   
So, the final answers are dimensions of the bund height = 0.77 meters , base width  = 4.34 
meters, top width = 1.26 meters , side slope  = 2:1 and volume of earthwork per hectare 
431 m3. So, this is what  the answer will be . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 22:41)  
 
Take the third problem  in a given area having a land slope of 2 per  cent graded bunds 
have t o be constructed with a channel between  them to drain a discharge of 0.005 cubic 
meter s per second . 
The bund should have a side slope of 2 :1; according to the recommendation , the run off 
depth of the field was calculated using the NRCS curve number technique . Consi dering the AMC 2 condition , and curve number for the area was reported to be 75 . This runoff 
depth was considered to be the depth of ponding behind the bund . Using the above data , 
what channel slope  can be recommended  between the  bunds . Use n equals 0.04 and 6-
hour rainfall 2 5-year frequency rainfall is 120 millimetres.  
So, in this case , we have been a lot of data is given , but the important thing is that we 
have to ca lculate the runoff volume in depth using the NRCS curve number technique. 
So, that is important . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 23:42)  
 
And if you remember , the NRCS curve number method was used for calculating  the 
volume of runoff in depth units . And this is how th e curve number looks  formula looks 
like: 
VQ = (P – 0.2S)2/(P+0.8S)  
Where, P = precipitatio n, and S = potential moisture r etention  
S is related to curve number by this formula ;  
S = (25400/CN) - 254 
This is  when  S is in millimetres , and this particular form ula is used . And because curve number is given , by p utting curve number here , we can get the 
maximum potential retention  S value ; 
S = (25400/75) -254 = 84.67  mm 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:36)  
 
That is , precipitation is given as 120 millimetres or 12 centimetre s. And the value of S 
we have  calculated is 8.467 centimetres. We are converting into centimetre s because the 
value of P and S required in the  curve number method is in centimetre s. 
VQ = (12 – 0.2×8.467 )2/(12+0.8×8.467 ) = 5.66 cm  
So, depth of  ponding  in previous cases , we calculated , in this case,  calculating VQ, we 
directly get the depth of  ponding. So,  this is another variation of the problem which we 
might  face. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 25:19)   
And once  we have obtained this , we can  substitute  all the values because Q is known ; n 
is known ; z is known ; s is known , and h is known . We can substitute in this . So, only 
unknown is  S or channel bed slope . So, by putting all the values in this equation   
h = {(Q×n)3/8 × [√(1+z2) + √(1+(100/s)2)]1/4} / {(S/100)3/16×(50/s + z/2)5/8} 
0.0566 = {(0.005 ×0.04)3/8 × [√(1+22) + √(1+(100/2)2)]1/4} / {(S/100)3/16×(50/2 + 
2/2)5/8} 
(Refer Slide Time: 25:41)  
 
.   
 
On simpl ification , we get S or the channel  slope ; 
(S/100)3/16 = 0.2543  
S = 0.0674 %  
The recommended channel  slope is 0.0 674 per  cent. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 25:58)  
 
So now we go to the last problem  design a 300 metre  long graded bund for a cultivated 
land with sandy soil sandy loam soil  surface slope of 4 per  cent bund channel is to be  
formed by embankment only . The horizonta l distance between 2 bunds is 50 meters  the 
maximum depth of rainfall in the catchment with a 10 year return period is  given below. 
So, the duration versus depth of rainfall relationship is given here . 
 (Refer Slide Time:  26:31)   
So, data available are the length of bund 350 meters , the land slope is 4 per  cent, soil 
sandy loam , HI is 50 meters , and rainfall data is given  so; obviously, here again , we have 
to determine the peak rate of runoff using the rational method  in the previous case w hich 
we handle r ational method . They are we had been given rainfall for the time of 
concentration for a duration equal to the time of concentration , but this is not the case . 
So, here  we have to calculate the time  of concentration Tc using  Kirpich formula ,  
Tc = 0.019 5 L0.77 S-0.385 
The total length  which the flow has to flow , which we consider is  horizontal interval plus  
length l, which is the length of the bund itself , the perpendicular distance we always  talk 
about . 
So, because if we consider here  in 3 dimension s if you  see here so; that means, any drop 
which occurs first it has to flow here that is horizontal interval  and then the length. So, 
that is the maximum length which comes out to be  400 meters in this case. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 27:55)   
And total elevation drop w ill be  plot width is 4 per  cent slope  over 50 meter s 
((4/100 )×50) is 2 meters . The total length of the bund is 350 meters. So, what we are 
doing as a variation , we can say that  we are breaking that into four diffe rent parts 75  
meter s, 75 meter s, 100 meter s and 100 meter s. And we are saying that the  variable slope  
is provided. So, the  lower 75 is 0.14 per  cent, the second 75  is 0.13  drop, 100 meter s is 
upper one  has 0.1 per  cent. So,  for each , we can calculate the slope value  becaus e length 
is known , slope p er cent is known. So, slope length we can find out .  
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:41)  
 
And thus the over the channel , the total drop  comes out to be 0.4225 meters , and the total 
drop comes out to be ; Total dr op H = 2+0.4225 = 2.4225 m  
That means  the total slope  will be ; 
S = H/L  = 2.4225/ 400 = 0.006  
So, in  the formula , now we know L , we know S . So, by putting this formula  
Tc = 0.019 5 (400)0.77 (0.006 )-0.385 = 14.07 min 
And then, we have to use this to obtain  the data from the  table itself . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29: 18) 
 
So, if you look at the table , the value is given for 10 and 20. We have to obtain for 14 , 
so; obviously, we can  always interpolate in between these 2 . So, interpolating , we get as 
25+((55-25)×(4/10)) = 37 mm. 
The rainfall intensity for 14 minutes , that is, rainfall in 14 minutes  is 37 mm. So, the 
intensity will be :: (37/14)×60 = 158.6 mm/h  or roughly say 16 cm/h . (Refer Slide Time: 29:59)  
 
So, once T c is known , the intensity is known , and we know the  C, we know the total area 
because  HI and L are kno wn. So, the area is known . So, we can put in the rational 
formula  
Area = 50 ×350 = 175000m2 = 1.7 5 ha 
QP = (0.3 ×16×1.75)/36 = 0.23 m3/s 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:23)  
 So, that means  we have to handle this discharge . And then the rest of the things, side  
slope  for sandy loam is  known 1.5 :1, for seepage line  in sandy loam is 5 :1. We assume a 
depth  of 25 centimetres , and like previously, we have solved this problem  we can go  
ahead and get the  cross -section , etcetera . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:45)  
 
So, here the sum of 2 areas  will find out which comes out to be 0.83. If I am calculate the 
wetted perimete r and once  we have done  that, 
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:57)  
 We calculate  the hydraulic radius , which comes out to be 0.1234 meters  and once the 
hydraulic radius is kno wn. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 31:08)  
 
Then, we can use the values in Manning’s equation to calcu late the velocity of flow  
V = (1/0.04 )×0.12342/3×0.0061/2 = 0.23 m/s which is non-erosive . 
The discharge capacity , Q = AV = 0.83 ×0.29 = 0.19 m3/s 
The problem is that  the channel  capacity we are calculating is 0.19 m3/s, but the 
discharge we have to handle is 0. 23 m3/s; that means  the channel does not have sufficient 
capacity to carry QP. So, we need to increase d and recalculate the dimension , so this is 
that variatio n because  this calculated value is not sufficie nt to  handle the  desired  
discharge . 
. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 31:54)   
So, obviously, then it is just a iteration.  So, we will go and change the value, calculate A 
calculate P, then calculate the hydraulic radius , which new value comes out  to be  0. 147.  
(Refer S lide Time: 32:03)  
 
And then, we have to now calculate once again the velocity , which is 0.54  fine, still fine . 
And then QP value we have to calculate , which comes out to be 0.64 m3/s, which is 
sufficient b ecause the discharge we have to handle was 0.23. So, the channel now has 
sufficient capacity to carry  QP under non -erosive limits , so; that means  we have handled 
the problem . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 32:27)   
So, the bund dimensions  the discharge is handled . So, the bund dimensions can be 
calculated the base width of the bund we know  how to calculate , the height of the bund 
we know  how to calculate , the top width of bund we know  how to calculate. So, once  H 
is known , everything  else can be calculated easily . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 32:48)  
 
So, thus, in thi s case , the final answers are  the height of bund  0.45 m , base width 195  m, 
top width 0.6 , side slope 1.5 :1, the discharge capacity is  0.64 m3/s which is slightly 
higher , but we accept that . So, with this , we hav e handled  four different kinds of p roblems , and where I mean , 
ultimately , we have to have flow with us and  once flow there  that, for estimating that 
flow. We might have to use the rational method. We might have to find out the time of 
concentration  if requ ired and also which is possible to use the S CS curve number 
technique. So, all these will be used for  finding out the flow . Once flow you know  then, 
we can either assume the value of d or go and calculate the value of d and then other 
dimensions. So, if yo u practice a few more problems like thi s and we will be giving 
putting some problems into the assignment , I think things will be very clear to you.  
Thank you very much .
