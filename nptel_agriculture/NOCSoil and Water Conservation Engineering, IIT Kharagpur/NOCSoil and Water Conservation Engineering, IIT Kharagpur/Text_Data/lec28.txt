Basics of Ope n Channel Hydraulics ‚Äì 1 
 
Hello , friends welcome back to NPTEL  online certification course on Soil and Water 
Conservation Engineering . 
I am Rajendra Singh Professor in Agriculture and Food Engineering  Department of IIT 
Kharagpur . We are in week 6 lecture 29 and the topic today is Basics of Open Channel 
Hydraulics par t I. To have a rule relook at the course content of this week , we started this 
week with lecture 26 introducing the gully control measures . 
We continued in lecture 27 with gully control measures and  with a special focus on 
permanent structures . And then lecture 28 was on design  considerations for permanent 
gully  control structures and this lecture will be basics of open channel hydraulics part I 
and the basics of open channel hydraulics will continue in lectures lecture 30 that will be 
the next le cture and it will be part 2. 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:16 ) 
 
Now, coming to open channels  it is an open channel in a conduit  where liquid flows with 
a free surface  and free surface is in contact with at atmosphere . So, we know that every 
time we draw that we d raw a trapezoidal channel and then we make a water surface  and 
then we put the dimensions . So, that simply means it  is a liquid that flows with a free 
surface and the pressure on the liquid surface is atmospheric . 
And the different examples of open channel s could be rivers , they are the greatest examples 
then streams , irrigation canals , storm drains , the street gutters  and sewers  that are flowing 
partially full  for example, this one  this is also example of open channel . 
And open channels  could have differen t cross -sectional shapes for example, we have 
already seen  trapezoidal , triangular , rectangular and also as we have seen that it could be 
circular conduit  flowing parsley full that could be an example of sewers . So, this could 
also be a particular shape . So, these are various possible shapes of open channel  open 
channels . 
(Refer Slide Time: 02:42 ) 
 
Then coming to the flow classification based on fluid particle motion  flow is basically 
classified into two categories ; laminar flow  and turbulent flow . So, basically , say fluid 
magical motion , we know that if it is laminar flow and the  flow there  will follow 
streamlines and where is in turbulent motion streamlines will not be followed . 
(Refer Slide Time: 03:12 ) 
 
 And typically this classification  is based on  Reynolds number  that is designated  by R 
suffix e and given by rho v d by mu or v d by mu . So, this is the  formula that we used for 
finding out Reynolds number . 
And for open channel flow , the especially  the flow to be laminar Reynolds number  should 
be less than 500 and for turbulent flow , Reynolds number will be greater than 500. I  am 
sure that you must have read in hydraulics pipe flow and in pipe flow laminar flow  limit 
was reminiscent my limit was 2000, but in open general flow , it is 500. 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:00 ) 
 
 Then flow could also be classified with respect to space  and if you do  so, flow could be 
uniform flow  or nonuniform flow , and when  if it is a uniform flow then the depth of flow 
remains constant along the channel . So, flow with  a constant discharge in a channel of 
constant geometrical shape and slope is an example of  uniform flow . 
So, if you have a  channel and if this is the channel bed  and if the flow is taking place . So, 
uniform flow means , the depth here  and if here we measur e a depth then , if this is y  1 and 
this is y 2 then y 1 will be equal to  y 2. So that means, with respect to space the depth of 
flow will remain constant ly provided  discharges constant channels  shape and slope is 
constant . So, if channel slope is  constant and flow is constant , then it will produce uniform 
death throughout the length of the  channel . 
 On the other hand , if it is a nonuniform flow , then depth of flow changes along the 
channel . So, if it is a nonuniform flow  even with a constant discharge  in a channel of 
varying geometrically shape or slope  so, something has to happen  for flow to become 
nonuniform . 
So, that could be by a change in slope of the channel or by putting some kind of a structure 
in the channel flow could get converted into nonuniform flow. But basically , if with respect 
to space the depth of flow remains constant in a channel that is referred to as uniform flow . 
And if the depth changes then it is it for this nonuniform flow . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:00 ) 
  
Similarly , flow can also be classified  with respect to time . So, with respect to time , the 
flow is an effort to edge or classified  as a steady flow and unsteady flow . So, a steady flow 
means the depth of flow does not change with time at a location in the channel . So, if we , 
if we in  this case if we draw a channel and if flow is taking place in this  so, this is your 
channel bed  and this is the water surface . So, if you consider a particular location and if 
measure the depth of water . So, over a period of time , there will be no change in the depth 
of flow  so, with respect to time at a particular location the depth of load does not change . 
So, that is a steady flow where is a depth of flow changes with time at a location , then it is 
refer red to as unsteady inflow . If it is a  flow of this  kind of or a particular place after some 
time if flow is having a different  depth , then it is referred to it unsteady flow . So, with 
respect to time it is steady flow or unsteady flow with respect to space it was a  uniform 
flow, non inform flow with parti cle motion to us laminar flow or turbulent flow  so, 
different possible classifications of flow as possible . 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:22 ) 
 
So, continuing with the flow classification  so, if we combine these terms which we have 
just seen the flow could be a steady uniform flow  that is there is a constant depth  in time  
and distance . So, if you have to take a flow case where the flow depth does not change 
with the space and if you take a particular location it does not change with time , then it is 
refer red to as it steady uniform flow . 
On the other hand , we have other classification is steady nonuniform ; flow we are depth 
varies with distance , but not time . So, if you consider here  so, if there  is some kind of a n 
obstruction  in the flow , because of that the depth will change with space , but if you take a 
particular section and if you measure the flow with time the flow remaining constant the 
depth will remain constant . 
So, that kind of flow is referred to as steady nonuniform . So, with ti me it is steady , but it 
faces is changing  so, it is very right it is nonuniform . Then there is a nother case of unsteady 
flow where depth varies with both time  and distance . So, if the flow varies both with time 
and distance then it is referred to as it uns teady flow . And there is a vertical possibility of 
unsteady uniform flow , but typically this was  not possible that with time flow changes , but 
with distance it does  not change that is very rare  so, it is typically we only talk about 
unsteady flow . 
(Refer S lide Time: 09:02 ) 
 
Then, we can come to another kind of classification that is nonuniform flow within 
nonuniform flow , flow could be further classified as gradually varied flow  or rapidly 
varied flow . So, when the velocity and depth of flow  change over a long distance in a 
channel then , it is referred to as not gradually varied flow , where any velocity and depth 
of flow change over a short distance then it is referred to as it is rapidly varied flow .  
(Refer Slide Time: 09:31 ) 
 
And the different types of flow may occur in the same channel . So, if it is same channel , 
which is subject to different kind s of conditions , then the flow may change from one place 
to the other and the type of flow may be different . For example, if it is a sluice gate  so, 
immediately after sluice gate , there will be case of rapidly varied flow . 
That is a flow depth will change rapidly  over a short distance of and after that  it might take 
a form of uniform flow . And then if there is  some obstruction V R is placed , then sudde nly 
the flow because of hydraulic jump phenomena the rapidly varied flow will occur and then 
for some distance there might be uniform flow , when there is some sudden fall then rapidly 
varied flow . 
Then after that then there is nothing happening much then c ould be a gradually varied 
flow, then further if slope changes daily and it will be rapidly very flow ing and finally, it 
could further finally, uniform flow . So, depending upon the conditions within the channel 
whether the slope is changing or depth is cha nging or some structures  output  in the same 
channel over a certain length  different types of flow could be seen . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:43 ) 
 
So, a steady uniform flow in channel if you consider in open channels , then basically  we 
know that ; the steady uniform flow that is the depth of flow does not change with time or 
with the space that  is the uniform flow . So, in this case , streamlines are  straight and 
parallel ; that means, streamlines will be followed , hydrostatic pressure distribution wi ll be 
uniform  that is here the uniform  hydrostatic pressure we will there and velocity head will 
be constant . 
So, this is velocity head ùëâ2
2ùëî, that will remain constant through out the channel. So, channel 
bottom which is here , the water surface  that is this line water surface which is also referred 
to as Hydraulic Grade Line or HGL  and Energy Grade Line that is EGL  these are all 
parallel . 
So, here these are three parallel lines are there and if flow is steady uniform , then continuity 
equation and  manning equations are applied . And we have already had a lot of example s 
solved  dealing with the steady uniform flow  but, whatever cases we discussed  under 
vegetative waterways there were all considered as  cases of steady uniform flow . So, in the 
open cha nnel so, that we have  already a  lot of experience with .  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:06 ) 
 
Then, we come to the next that is steady nonuniform flow  in open channels  and if you look 
at the energy relations for steady nonuniform flow . And if this is a channel and if you 
consider two sections  delta x distance  apart that is this is section 1 and this is section 2, 
which are delta x difference apart in a channel . 
ùëù1
ÔÅß+ùõº1ùëâ12
2ùëî+ùëß1=ùëù2
ÔÅß+ùõº2ùëâ22
2ùëî+ùëß2+‚Ñéùêø 
Then, the one -dimensional energy equation may be written as  that is at section  1 the sum 
of the energy that is pressure , velocity and elevation that the sum of pressure head , the 
velocity head , and the elevation head  at section 1  equal to  the sum  of the pressure head , 
the velocity head , and the elevation head  at section 2 plus the h L that is head loss due to 
friction . So, this is  the form of a one-dimensional energy equation  for non-uniform steady 
flow.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:09 ) 
 
Now, from the figure , we can see that  ùëù1
ÔÅß+ùëß1=ùë¶1+ ùëÜ0ÔÅÑùë•, that is at section  1 if you 
consider this section 2, we see  that ùëù2
ÔÅß+ùëß2=ùë¶2. ùë¶1,ùë¶2 are depth of flow . And this is the 
elevation change because of the bed slope  (S0) which we have seen in previous figures . 
So, S 0 is be d slope and they tell the distance between two sections it delta x  so, this 
elevation is  from the datum it is  ùëÜ0ÔÅÑùë•. 
If you consider the energy coefficients alpha  1 and alpha  2 is equal to  1, then equation  1 
the previous equation we are simply replacing the pressure head and elevation heads  
summation by these considerations in terms of depth  and slope .  
So,  
ùë¶1+ùëâ12
2ùëî+ùëÜ0ÔÅÑùë•=ùë¶2+ùëâ22
2ùëî+‚Ñéùêø 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:51 ) 
 
So, this has come in place of this  and this and this has come  in place of this from equation 
number  1. So, if we consider a special case, where channel bottom is horizontal , that is  S0 
= 0; and head loss is  0, h L = 0. T hen equation  2 becomes (y1 + ùëâ12
2ùëî). we remember we had  
ùëÜ0ÔÅÑùë• = 0, so, that term is gone . And we are assuming  ‚Ñéùêø= 0, 
So,  
ùë¶1+ùëâ12
2ùëî=ùë¶2+ùëâ22
2ùëî 
 
 Now, at the same time , the sum of the depth of flow  and velocity head is defined as 
specific energy , that is :  
E = y + ùëâ2
2ùëî 
And this question says the specific energy of section 1 is the same as question specific 
energy of section 2; that means, equation three states that  specific  energy at section 1 is 
equal to specific energy at section 2.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:56 ) 
  
 And the  from continuity equation we know  ùê¥1ùëâ1=ùê¥2ùëâ2 = Q. So, we can also write that 
equation that is we can replace  V by ùëÑ
ùê¥. So, we can write this equation as : 
ùë¶1+ùëÑ2
2ùëîùê¥12=ùë¶2+ùëÑ2
2ùëîùê¥22 
 And A depends on y  because  A has y be it any kind of cross -section  so, specific energy  is 
solely  a function of depth  at each section . So, it is a function of depth only because  ‚ÄòA‚Äô is 
also a function of depth and depth is already there .  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:35 ) 
 
So, we can make a  specific energy plot . So, for a given channel  and given  Q is the depth 
of flow is plotted against  E, then we get a specific  energy curve . So, y is plotted against  E 
and the curve we get is referred to as a specific energy curve . Now you can see that this 
line dotted  line represents is 1 is to 1 slope line . 
So, you just notice that there is a typical shape of this specific energy curve and specific 
location also and  that is because it 1 is to 1 line E is equal to y . So, everywhere , if you see  
E is equal to y  so, beat here anywhere . And since  E is greater than y , because it has a 
velocity head also  so, E is y equals to V square by 2 g. 
 So, due to velocity head is always be greater than y , which  simply means that a specific 
can converge curve  will always be  below 1 is to 1 line, because on x -axis E will always be 
greater than y . So, that is why it will always lie below this 1 is to 1 line, this is a very 
important  point you should always remember because you should never make a mistake 
of trying you r specific energy curve if somebody asks you to draw over this 1 is to 1 line. 
So, this is  one important fact about this specific energy curve .  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:05 ) 
 
Now, we see here from this curve that is for given specific energy if you just draw  a vertical 
line here . This vertical line if you consider then , for a given specific energy depth could 
be either large that is there are  two depths possible this is y1 and this is y2 two depths are 
possible for the same energy . And for y 1 when the depth of flow is more , the potential 
energy is high  and for y 2 with the depth is less kinetic energy is high .  
 And th is y1 and y2 were  due to depths where the specific energy is the same they are 
referred to as  alternate depths . So, y1 and y 2 here where the  specific energy is the same 
then, they are referred to in alternate depth . So, it can be seen that on  a specific energy 
curve , a point 4 that is this point is reached where the is specific energy is minimum  only 
a single depth occurs . 
So, at this point  specific energy is minimum , as you can see here  just a single depth , of 
course,  that is y c  and this depth is referred to as critical depth . So, because  of a typical 
shape , there  is a point i n which were , just energy in minimum there is only  one depth  of 
possible and that depth is referred to as critical depth . 
(Refer Slide Time: 19:30 ) 
 
And at this point , that is where this critical depth occurs flow is termed as  critical . So, this 
point flow is critical flow and critical flow is the flow that occurs  when the specific energy 
is minimum  for a given discharge . 
So, that is a typical definition that critical flow is the flow that occurs when the specific 
energy is minimum for a given discharge  so, this is the definition of critical flow . And this 
is very important  in the floral regime because a lot of developments  are different on this 
critical flow identification and will see this  in later parts of the lecture . 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:17 ) 
 
And the flow which the depth is less than critical , that is velocity is greater than critical , it 
is termed as supercritical  so, this is depth critical depth and below this , the depth will be 
less than critical depth . And that means, velocit y will be greater than velocity critical 
velocity and that is why the flow is , therefore, a supercritical flow . 
On the other hand , the flow for which the depth is more than critical that is any point above 
here then, where velocity is less than critical  that it returned is subcritical flow . So, that is 
why it is identified identification of critical flow helps in identifying the flow regime  or 
the dividing flow regime into three distinct phases  that is critical flow , subcritical flow , 
and supercritical fl ow.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:08 ) 
  
And if we see the characteristics of critical flow  that critical flow occurs when the specific 
energy is minimum  we know that  so, for a given  Q we know that , 
ùê∏=ùë¶+ùëÑ2
2ùëîùê¥2 
So, if we solve for ùëëùê∏
ùëëùë¶=0, 
then we can determine the depth for this condition that is for critical flow condition s. So, 
if we do that d E by d y  so, this is  1 and of course,  we have already said that A is a function 
of y. So, that is why will also differentiat e which is A so, if we do that we get  equation 8, 
i.e.,  
ùëëùê∏
ùëëùë¶=1‚àíùëÑ2
ùëîùê¥3 ùëëùê¥
ùëëùë¶ 
 
So, if the  T is the width of the channel at the water surface , then d A = T d y that is  obvious 
and putting this in equation 8 and setting ùëëùê∏
ùëëùë¶= 0 for critical condition . If we do that  we 
will get , 
ùëÑ2ùëáùëê
ùëîùê¥3=1 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:28 ) 
 
 So, this is the condition which we get  ùëÑ2ùëáùëê
ùëîùê¥ùëê3=1 and this equation cell can be written  in 
several other forms ; like for example,  
ùê¥ùëê
ùëáùëê=ùëÑ2
ùëîùê¥ùëê2 
ùê¥ùëê
ùëáùëê=ùëâ2
ùëî 
 So, if the channel is a rectangular cross -section , then Ac by Tc is equal to critical depth y 
c which is quite obvious because , because  we know that for  a rectangular section  so, it will 
be this is B equal to  T and this is y . 
So, A area by area equal to B y or T y so, it so; that means, A by T equal to  y so, that is 
well so, Ac is equal to critical depth . So, if we also define  q small  q is discharge d per unit 
width of the channel or capital  Q by B for rectangular channel B equal to  Tc. Then we can 
write:  
ùë¶ùëê= ùëû2
ùëîùë¶ùëê2 or ùë¶ùëê=(ùëû2
ùëî)1/3 
So, critical depth for  a rectangular  channel can be found out provided we know the 
discharge per unit width and ; obviously, gravitational  ah; acceleration due to gravity g will 
be known to us . 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:48 ) 
 
Further , if you apply equation 11 to a rectangular channel , then we also can write  
ùë¶ùëê=ùëâùëê2
ùëî=ùëâùëê2
ùëîùë¶ùëê=1  
or if you take square root of that . So, we can write that  
ùëâùëê
‚àöùëîùë¶ùëê = 1 
and this term that is left hand side of equation 13 is referred to as Froude number F, which 
is the ratio of stream velocity inertia force  to wave velocity gravity force . 
So, this is a critical flow condition , so, at critical flow  Froude number is 1 and for  
subcritical flow , when velocity will be less than V c Froude number will be less than 1 for 
supercritical flow when velocity will be greater than V c, then it will be greater than 1. So, 
this is important finding  and Froude number is  used to classify or identify the flow re gimes . 
That is whether  the flow is critical , super critical or subcritical that is specific energy  which 
responds to a specific energy also we have already seen this .  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:59 ) 
 
 And there are  many practical applications of this specific energy  constant . So, we already 
have seen that Froude number helps in attending type of flow  of flow regime . And critical 
flow concept is useful in measurement of flow in the open channels  large number of flumes  
and broad crested weirs  are based on critical flow concept . That is if you consider the 
broadcaster weir,  we typically we provided hump  in the channel bed and because of that 
what happens the flow will becomes for sub critical , because depth will larger depth will 
be there . 
 And then on the o ther side it  is a freefall  so, from subcritical to supercritical it goes and 
because of that there will be some critical flow depth formation on the channel on the on 
the hump itself . And that facilitates measurement of or the discharge measurement by just  
a single measurement on upstream side that  is the concept on which the broadcasted weirs  
work which works on the function of specific energy  concept .  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:02 ) 
 
 Similarly , in the critical flow  typically occurs where whenever there is a slope changes in 
a channel . So, whatever slope changes the flow changes from subcritical to supercritical 
and or otherwise  so, because of that there will be critical flow or with there is a free a over 
fall at the end of channel . So, if long channel is the re suddenly there is a free or fall , then 
the, at the end of the channel there will be  critical flow . 
It is critical flow concept is useful in handling smooth channel transition problems  so, how 
to if it is there is change in slope or change in bed width , then how the slope will change 
and how transition should take place ? That is found out through use using this huge critical 
flow concept  and also by compute the water surface for advice . So, channel transition 
already we have seen could be due to gradual c hange in channel  bottom or in channel 
width  both cases there will be  channel transition .  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:02 ) 
 
 So, if you look at example number 1, then it says determine the critical depth  in a 
trapezoidal channel  for a discharge of  14 cumec  that width of the channel bottom is 6 meter 
and the side slope upward at an angle of 45 degrees . So, we have been given data given 
our Q equals to 14 cumec , B equals to 6 meters and z is 1, because 45 degree is nothing , 
but 1  is to 1 slope .  
So, this is the condition we have already seen  that is  
  
(ùëÑ2ùë¶ùëê)
ùëîùê¥ùëê3=1 
ùê¥ùëê3
ùëáùëê=ùëÑ2
ùëî = 142
9.81=19.98 
So, Q  is known g is known  so, that value comes out to be 19.98.  And for a trapezoidal 
channel we know that if we are talking about critical condition because , this is a critical 
condition we are talking about . So, if depth you consider that depth is critical  so, area is 
critical . So, the critical area is  
ùê¥ùëê = Bùë¶ùëê+ùëßùë¶ùëê2=6ùë¶ùëê+ ùë¶ùëê2 
B is given is 6 and z is given as 1 
So,  
ùëáùëê = B + 2z ùë¶ùëê=6+2ùë¶ùëê 
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:24 ) 
 
So, if we put the values  in the previous found relationship . So,  
(6ùë¶ùëê+ùë¶ùëê2)3
6+2ùë¶ùëê=19.98 
 that means, it is only a function this equation in function of y c . So, by trial and error we 
can find out  and will find the value o f yc which comes out to be 0.78 meters . So, the critical 
depth for the given condition in this channel is 0.78 meters .  
(Refer Slide Time: 29:02 ) 
 
 So, we take another example , a rectangular channel  lined with planed wood  n equals to 
0.012 has a width of 8.2 meters . When the depth of water is 1 meter , the flow is 10.5 
cumec . Determine the required slope ; the specific energy and the type of flow these things 
we have to find out .  
So, data given our rectangular given B is equal to 8.2 meters rectangular channel of course,  
y is given as 1 meter that is depth of water , Q is given as 10.5 cumec and for wood , planed , 
the value of mannings roughness coefficient n is given at 0.012. L et us say that channel 
bed slope is S so, cross sectional area of the channel is b times y and b is known , y is 
known  so, it is 8.2 square meters . Wetted perimeter B plus 2 y B is known , y is known , so, 
it is 10.2 meters , hydraulic radius is ratios at  A by P so, A  by P 8 by 2 by 10 by 2 is 0.8 
meters . 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:15 ) 
 
So, from continuity equation  V = Q/A, so, Q is known , A is known  so, V comes out to be 
1.28 meters per second . And manning equation we know  V = (1/ n)R2/3S1/2, V is known , n 
is known , R we have already calculated . So, only unknown  S so, from here we can find 
which comes out to be  S = 1:3148  where  so, that is the bed slope of the channel , that is 
there will be 1 meter fall over 3148  meters horizontal . 
Now, a specific energy can be calculated using the base equation that is  
Y = E = y + V2/2g. So, y is known here , V is known here , g is known here by putting the 
values we get  a specific energy value is  1.08 meters . And then third thing we have to find 
out the Froude number , the equation we already know Froude number is   
ùêπ= ùëâ
‚àöùëîùë¶ 
and so, V is known here , y is known here , g is known here . 
So, if you put the values we get  a value of  Froude number it  is 0.41 and you if you 
remember ; that if Froude number is less than  1, then the flow is subcritical  that we just 
saw we saw that for critic al flow F is equal to  1 and for subcritical is less than  1 for 
supercritical is greater than 1. 
So, since it is here 0.41 so, flow is subcritical . So, the three answers we have that slope is  
1 is to 3148, energy is specific energy  1.08 meters and drop Froude number is 0.41 and 
flow is subcritical . So, with this we have seen some of the fundamentals of  a weapon 
channel already leaks  in a in specific energy concept , what could be is possible application 
and will continue with the further with the further fundamentals of open channel hydraulics 
in the next lecture when we come is . 
Thank you very much .
