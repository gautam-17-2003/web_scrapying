Size R eduction (Contd.)  
 
Hello, everyone ; welcome to the NPTEL  online certification  course on Fundamentals of 
Food Process E ngineering . We will continue today with size reduction and we are at the 
last stage of this particular chapter . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:38)  
 
We have started discussing on different  equipment s which are  being used for size 
reduction operation in industry and also in the  small scale or large scale work . So, in that 
we have  discuss ed the crushers , grinders and ultr afine  grinders and cutting and slicing 
machines , all the se will discuss today  also, we will discuss the  homo genizer s which are  
used for t he liquid food s, size reduction of the liquid food s. (Refer Slide Time: 01:08)  
 
So, first is , in the last class we have  discuss ed up to the ball mill and today we will 
discuss the attrition mill or that is also called the plat e mill or burr mill . 
So, this looks like  this the , the figure s are  like this . It may be horizontal  maybe vertical , 
surface s is maybe flat or conical or  vertical and horizon tal, that consists of two 
roughe ned plates , one is stationary and the other is rota ting with a speed of 350 to 700 
rpm. for example  if you look into this  vertical attrition mill , the inner one is rotating and 
the outer one is fix , but they have a  corrugated serfaces  throughout  for better effect on 
the siz e reduction . 
So, in double runner  attrition mill  both disk are rotated . So, the second option  is also 
available  that means, initially we have mentioned that they maybe one is stationary and 
one is rotating that the picture  here depicts that one, but there are double runner disk also  
where both the disk s are rotated at 1200  to 7000  rpm in opposite direction . 
 Size deduction by crushing and shear  and the fineness of grinding is  controlled  by type 
and plates and also the adjusting gap between  these two plates . 
So, what happen that when we give the feed between these two based on the  type and 
patte rn or size of the feed material . We can adjust the gap between these two plates . And 
also we can control the type of the plate for  controlling the fineness of the grinding . (Refer Slide Time: 03:21) . 
 
 So, the capacity of this  attrition mill generally varies from  0.5 to 8 ton/hour. So, we can 
see very small to very  large scale  that means, home scale to  large industrial scale  
production can be done . And the particle  that we produced that generally  have less than 
200 mesh size . The power  require ment is  8 to 80 kWh/ton . 
So, here we can see that every arrangement  is a different kin d in this particular tha t has 
been given here . The fix grinding  plate is this one  and the rotating grinding  is this one 
which is attached to a shaft . The gap of this too can be adjusted  and there is a machine  
casing . So, product will be discharged from the bottom section  and the feed is coming 
from the top . So, feed is coming from here then from , it is going through this  top section . 
And then there is thread screw which is  taking forward  the feed to the gap between these 
two plates . There  is a corrugated plate s in between these the product is there and because 
of the rotation rotational  motion , the attrition mill works . 
Now, the advantages that , this is lower  in initial cost . If you want to  set up a attrition  
mill, we can do it with very low cost and power requirement is also  less. we are getting 
the uniform product size , so, that is an advantage . However, there are certain limitations  
as well  that the foreign material  if they may come with the product , they can damage the 
disk surface. Operations without the feed result in the bar wear . because of this issues  we 
need to be careful that the only the pure product or the grain  that we want to handle 
should come in between the two plates . (Refer Slide Time: 05:43)  
 
Now agitator mill , so, agitator mill , the grinding medium is suspended in a vertical vessel  
of 4 to 1200  litre in capacity which is filled with liquid . 
Grinding medium here are  balls pellets  or sand grains . Concentrated  feed slurry is 
admitted from the top  and the product with some liquid is discharge d through the screen 
at the bottom . Product size varies  from 1 μm or finer . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:16 ). 
 Cutting  and shopping are again size reduction operations  based on shearing  through the 
use of sharp edges moving elements like knives  or blades . The term cutting is usually 
reserve d for operation resulting in particle with  fairly regular geometry forms like cubes  
and slices . So, rotary knife cutter is an example which we use for cutting the veg etables 
and all . 
Chopping  is a random cutting , so, sizing will not be uniform in that case . Here  is a cube 
cutter  which  has a specific serrated  geome try for the cutting blade . So, it will cut at a 
particular shape of a cubic  shape  of all the products and that we can see here . And the in 
case of chopping  we just put the abrupt  force on the materials  so, that the irregular shape 
particle may c ome out . 
 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:23) . 
 
Rotary knife cutter , there is  a rotar y knife cutter which is the knives  are attach with all 
the 5 different cones of the rotor . These  knives  are fixed with the  screw , fix with  the 
arrangement . And there is a screen also  so, when the particle will be reduced in the size 
because of action of these blades they will come down and discharge from the bottom . 
So, how they work ? There is a horizontal rotor  in cylindrical chamber  and which rotates 200 to 900 rpm speed . 2 to 12 flying knife with sharp edge are passing with  a clearance 
over 1 to 7 stationary knives . So, here the  stationary knives are there . 
So, stationary knives and flying knives are coming in between these two contact  point . 
So, then the shearing  happens and the particle will break . 
 So, feed reduces several 100 times because of this  arrangement . Bottom screen  opening 
is 5 to 8 mm. so, when the particle  size comes lower than that , it will  come down from 
that sieve . Knives at an angle or parallel to the stationary sieve , so, these knives  which 
are coming down  every time . So, there is a two stationary knives here  and all the flying 
knives  are attach with the rotor . So, these are  comi ng with an angle or with just parallel 
to the stationary knives . So, the clearance between  the stationary knives  and the flying 
knives  should be very less , so, that the cutting action will be done . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:18)  
 
Now, coming to the size reduction of liquid food s. So, as we have seen that  for the , for 
the solid material there are very different  applications , very different kind of equipments 
are available which work on the compression , shear , impact , cutting force  etc. Now, if 
we look into the liquid product  so, there also in some application , we need to  make the 
smaller particle . For example,  the, the most common is the  milk when we want to  
homogenise  the milk we want to make the uniform  distribution of fat in the milk . So, we 
try to  reduce the fat particles , fat globule into the small  size and distribution will be 
uniform because of that . So, that kind of operation we will see now .  In that  generally  we do Emulsification and H omogenisation . So, Emulsificat ion is the 
formation of a stable emulsion by the intimate mixing of two or more immiscible liquid . 
So, emulsion , we call it  because there is continues phase and there is a disperse phase . 
So, it found s an intimate mixer of two or more  immiscible liquid  then we call it 
emulsion . 
And what is homogenisation ? Homogenisation is the reduction  in size of solid or liquid 
particle in the dispersed phase by the application of intense sh earing  force . So, the 
equipment  we used for this application  is high speed mixer s, pressure humanizer and 
colloid mill , ultrasonic homo geniser . So, we will see that one by one , how they perform 
and also we will see a few detail of the emulsification  and homogenisation  process . 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:28)  
 
So, size r eduction of liquid food . In that emulsification , when we want to  prepare two 
kind of  emulsion  liquid  liquid - liquid emulsion , one is oil in water  i.e. milk another  one 
is water in oil emulsion i .e. margarine , So, more complex emulsions are found in such 
products such as ice cream , sausage meat and cakes  because oil in water emulsion in 
milk or water in oil emulsion in margarine  these are most common . when we go for the 
ice cream preparation  or cake preparation or sausage meat preparation , that time the 
formation of emulsion the formation of a liquid - liquid emulsion structure will be more  
complicated . Now, there can be naturally occurring or synthetic emulsifying agents that 
we commonly use. So, naturally occurring emulsifying agents  that are protein and phospholipids  that we use 
in the processing . In the synthetic  agents are esters  of glycerol or sorbitan  esters of fatty 
acid. So, synthetic emulsifying agents maybe polar and nonp olar type . Those that contain 
mostly polar group bind to water and therefore  produce  oil in water emulsion . And 
nonpolar emulsifying agents , these are absorbed to the oil to produce the water in oil 
emulsion . So, we have seen that where the importance of polar and nonpolar emulsifiers  
occurs . 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:54)  
 
Now, if we look int o Homogenisation , the action of homogenisation reduces the size of 
the droplets  from  0.5 to 30 μm in the dispersed phase and emulsifying agent that are 
present in . So, they degrade the size of both of them or  it has been artificially added  also 
to the food , the emulsifying agent . So, this reduces the interfacial tension  because size 
has been  reduced to  very low size from the initial size fract ion. 
So, because of this lot many energy is required and  this reduces the interfacial tension 
between the phases  and prevent the droplets from coalescing . So, phases because the , the 
phase difference between the bubbles and the continuous phas e, continuous liquid will be 
there . 
So, interfacial tension between these bubbles and the  liquid  phase will be lowered  and 
that will that prevent the drops to coalesce  once again and form the higher particles . The 
higher the interf acial tension between the continuous and dispersed phase s, the more  difficult it is to form and maintain the stable emulsion . So, somehow,  we need to lower  
the interfacial tension . Emulsifying agents therefore, lower the energy input needed to 
form an emul sion. 
So, this emulsion and dispersion , you might have done some experiment in the lab where 
you have seen that to make an emulsion we need to give  very intensive energy input . So, 
that we can create the , we can reduce the interfacial te nsion between the , the droplets and 
continuous medium . 
(Refer Slide Time: 16:07)  
 
Now, emulsions  these are characterized by their hydrophile and lipophile balance  that is 
called the HLB  value . Hydrophile and lipophile balance by which they can added to the , 
water or the  lipids or the polar and nonpolar material . So, these  agents that  the 
emulsifying agents that we use they may have low HLB  value or high HLB  value . 
So, these  agents with the low hydrophile and lipophile  balance value when it is < 9 are 
lipophilic and use d for water in oil emulsion . Water in oil  emulsion just for example, 
butter or margarine  and those with the HLB  values between 8 and 11 are intermediate  
characteristics  and use d as wettin g agents . 
 And those with the highe r value that is 11 to 20 these are hydrophile and use d for the oil 
and water emulsion . So, we have three distinct cases when HLB  is very low, lower th an 
9, then this is emulsifying agents will  use for making the water in oil emulsio n. When this HLB  ranges from 8 to 11 then intermediate  that means, these  emulsifying age nts are 
use for increasing the wettability . When  HLB  value  is increasing 11 to 20 then the 
hydrophilic  nature is increasing and  oil in water emulsion wil l be there . 
Now, polar  emulsifying agents may be also ionic and non ionic types . Ionic types have 
different surface activities  over the different pH  range owing to the difference in their 
dissociation behaviour . However, the activity of non ionic emulsifie r is independent of 
the rang e of pH . We need to carefully select this emulsifying agent and is therefore, 
needed to create the required emulsion in a given food system . So, choice of emulsion is 
based on the types of the  product  and that  is very important . 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:44)  
 
Now, selected  emulsifying  agents use in the food processing has given in this diagram  
even in this  table . So, in the left side emulsifier list has been given , HLB  value is given at 
the middle and the function s and typical applic ations are given at the right . 
So, one or two we can see for example,  in the ionic emulsifier phospholipds  is there as 
for example, lecithin  and this is use for crumb softening of the baked products . And that 
is also potassium or sodium salt of oleic acid, these  are use to aid to extrusion and 
reduction in the  sticki ness of fast snack food , chewing gum , etc. 
Similarly , if we look  into the  non ionic emulsifier , so, there are also glycero l 
monostearate that we are  using for anti sterling effect crumb softening  for the backed product . So, we can see that both ionic and non ionic emulsifier s are exist for this  baked 
product  softening . There  are hydrocolloids also like alginate , carboxymethyl cellulose , 
carrage enan , etce. 
So, based on  what is our application , we can select different kind of  this material . For 
example, bloom reta rdation, in the chocolate we have seen the fat bloom that is the fat 
crystallisation may happen on the surface of the chocolate  sometime . So, that can control 
by propylene glycol  fatty acids ester . Sorbitol easter of fatty acid , so, using this we can 
reuse the fat bloom on the chocolate surface . 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:50) . 
 
Now,  when we want to see the liquids using emulsification and homoginization 
behaviour . The factor that  influences  the stability of the emulsion , that is very important 
and that can be you know related using Stokes law. Expression of terminal velocity  is 
𝑣=𝑑2𝑔 𝜌𝑝−𝜌𝑙 
18𝜇 
Here the velocity is the separation velocity of the separation of the phases . ‘d’ is the 
diameter of the droplet in the dispersed phase , ‘g’ is the accelera tion d ue to gravity value 
is 9.81m2/s. ‘ρ’ is the density kg/m3 of the dispersed phase and ‘ρl’ is the density of the 
continuous phase of the liquid . ‘μ’ is the viscosity of the continuous phase .  Now the equation indicate s the stable emulsion are  formed when the droplet size  are 
small  in practice between 1 to 10μm. So, this will be 1 to 10 μm and t he densities of the 
two phases are  reasonably close and the viscosity of the continuous phase should be 
high. 
(Refer Slide Time: 22:49)  
 
Now, there are different kind  of equipment used for liquid  homogenization and liquid 
emulsificati on. So, one is high speed mixer , high speed mixtures used  turbines or popular 
to premix the emulsion of low viscous liq uids. And pressure homogenizer , pressure 
homogenizer actually works on the principle of turbulence and cavitation  this is how the 
pressur e hom ogenizer look  like. The feed is coming from one side and there is  a wall and 
as a wall and homogenizer  product which is coming from this inner  gap between these 
two, these two call ed the impact ring and there is a  wall she et also . 
So, continuously thi s valve is facing on the  valve seat and the fat globules are  in a (Refer 
Time : 23:44 ) and small particles will form and that will eventually  mix with the 
continuous phase . So, what happen exactly , that will see . The collapse of this air  bubble s 
which is called the cavitations  and impact forces  create d in some wall b y placing a hard 
surface , hard surface is a valve sheet here . (Refer Slide Time: 24:09)  
 
So, this process is being done in homogenization  of the  milk. So, high pressure pump  
that we  use here  has the  pressure of 10000  to 70000 ×103 Pa. Homogenising valve which 
is fitted on the discharge side, so, we have just now seen that this is the discharge side 
from which  the product is  (Refer T ime: 24:35 ) particles smaller particle is coming out . 
So, in the discharge in the valve is there . 
Liquid is pumped through the small adjustable gap that is up to 300 μm between the 
valve and the valve seat. And the high pressure produces  a high liquid velocity that is 80 
to 150 m/s. Then and almost  instantaneous drop will be there , instantaneous  the liquid 
velocity is very high because of the pressure . Now, instantaneously the velocity is  
dropped as the liquid emerges from the valve and mix with the in the continuous section . 
So, this extreme condition of turbulence produces powerful sh earing forces and the 
droplets in the disp ersed phase become disrupted . So, the collapse of the air bubbl e 
which is called the cavitation and im pact f orces created in same valve  by placing a hard 
surface or  a breaker ring sometime in the path of the liquid , we can further  reduce the 
size of the globule . 
So, this is how because of the turbulence and cavitation , the size of the globule is 
reduced because of the pressure of homogeniser  action . (Refer Slide Time: 26:00)  
 
In milk products , there may be  inadequate distribution of emulsifying agent . Over the 
newly formed surfaces which causes  the fat globule to clump  together . So, therefore, a 
second similar valve is used to break up those cluster of the globules , ok. So, pressure 
homogeniser are widely used before pasteurization and ultra high temperature 
sterilization of milk  and in the production  of the salad cream , ice cream and some soup 
and sauce s. 
So, because of  the efficiency of pressure homogeniser to handle the  viscous or semi 
viscous liquid and to  make the emulsification  better , the ice cream  production and also 
the salad  cream production soup and sausage  production , use this special homogeniser 
technology . (Refer Slide Time: 27:06)  
 
 Now, the next is colloid mill , colloid mill s are essentially disc mill with a small 
clearance 0.05 to 1.3 mm between a stationary disc and a ver tical disc rotating at 300 to 
15000  rpm. These  are used for fine grinding , puree , food paste and pulp and are process 
by this colloid mill  more effective than the pressure homogenizer for the high viscous 
liquid . However, for the low visc ous this colloid mill is not suitable this is form the 
clump or  aggregation . 
For example , if for the high viscous product like peanut butter , meat or fish paste  this 
colloid mill is used . So, disc may be mounted horizontally as in the paste mill . The 
great er friction created in viscous food may require this mill to be cool ed by 
recirculating . So, recirculation  we can we can have by chill ed water  to cool the system . 
So, here the feed is entering from  one section and this is the disc  whic h is rotating and 
here from the very fine gap it is coming out the other side . This one is a rotor and this is 
called the casing . (Refer Slide Time: 28:49)  
 
Next, we have ultrasonic homogenizer , ultrasonic homogenizer use high frequency 
sound wave , rangin g from 18 to 30 kHz to cause alternate cycles  of compression and 
tension in low viscous liquid and cavitation of air bubble occurs . So, this is how it looks 
like. The feed is entering from one side there is an orifice which release very fine amou nt 
of the particle through this and there is a blade which is giving a cutting action to this, 
there is a crystal sensor and the product outlet . 
So, sound waves are created which cause the alternate  cycles of the compression and 
tension in low visc ous liquids and cavitations also occur . This is used for production of 
salad cream , ice cream , synthetic cream , baby food and essential oil emulsion s. (Refer Slide Time: 29:51) . 
 
Now,  all this emulsion and  the homogenization that we do , they have  certain effect on 
the quality of the  food that we produce . So, size reduction  is used in pr ocessing to 
control the textural or rheological properties of the food to improve the efficiency of 
mixing and heat transfer . So, this is t rue for solid  particle size reduction and also for the 
size reduction of the liquid material . 
So, when we increase the  surface area so  obviously, the transfer process this can occur 
across the surface area will enhance  that is one thing . Also, the similar type of particle , 
similar size and similar  shape of the particle , similar  characteristics of the particle will 
have better flow behavior both for the dry flour material and for the wet material . 
So, if you look into the effect  of this size reduction  on the viscosity or texture  especially , 
if we consider a particular food  where we practice homogenization such as milk . So, 
homogenization reduces the average size of the fat globules from  4 μm to  < 1 μm and 
thereby giving the  milk a creamier texture . (Refer Slide Time: 31 :46) 
 
if you see homogenization have an effect on the colour of some foods . For example milk , 
if you see how it is affecting . Homogenization  has an effect on the colour o f the milk 
because larger number of the fat globules causes  greater amount of reflectance  and 
scattering of the light . So, this scattering of the light  from all the fat globules uniformly 
changes  the colour of the milk .  
Now, flavour and aroma are improved i n many emulsified food , because volatile 
components are dispersed throughout  the food  hence , has greater contact with taste buds 
when they are eaten . So, flavours  are improved in certain cases . 
The nutritional value of emulsified food is changed if  components are separated for 
example, butter making , if we separate the  components the lighter and heavier 
components when we separate the n the nutritional value will be definitely going to be 
affected . And there is improved digestibility of fats and prot eins owing to the reduction 
in particle size . So, when particle size reduces , the digestibility of the fat and protein will 
also improve . (Refer Slide Time: 32:58) . 
 
Now, also on the nutritional value , we can see that  the food is based on different 
formula tion. So, the composition  is an important thing . And based on the formulation 
used, it is not directly affected by the emulsification or homogenization . It is affected as 
the composition changes . 
However , the additional unit operation what we perfo rm some time after this size 
reduction thing for example chilling  freezing , chilling of the milk or freezing 
phenomena , baking of the flour , etc. So, they are necessary to extend the shelf life and 
may cause changes to the nutritional value . And all f ood emulsion degradative  changes ; 
that means, the hydrolytic rancidity or oxidation of the pigments , aroma compounds and 
vitamins microbial growth  on the finely dispersed material these are minimized by  
careful  control over the processing , packaging and storage condition .  
Because all of this cases , chances of this (Refer Time : 34:10 ) reaction will be high , if we 
do not maintain the proper storage or proper environment condition or do  not follow the 
proper processing . 
In many countries special r egulations are there to control the hygienic  standard during 
the preparation of food emulsion . Particularly  in meat and dairy emulsion owing to  the 
risk of dispersing pathogenic bacteria throughout the food because when we perform this 
kind of operation . If any contamination was there from  prior of  collecting the  sample , 
then it will have a tendency to spread out , so that is why we need to be very careful . So, here we will stop , the size reduction  chapter is over by now . So, we will move on to next 
topic in the next class . 
Thank you .
