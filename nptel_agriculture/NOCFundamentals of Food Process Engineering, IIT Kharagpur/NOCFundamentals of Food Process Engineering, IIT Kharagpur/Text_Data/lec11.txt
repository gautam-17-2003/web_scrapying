Thermal Processing and Kinetics of Microbial Death  
 
Hello everyone, welcome to online certification course  Fundamentals of Food Process 
Engineering . We have completed the first chapter, which was on food rheology . Today, we 
will start a new chapter on thermal processing and kinetics of microbial death . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:45)  
 
Thermal processing means any sort of food processing involving heat ok. So,  thermal 
treatment can be used for either processing that is for conversion of raw material to a desired 
food and also thermal treatment  can be used for preservation . 
So, let us see  descrip tion of how we ca n divide these thermal processes ; although, there are  
many thermal processes, but the common processes are if we use hot water or steam for 
processing that  is blanching pasteurization and heat sterilization. There are also evaporation 
and dist illation and extrusion, which  can be done using the hot or steam. The heating 
operation in this , processing can be done by hot water or steam, there are also certain 
processes, where hot air is involved like dehydration or drying, baking, roasting  some 
processing, where heated oil is used as for example, frying . 
So, all such treatments can be come under the thermal processing, but  if we consider the first 
three that is b lanching pasteurization and heat sterilization. These three is used for 
preservation of food materials . So, in this course, we have designed a separate chapter on 
evaporation and dist illation and also on drying. So  here in this chapter the thermal processi ng 
and microbial death kinetics;  we will discuss only the preservation techniques; that are  being 
used by application of heat.  
Now, when we talk about heat transfer, we know that there are two modes that either  steady 
state or unsteady state  heat transfer in ce rtain food processing operation, w e use the steady 
state heat transfer ok; that means,  whatever heat is coming into the system  or the control 
volume. We are discussing and the same amount of heat, the same rate of he at is going out of 
the system . 
So, most of the processes  where we do the continu ous operation ; let us say for example, a 
heat exchanger ok, which is continuously operating and the conditions of the two fluid that 
are used in the heat exchanger is  being constant like the inlet temperature of  a milk that is 
entering in a heat exchanger and the outlet temperature is maintained co nstant and also the 
other fluid  which is used to cause the heat transfer . So, that is also  inlet and outlet 
temperature is maintained constant . So, in such process what  happened that we eventually 
reach a equilibrium state or a steady state and at the steady state operation, the whole process 
continues. So, in such cases we  generally considered the steady state heat transfer, but in 
certain cases where unsteady process a re very important, because  some processes, some food 
process  techniques are such that we eventually stop the process, when the centre point 
reaches at a particular temperature. For example, here we have mentioned that heat 
sterilization which is a thermal processing, which is the preservation technique.  
So, in that normally suppose, we want to sterilize one can of food. So, we want to see that the 
centre temperature should reach the desired temperature level or the set temperature at which 
we want to perform the sterilization. So, in that case starting from the initial temperature to 
the final temperature , that is being designed the food has to attain that temperature over 
duration of time.  So, in such cases the unsteady state heat transfer is required .  
So, although , in your heat transfer , subjects maybe this steady and unsteady state, heat 
transfer will be covered, but , we want to give here some basic idea of this unsteady state heat 
transfer. So, that the further processing in this , thermal processing that we will discuss like blanching pasteurization and heat sterilization will be clear to you. So, next we will discuss 
about the unstead y state heat transfer process . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:27)  
 
So, unsteady state or transient heat tr ansfer , we call this as unsteady state heat transfer, 
because the temperature of a body at a given point changes with time. So, rate of a transfer 
also varies with time. So,  what happens that in this kind  of heat transfer.  Initially, every 
heating or cooli ng process is unsteady as I said that initially, we start the unsteady state and 
eventually, we reach an equilibrium condition and that is considered as the steady state heat 
transfer.  
For example, if we discuss the immersion of potato in a boiling water. So, potato  must be 
having an initial temperature, which is , with respect to the am bient temperature. Let us say T 0 
and when we immerse it in into boiling  water , the temperature may be near 100oC. So, then it 
attains that temperature gradually. So, this attainment follows, the unsteady state first unless, 
it reaches the , equilibrium condition . 
Similar case happens for freezing of food. We do the freezing by exposing the food sample to 
chilled air or very-very cool environment. So , gradually this unsteady state heat transfer starts 
to happen in the food material and then gradually it reaches the steady state condition.  
So, we know that the basic heat transfer equation, when we frame for any system. The things  
we need to consider is the rate of heat coming i nto the system plus any rate of heat generation 
into the system will be equal to the rate of change of heat content of the system plus the rate 
of outflow of the heat from the system . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:14)  
 
Here we will see that.  When we have reached the steady state , then we can see in this picture 
where we can see that its a slab of thickness L and wid th W height H through this Q  amount 
of heat is flowing from the side where the temperature is T 1 to the other side where the 
temperature is T 2, because  the gradient is from T 1 to T 2 as T 1 >T2, “A”  is the heat transfer 
area across which the heat flows.  
Now, here the steady state has been arrived; that means, whatever Q is c oming into the same 
amount of Q is going out no accumulation is there, neither the heat generation within the 
wall. So, what happened the temperature profile will remain constant and so is the heat 
transfer ; however, if  we consider the other slab which is  just beside this, where again L is the  
thickness across which the he at transfer is taking place.  If we conside r this as the direction x  
the other two direction y and z are maybe infinite lengths . 
So, what happened that if the initial temperature o f this block is maintained at T 0. The whole  
system is having the temperature  T0. So, T 0 in both the side of the block remain constant. If 
this is dropped into a plunge into a sink o f having a higher temperature T 1, then the surface 
will attain the temperature T1 instantly. If the surface convective heat transfer coefficient is 
very high and what happened the internal structure that eventually with time the material will 
try to attain the temperature T 1. So, this profile which was earlier flat will try to change this 
way, unless it again will reach an equilibrium condition. So, this thing that  the temperature 
profile is varying from T1, T2 to T 3, this is because of the unsteady state heat transfer.  
So in this case the temperature profile is not constant and a lso the rate at which  heat is 
coming into the system will not  be same as  that is going out of the system. So, there will be a 
difference in rate of heat transfer because of some accumulation. So, as it will try to 
equilibrate with the ambient temperature.  
So we have seen that how with successive time t1, t2 and t 3 after the su rface temperature 
changed from T 0 to T 1 at time t= 0, the block will try to equilibrate the temperature within it . 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:26)  
 
So, because of this  a concept is introduced in this unsteady state h eat transfer, which is called 
as lumped parameter analysis. So, lumped parameter analysis, we will see that it will be 
applicable for certain cases where we have some  consideration of the geometry of the 
material.  
Here we will also introduce a dimensionless number  that is called the  Biot number. So,  Biot 
number is represented by the internal conductive resistance divided by the external 
convective resistance. So, let’s take an object which is having  very high thermal conductivity.  
That means  very low internal conductive resistance whose s urface area is large compare to 
volume. So, internal resistance (L/K) will be very small or negligible in comparison with the 
convective or surface resistanc e that is represented by 1/h, where “h”  is convective heat 
transf er coefficient at the surface.  Since the conduction is very high we can s ee that if this is 
the material  everywhere the same temperature prevails. So, temperature of the body is 
uniform that is only function of time.  
Biot number  is the ratio of int ernal conductive resistance (L/ K) to the external convective 
resistance (1/h). So, this can be represented as  
Biot number = hL/K  
Biot number should be < 0.1, so that we can consider this case as lumped parameter method  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:50)  
 
So, in case of lumped parameter analysis, as I said that initially when body was a t fixed 
temperature  where T equal to T i when time t=0 and when time t>0, T = f(t) . So, when this 
body is plunged int o a sink having a temperature T a. So, heat will co me out of  the system if 
this T a is lower than the body temperature or else i f this T a is higher than this. So, this body 
will gain temperature and that temperature that that heat that will come out , can be 
represe nted as  
Qconvection =hAs(T−Ta) 
 
Where, h is the surface convecti ve heat transfer coefficient, A s is the surface area of the b ody, 
T is the temperature and T a is the  system temperature or the sink temperature . V is the 
volume of the body and ρ and c are the density and specific heat of the solid or the other 
material.  
So, change of this internal energy in the body that will be equal to the convective heat 
transfer between the body and the system. So, the internal energy change will be  
Eout=mcdT
dτ=−ρVcdT
dτ 
If we can represent this by time and we can equate this with the convective heat transfer.  
Qconvection =hAs(T−Ta) 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:32)  
 
So, finally, we are getting this  
hAs T−Ta =−ρVcdT
dτ 
We can integrate this equation.  
ln T−Ta =−hAsτ
ρVc+C1 
Now, we can introduce the boundary condition here. When, τ=0, T=T i ,      
C1=ln Ti−Ta  
ln T−Ta =−hAsτ
ρVc+ln Ti−Ta   
So, this can be further written as  
 
T−Ta
Ti−Ta=θ
θi=e −hAsτ
ρVc  
Represented in terms of two dimensionless number s one is B iot number B i, another is the 
Fourier number F 0.  
T−Ta
Ti−Ta=θ
θi=e−BiFo 
We have discussed  Biot number already and Fourier number you may know  because in the 
heat transfer it has been covered.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:02)  
 
So, biot number as I said, this is the dimensionless number which is representing the ratio of 
internal conductive resistance to heat transfer divided by the external convective heat transfer 
resistance.  
Bi=hLc
k Fourier number is  the ratio of rate of conduction of heat across the characteristic length to the 
rate of storage of heat in a volume.  
F0=ατ
Lc2 
Where, α is thermal diffusivity given by,            α = ρCp/k 
So, Fourier number  is giving the expression  of the storage of heat in a volume. So, this two  
dimensionless number which is very useful in case of unsteady state heat transfer, because 
based on that we can finally, determine the transient heat transfer or the temperature profile  
with time in case of  any food material.  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:39)  
 
So, we are talking, talking about the characteristic dimension  in these numbers, in the  Biot 
number. So, this characteristic dimension is actually represented as  
 
So, we know that  Biot number should be less than 0.1, so that we can apply the lumped 
parameter analysis on this kind of system.  
So, for sphere  object characteristic length will be  
𝐜haracteristic  dimension =volume
surface  area lc=4πR3
3 
4πR2=R
3 Similarly, for solid cylinder:  
lc=πR2L
2πR(L+R)     if lc≫R,lc=R
2 
Characteristic  length for cube will be  
lc=L3
6L2=L
6 
Characteristic  length for rectangular plate :s 
lc=lbt
2lb=t

Now, next we will consider the Fourier’s law of heat conduction for those materials  where 
the internal resistance exist, because the first case we have considered where the internal 
conductive resis tance is negligible; that means, the thermal conductivity is very high. Now 
we will see the case with internal resistance. First we are taking the Fourier’s law of heat 
conduction.  
So, this is the unsteady state  Fourier’s law of heat conduction in three d irection. So, here we 
are considering the generation of heat, rate of heat generation or heat accumulation is 0. So, 
temperature change with respect to time will be a constant alpha into the heat conduction in 
different direction; that is 3 dimension, it i s a 3 dimensional case. So, three different 
directions  x y and z this will be the equation.  
 
Now, if we neglect the heat transfer, conductive heat transfer in the other two directions ; that 
is y and z, only we consider the x directional conductive heat transfer. So, this equation will 
reduce to  
                                           
Here, α is thermal diffusivity.  
                                            
Where , k is thermal conductivity of the materi al,  ρ is the density and C p is the specific heat 
of that material.  
So, in this block we can see that how the temperature will change when the intern al resistance 
is present. So, T 0 was the temperature of this block , which is where we are considering only x 
directional heat transfer and in the y and z direction we consider the neglect , we are 
neglecting the hea t transfer there. So, T= T 0 was the temperature and if we  drop this block in 
a temperature in a low temperature sink. So, it try to reduce the s urface will come instantly to 
T1, but because the internal conductive resistance exist s, it will  move to the equilibrium state 
in an unsteady process . 
So, here we will consider a dimensionless temperature paramet er to solve this equation, that 
parameter is  Y;  
T0 is the initial  temperature of the block and T 1 is the temperature of the outside  sink or 
surrounding T is at any instant temperature variation  of the block. So, if T= T 0, Y will be 
equal to 1 and at time  t=0. For all x this will b e valid, be cause when t= 0 that is initial 
condition. So, the who le block was at a temperature T 0; therefore, at any x this will be valid.

𝐓𝟎−𝐓𝟏 Now, if suddenly this is plunged  into a system of temperature T 1. So, x= 0, the temperature 
will attain T 1 and Y becomes 0 also at x=L  that towards x direction the extreme end at t= 0, 
also b ecome temperature is equal to T 1 and Y become 0.  
(Refer Slide Time: 29:24)  
 
Solving one dimensional unsteady state equation by variable separable method  we are 
getting.  
Where, A and B are constants and a is  a parameter. Now putt ing those boundary condition 
those were  listed in the earlier slide, we are getting  
 
So, here putting n equal to 0 , 1, 2 we can get the terms and  we can also , we can find those 
terms, but eventually we have seen that  in the, in the s tudy that these terms except the first 
term does not significantly contribute to the  calculati on of the temperature profile  unless the 
temperature of the of the sink and the body is very close.  
So, that is why most of the time we consider the first term  only that is putting n= 0.  
 
So, we will stop here and will continue this topic only in the next class.
