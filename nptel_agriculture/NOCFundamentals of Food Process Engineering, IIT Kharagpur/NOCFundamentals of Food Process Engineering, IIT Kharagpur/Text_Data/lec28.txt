Drying Technology (Contd.)  
 
Hello everyone , welcome to the NPTEL  online certification course  on Fundamentals of 
Food Process Engineering . We in the last class we  have discuss  the Drying Technology 
and in that , we were discussing the different psychrometric processes ok . And how we 
can describe them  and describe the ai r properties in the psychrome tric chat. 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:48 ) 
 
today we will see that  first moisture  content  so, since we are  dealing with the drying 
phenomena and  drying we normally perform  to reduce the moisture content . And with 
that we are lowerin g the water  activity to increase the shelf life of the product because , 
moisture content is a important phenomena all the contamination or the degradation of 
the food material  is caused by principal ly the moisture content ok. 
So, all the microbiological  contamination or enzyme  enzymatic degradation if you want 
to decrease  so, first of all we need to lower the moisture content . Then this is very 
important that how we can express the moisture content or how we can calculate the 
moisture content ? So, moisture content can be expressed either percentage wet basis or 
by percentage dry basis .       
In wet basi s:                                   M.C (%w.b)=𝑀𝑤
𝑀×100  
In dry basis:                                   M.C (%d.b)=𝑀𝑤
𝑀𝑑×100  
Here  M represents  the total weight of product  i.e. weight of the moisture present in the 
product plus weight of the bone dry material .  
Mw= weight  of moisture present in the product,    
Md =bone dry weight or weight of dry matter   
Now, in this one form to the other we can convert ok , so, how we  do that . So, the relation 
between moisture content wet basis  and moisture content dry basis .  
                                       M.C (%w.b) =𝑀𝑤
𝑀×100 =𝑀𝑤
𝑀𝑤+𝑀𝑑×100  
 Divide both 
  & D r By  “Md” 
𝑀.𝐶(%𝑤.𝑏)=𝑀𝑤
𝑀𝑑
𝑀𝑤+𝑀𝑑
𝑀𝑑×100  
𝑀.𝐶(%𝑤.𝑏)=𝑀.𝐶 (𝑑𝑏)
1+𝑀.𝐶 (𝑑𝑏)×100  
Similarly, we can convert this moisture content dry basis to  wet basis as well . 
𝑀.𝐶(% 𝑑.𝑏)=𝑀.𝐶 (𝑤𝑏)
1−𝑀.𝐶 (𝑤𝑏)×100  
So, always moistu re content in the dry basis is  higher than the moisture content wet basis  
because the denominator is reducing . So, always we are getting this as higher value . (Refer Slide Time: 03:44 ) 
 
And then , we will see that if we are given that certain condition  that we need to dry the  
product to achieve the safe storage level , then how we can perform . So, let us take  500 
kg of  paddy dried  from 20 percent  moisture content wet basis to 15 percent  moisture 
content wet basis . We need to calculate the amount of water  that nee ds to be removed 
during drying .  
Amount of water in feed (M w1) = 500 × 0.2 = 100 kg  
Bone dry weight = 500 – 100 =400 kg  
Now amount of the water finally, after drying  will be how much  that we need to 
calculate ? So, let us say some amount of moisture will remain that is Mw2. 
Amount of water in product:                0.15(400 + M w2) = M w2 
                                                   Mw2 = 70.588 kg   
 Water evaporated (w) = M w1 – Mw2 = 100 -70.588 = 29.41 kg  
This kind of calculation is very common because , most of the time when we want to 
store any grain , food, we need to know that what is the safe  storage moisture level and 
we can convert it to dry basis or wet b asis. And then we finalize that how much moisture 
needs  to be taken out ? (Refer Slide Time: 05:47 ) 
 
Now, moisture determination method,  there are many direct and indirect met hod of 
moisture determi nation . So, in the  direct method , we use mostly h ot air oven , vacuum 
oven , then Brown duvel distillation method , infra red method. In all this mechanism  like 
what we do in the hot air oven ? We keep  2 gram  of the sample and then we keep it at 
almost 105±2 °C for 24 hour. And then we measure that what is the bone dry weight of 
the material and initial weight was known to us  so, we can calculate that , what is the 
moisture content ?. 
And similarly , there are certain indirect methods , where  we are not directly measuring 
that by gravimetric method that what is the amount of moisture is evaporated ? But some 
indirect measurement technique we are using for example, where measuring the 
electrical resistance in the universal moisture meter  ok. Then we can measure the 
dielectric  method and also the chemical method  so, electrical resistance in the sense that 
moisture  is having certain amount of conductivity ok . 
 So, if the moisture  is reducing  so, that can offer the electrical resistance we can measure 
because of the changing mo isture level . So, universal moisture  meter  measures that 
changing electrical resistance , because of the changing moisture content . Similarly , the 
dielectric method we know that dielectric  property that also depend on the moisture 
content because , moisture  has a dipole  rotation . And then because of the  orientation and reorientation of the moisture  the water  
molecules , the dielectric heating mechanism  will change  so, because of that we can 
measure the , what will be the moisture content in this method .  
Similarl y, some material are there , they can absorb moisture . So, they are  hygroscopic 
material , they can absorb moisture and based on  change of their weight we can measure 
that how much amount of the motion has been  taken or absorbed by them . So, there are 
certain indirect method and certain  direct method for determination of the moisture we 
can use any of them as per the availability . 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:35 ) 
 
Equilibrium  moisture  is the moisture content of the pro duct in equilibrium with the 
surrounding air at given set of temperature and relative humidity . So, this is because that 
the ambient always have a fixed temperature and relative humidity  and any product  if we 
keep in the ambient it will try to  come to equilibrium with the ambient ok . 
So, the moisture content  of the product in equilibrium with the surrounding air at a given 
set of temperature and relative humidity that is called the equilibrium moisture content . 
And this equilibrium moisture content chang es with different RH. So, it will be  more 
clear if we  if we , draw the diagram of equilibrium moisture content versus equilibrium 
relative humidity ok . And this particular curve  is drawn generally at a particular 
temperature and it is fix for a particular product as well . Because the products having different kind of  you know different structure  some are 
having very loose structure , some can have the property of absorption  of the of the 
moisture in a higher amount . So, they show the hygroscopicity or  you kn ow formation of 
the lump and many  different  quality . 
So, because of that , when we want to  calculate that what will be the EMC  or Equilibrium 
Moisture Content , we need to draw the curve of equilibrium moisture content with 
respect to water activity or equil ibrium relative humid ity at a particular temperature . 
So, that is why this is called the isotherm  and moisture  sorption is that because , when we 
perform the drying  operation  so, the product is losing moisture . And generally  when  we 
dry we make the powder in a grounded form because , if those are very you know the 
very fine particle , then they have more surface area . And the more surface area can 
absorb the  more am ount of water from the am bience . 
So, in that condition , if those product we expose  to increa sing water activity or 
increasing relative humidity ambience at a particular temperature . So, the product try to 
absorb moisture . And if we keep it at different changing  water activity or changing 
relative humidity  environment at a constant temperature , at a constant temperature  so, it 
will show this kind of a plot  which is called the sorption isotherm . 
So, this sorption isotherm can give us the idea, that corresponding to  corresponding to  
what relative humidity , what will be the EMC  value ok ? So, as the relative humidity will 
change , equilibrium moisture content will be changed at a particular temperature . If we 
change the temperature , then maybe we are getting a differ ent kind of sorption isotherm . 
So, the main purpose of this is sorption isotherm  can give us an idea , whether the 
material gain or lose moisture ; that means, if we know  the sorption isotherm of a 
particular product . And let us say  the moistur e content of the product is now  5 percent 
wet basis  and or let us say 15 percent wet basis . And then  we expose this product to a 
higher amount of  relative humidity  so, the chances are that this product will absorb 
moisture right  and will reach  from 15 let us say 30 percent in due course of time . 
Now, if the product moisture  is having higher valu e and it is  kept at a condition which is 
very low relative humidity , then the product may be  loosing the moisture . So, whether 
the material will gain or lose moisture  that depends on the sorption isotherm behavior . So, what is the rate of moisture remov al? That we can  guess  out of this plot and also it 
will help us to determine the dr ying characteristics .  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:47 ) 
 
Now if we see the  different moisture content in a bit detail , so, there we can get the 
bound moisture and unbound moisture  these two basic classification . So, this is a relative 
humidity versus moisture content curve  at a particular temperature  so, this kind of a 
curve  we are getting . 
when the relative humidity is 100 percent and if the moisture content in the in the x axis 
we have moisture content . So, then this moisture  where we get the free moisture  
available  so, this is called the unbound moisture  and rest of the moisture  is called the 
bound moisture . 
So, from the unbound moisture , which is the moisture  exert the vapor  pressure equal to 
that of the pure water  And the bound moisture  which is physically or chemically bound 
to the solid matrix and it exert  the vapor  pressure less than that of the pur e water at the 
same temperature . 
Now, if we further  lower t he moisture content  so, corresponding to a particular relative 
humidity , let us say  this point A we are  getting the moisture content . So, that is the EMC  
that is the equilibrium moisture content  so, at this condition excess of the free moisture  
excess of the EMC  is called the free moisture . And if we consider at 100 percent  relative humidity  so, as I said that  bound  moisture  is 
equal to the free moisture .  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:28 ) 
 
Now we will see the hysteresis effect  so, what is hysteresis effect ? This is actually when 
we perform the drying  operation ? So, then we decrease the moisture content of the 
product  so, initially if the moisture content was at this point when  it has drying  has been 
perform and moisture content has been reduced to very low value . 
Now after that if that  dried material is exposed to increasing water activity  so, again it 
starts absorbing moisture right . So, it will try to absorb moisture , but these two curve  will 
not similar . They will be there will be a de viation between these two plot and this 
difference in the desorption  and absorption curve of the equilibrium moisture content 
verses  ah; relative humidity at a specific temperature is called the  hysteresis effect . 
So, if we look into this cha rt carefully , in the  in the b eginning of the water ac tivity zone  
that is 0 to 0.3 almost , in this zone  the moisture  is strongly bound with the  molecular 
structure . So, these are the monolayer moisture content , beyond  0.3 to around 0.75,  here 
in this zone , in this  water activity zone the moisture is less stro ngly bound , less strongly 
bound and layers and capillary adsorbed water is there , beyond 0.75 the water is in the 
form of solvent and the free water . So, this water can be very easily removed ok , then there is a the process of water removal 
will be bein g slowed in this  the second zone which is of the 0.35 to 0.75 water activity 
zone and as we move towards higher  water activity . So, pressure is also increasing and or 
temperature also increasing  so, temperature we can have different  temperature , 
difference  option isotherm . 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:59 ) 
 
 Now method to determine the EMC,  one is the static method and another is the dynamic 
method . So, in the static method ; what we do ? Temperature of the air is maintained  by an 
oven and relative humidity of the a ir is also maintained by the use of different 
concentration of  solution . Basically , we use  different salt solution to maintain the 
different  you know water activity . 
And there is a dynamic method ; which is the desorption method and isoteniscopic 
method ? So, in the isoteniscopic method what we do is ? We keep  we take a isoteniscopic 
which is kind of  u tube  and that is immersed in a liquid that is  being heated at a particular 
temperature that is again connected with a bulb . 
And here we measure the  you know different pressure , vapor pressure and  corresponding   
water activity of that ok . So, by measuring that there is a manometer  attached to that , 
which measures the different pressure  level , because this is connected the u tube  is 
connected with it ok. And we sometime release the pressure  so, that it will  take the vapor  
out of  it and again let us  keep it to come to the equilibrium situation . So, in that , we measure the  change in the vapor  pressure time to  time and corresponding  
the water activity . So, with that , we can relate  the different  we can calculate the different 
water activit y and moisture content relation .  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:12 ) 
 
Now, there are different  models available those are the  equilibrium moisture content 
models that works for different ran ge of the relative humidity , as we have seen that , the 
if you follow th e range of relative humidity the curve pattern changes . So, in different 
different section , different equations , which have been  some are  derived empirically  or 
some are based on the  physical principles . 
So, these are the certain models one is the Kelvin  equation that is based on the capillary 
condensation theory . And valid for RH >95%,  
ln 𝑃𝑣
𝑃𝑣𝑠 =2𝜎𝑉 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼
𝑟𝑅𝑇𝑎 
Harkins  Jura equation that is based on the potential field theory valid for very low 
moisture content region that is RH < 30 %. 
ln 𝑃𝑣
𝑃𝑣𝑠 =𝑑−𝑒
𝑉2 
 Chung pfost  equation that is again potential field theory  valid for RH: 20 -90%. . So, we 
can see that  this equatio n has a very wide applicability.  
 ln 𝑃𝑣
𝑃𝑣𝑠 =−𝐴
𝑅𝑇exp⁡(−𝐵𝑀) 
Henderson  equation , which is valid for all relative humidity range works on the Gibbs  
adsorption principle .  
1-rh= exp[ -CTMen] 
So, in all th is equation  RH is the  equilibrium relative humidity in the decimal , capital Me 
which is the EMC i.e. equilibrium moisture cont ent in dry basis percent,  T is the 
temperature in degree Kelvin , c and n are the product constant varying  with the 
materials, Pv is the vapor  pressure of grain , Pvs is the saturated vapor  pressure  at that 
condition , σ is the surface tension , V is the volume of moisture , α is the angle between 
the moisture  and the capillary and r is the radius of the cylindr ical capillary , capital R is 
the universal gas constant and Ta is the absolute temperature . 
So, using all these  model  we can we can get the idea if the  so, in this model for example, 
if we use the Henderson  equation . So, if RH is known to us we can find o ut the 
equilibrium moisture content value at that condition and  accordingly we can , we can 
store it for a required  relative humidity and temperature ambient . 
(Refer Slide Time: 24:24 ) 
 If temperature of grain and relative humidity are 30oC & 10%. The value of “C” and “n” 
are 3.11 ×10-7 K-1& 3.03 respectively. determine the EMC value using Henderson 
equation.  
So, temperature is given and  RH is given  C is given n is given  so, we will just put in the 
equation  Henderson  equation . So, we will get the final value of e quilibrium moisture 
content as 10.14  percent dry basis  ok. So, if this is a safe  condition of storage at th is RH 
level . So, if we  give higher than this obviously, the moisture  the product will lose 
moisture  and if we keep lower than this it may absorb moisture .  
1-rh = exp[ -CTM en] 
                        ln(1-0.1) = -3.11 ×10-7 (303)M e3.03 
                          Me=10.14% (dry basis)  
(Refer Slide Time: 25:37 ) 
 
Now coming to the drying rate curve , so, for any drying  expe riment the assessment of 
the drying rate is very important . Most of the cases ,  in the in the food material  of very 
high moisture content , although we are not getting very  elongated  or very prolong  
constant rate drying  generally , we get very short  constant rate drying and then we find a 
falling rate drying . 
So, if we normally see , the moisture content versus time plot , the first plot where 
moisture content percentage dry basis has been plotted against time in hour. So, starting 
from ABC  to E this will be the normal  drying curve will look like this and if we plot the drying  rate R with respect to moisture content . Then we can follow ABCD  and E, this 
will be the pattern of the drying rate curve . 
Now, if we consider  when the air is coming on the water film, which is surrounded the 
product . So, outside moisture will first  evaporate  and the inner moisture  will try to 
defuse to the surface ok , till that flow is  you know exist ; we are getting the constant rate . 
And when the inner  moisture also received to the pockets and the shrunken  cells and the 
flow of the moisture  is not  very very high from the inner layer to the surface . And the 
surface moisture receive s, that time the falling rate starts , falling rate  is again governed 
by many principal  like diffusion , liquid  diffusion , capillary diffusion , etcetera  so, 
initia lly, the product temperature may be higher  maybe higher or lower than  the drying 
air temperature  or ambient temperature . So, for the initial adjustment  period , we can 
observe where either  the product  will gain or  lose temperature little bit . And then  it starts 
you know constant drying rate  start. 
So, the time till we are getting the  free moisture available at the surface or the rate of 
evaporation is equal to the rate at w hich the moisture  is coming from the inner layer to 
the surface , exist then we are getting the constant rate. And after that , when we reach to 
the critical moisture content Xc corresponding to the this point C, then the falling rate 
starts . 
Again they maybe  different  phase of the falling rate  we can see , here in this particular 
case we are getting two distinct falling rate one is C to D and another is D to E. So, 
finally, when it reaches to E that is corresponding moisture content XE is the  equilibrium 
moisture content at the RH and temperature condition prevailing in the drying chamber . 
So, in the in the falling rate , if we see that the first thing like C to D. So, here the change 
in moisture , because of the un saturated surface dry ing this is called the first falling rate 
and in the second  phase this is internal movement of the moisture . So, that controls the 
drying  so, we are not getting a very straight line here, but a little curved surface we are 
getting . So, these are the  mechanism , that the inter nal movement when it takes the 
control of the of the rate of moisture  movement , then we are getting the curve pattern . 
So, this is how we can calculate the drying curve , now most of the time  if we want to 
want to plot the moisture content versus time , we g enerally plotted  with the free moisture . So, in that case we find the equilibrium moisture content at that condition and  
what we can do is initial moisture X0 minus  if we  do XE so, that will give the free 
moisture . 
So, based on  free moisture versus time , we can  calculate the  you know  drying rate  we 
can draw the drying rate curve also based on that or we can draw the moisture content 
versus time plot also based on free moisture . So, this we have already mentioned that XC 
is the critical moisture content , where the constant rate completes and the falling rate  
starts and EMC  is the  final moisture content , equilibrium moisture content with the 
temperature and relative humidity of the d rying air . So, beyond this we can not lower the 
temperature in a drying  experi ment . So, always the, the moisture content will be 
corresponding to temperature and relative humidity of the drying air . 
 (Refer Slide Time: 31:01 ) 
 
Now, drying  time calculation , so, we can divide the whole process of drying into 
constant rate and the falling  rate period . So, for the constant rate period , since the  rate is 
constant in this case , so, if we know that , what is the change in the moisture content  at 
any instant ok ? Because moisture content we express in kg H2O/kg dry matter . 
Change  in moisture content with respect to time can be given by  
 
If we integrate this  with boundary  conditions applied :  t=0 X=X1 & t=t X=X2  
R=−Wd
AdX
dt  
we can think of this condition like when the wet surface is there this maybe of grain  or 
any food surface . So, when the air is passing over that the air  will give the heat  so, that 
the wet surface will start drying  and moisture will evaporated  in the form of a flux which 
is NA and it is again  mix with the air stream . 
So, the moisture flux  which is mixing with air stream  will cause increase in the humidity 
of the air, product will be getting dried . Drying will happen at a temperature of wet bulb, 
that is t w and Hw is the humidity of the surface , H is the humidity of the air stream that is 
used for the drying . 
So, then, if we want to analyze  the heat and mass transfer that happened in case of drying  
because , we know that drying is a simultaneous heat and mass transfer operation . So, the 
product i s getting dried  so, the mass is removed from the product and getting mixed with 
the dry air . And simultaneously , the heat is  coming from the dry air to the product and 
utilizing  the heat the produc t moisture will b e evaporated . 
 So, if we consider that what is the amount of heat that is coming from the air to the 
surface ? That will be given by:  
q= hA(t 1-tw) 
Now, the material  the moisture will be evaporated taking the latent heat of vaporization .  
            q=M ANAλwA  
So, this we can write and finally, if we want to chan ge this mole fraction to the humidity  
so, then we can write  
          q = λwAk yMB(Hw -H) 
So, then we are getting this equation  so, that is this much amount of heat required for  
evaporation of the moisture Hw to H and this heat is coming from  this heat that is  the 
convective heat transfer from the air  to moisture .  
 
This Rc equation , if we put into this equation t c. Then , 
 
tc=Wd
ARc X1−X2  
Rc=q
Aλw=h(T−Tw)
λw=kYMB(Hw−H) 
tc=λwWd
Ah(X1−X2)
(T−TW)=Wd(X1−X2)
kyMBA(Hw−H) Now , the h  is convective heat transfer coefficient , that can be further  related to the mass 
velocity (ρ.g) of the air stream because , we need to know that what will be the 
convective he at transfer coefficient of the air to the  moisture .  
h=0.0204G0.8 (if air flowing parallel to drying surface)   
h=1.17G0.37 (if air flowing perpendicular to drying surface)  
 
(Refer Slide Time: 39:35 ) 
 
Grains are dried in a pan (0.25× 0.25×0.01m). Heat transfer is only due to convection of 
air (velocity 5m/s) flowing parallel to surface of material. Temperature & humidity of 
incoming air 60oC & 0.01 kg H 2O/kg dry air. The wet bulb temperature of air is 25oC. 
Humidity & latent  heat at T w is 0.025 kg H 2O/kg dry air & 2450kJ/kg. calculate the total 
rate of evaporation.  
So, first we need to find what is the  humid  volume here 
V= (2.83 +4.56H) ×10-3×(T+273)=(2.83+4.56×0.01) ×10-3×333=0.9575  
volume we have calculated and kg will be amount  of 1 kg air plus kg of moisture present 
in that air. So, 1 plus H by so, we are getting 1.0547  is the density of air kg per meter 
cube . 
ρair= (1+H)/V = 1.0547   
 (Refer Slide Time: 41:24 ) 
 
Next will be  G, which is  the air velocity  so, here air is flowing  parallel  
G = air velocity ×  ρair = 5.2735 kg/m2s = 18984.6 kg/m2h 
h= 0.0204 G0.8 = 0.0204 (189840.8)=53.99 w/m2K 
Constant  drying rate is calculated as follows  
 
Total rate of evaporation = R c × c/s area  
                          = 2.5722 ×0.25 ×0.25 = 0.161 kg H 2O/h  
We will stop here.  
Thank you .
