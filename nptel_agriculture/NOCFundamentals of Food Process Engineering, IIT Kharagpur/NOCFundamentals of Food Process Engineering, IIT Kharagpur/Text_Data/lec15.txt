Thermal Processing and Kinetics of Microbial Death (Contd.)  
 
Hello everyone , welcome to the  NPTEL online certification course on Fundamentals of 
Food Process E ngineering . Today  this is our last class of chapter 3 that is Thermal 
Processing and Kinetics of M icrobial  Death. So, we have discussed about  the therma l 
destruction curve and mic robial survival curve  D value  z value and also certain  problem  
we have done . 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:54)  
 
Today  we will continue  with some more topics  in that . So, first is spoilage probability . 
So, you know spoilage  probability is very important , whenev er we want to process  set of 
cans or any food material , because we  want to make the probability always  < 1, because 
if it is 1  that means, there is a chance of contamination . So, we always want to lower it 
from the  absolute value . So, we can  calculate  in this manner that  if n1 and n 2 are the 
initial and final number of  viable  microorganism  per container respectively . So, number 
of container s in the batch is ‘r’. So, then we can write it as F that is the  process time, D is the decimal reduction time at 
that temperature .  
F=D log rn1
rn2  
  
So, we can write in this way  so the number of container  in batch if it is  ‘r’. So, out of r 
what is the probability of spoilage of can? So, what is the number of can that may be 
spoil  after this treatment as  well so that we need to find . Now if the objective is to reduce 
the population to single organism per batch . r×n2 is the final  microbial load in each 
batch. r  contai ner in each batch and in each container there are n2 number of 
microorganism . So, to a single organism per  batch indicates r×n2 =1. So, putting r×n2 =1 
in above  equation we can get : 
F=D log(rn1) 
So, from here if we calculate  1/r that indicates the chances  of one container spoilage out 
of all  r right . So that means finally, we want to calculate  1/r; that means, the chances of 
spoilage of one can out of the r number of cans .

So, if we take one example on that , estimate the spoilage probability at the end of a 
process in which an initial microbial population of 2 × 105 organisms per container  is subjected to heating at 118◦C for 45 min. The decimal reduction time for the organism is 
D118 = 3.5 min.  
So, we need to find the spoilage probability that is  1/r. an initial population of  2 × 105 
organisms per container  this is n1. F118 that is  the process time is given 45 minute . So, we 
are giving a processing  to those containers for 45 minutes at  118 °C, D118 is 3.5 minute . 
So, what will be the final  microbia l load ? So F/D is sterilizatio n value  that is 12.857.

r value we got is 3.6 × 107 that means, 1 micro -organism is present in 3.6 × 107 
containers . So, the probability is very low 3.6 × 107 containers . So, there is a chance tha t 
1 microorganism in  those  containers may be alive that can  cause the contamination . So, 
the probability is very very low . 
(Refer Slide Time: 07:31)  
 
So, then sterilization value  and lethality of a process ; sterilization value  we are 
discussing since  the last class i.e. S = number of decimal reduction = log(N 0/N)  
In a constant temperature process, S and F values can be easily converted between each 
other .   
S=DT
FT F0 value is a measure  of the sterilizing value  of a process . 
Now, it can be thought of as  time required at a temperatu re of 121 °C to reduce the 
microbial number by the same amount as the actual process be ing considered . So,  F0 
value it is thought of  as the time required at a temperature of  121 °C because this is our 
reference temperature  in a Celsius scale . So, at 121 °C to reduce the microbial number  by 
the same amount as the  actual process  is bein g considered for example, let us say 114 °C 
and the process time we have calculated . So, we want to calculate that F0 value ; that 
means, what is the time required to proc ess it towards  the same microbial destruction at  
121 °C. 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:02)  
 
And what is lethality factor or L value ? It is defined as the time at 121.1 °C which i s 
equivalent in sterilizing value to one  minute at some other temperature . 
That means if we  want to  destroy the number of micr o organism at  any temperature  in 
such a ratio i.e. log of  (N0/N). So, that the process time at that tem perature is 1 minute 
only, so the same  microbial destruction if we want to cause at  121 °C. So, this time 
required at  121 °C will be term ed as lethality factor . So, FT/F0; FT is the process time  at 
any other temperatur e. L-value can be  expressed as  FT
F0=L=[10]T0−TT
z Where , T0 is the  reference  temperature  TT is the temperature at which the processing has  
been done for 1 minute , and z is the  temperature dependence of that particular micro  
organism . 
So, an example is th at A product is held at a temperature of 118°C for a period of 12 
minutes. Ignoring other heating and cooling periods, what is the F o value of this process? 
So, considering held at a temperat ure. That means this is only the holding time we know 
that for any kind of heat treatment  we need to first  heat it then we try to maintain that at a 
particular  temperature s during holding  period . And then, gradually it is being cool ed. So, 
here i gnoring th e heating and cooling period we want to  focus on only the ho lding period 
i.e. at 118 °C for 12 minute we need to find the  F0 value for this process . 
So, the lethality value for  118 °C will be 0.490 . So, we can calculate the  L value . L value 
is 0.490 that is each minute at  118 °C contribute to 0.490  minute to the F0 value . F0 value 
means the processing is done at  121 °C. Therefore, the F0 value of this process  will be  
12×0.490 that is  5.9 minute  ok. So, if this  product is held at a temperature of  118 °C for a 
period  of 12 minute  and if we want to do the  same processing same destruction of  
microbes at  121 °C that is our reference temperature as  Celsius scale we need  5.9 
minutes . 
(Refer Sli de Time: 12:31)  
 Now, coming to the general method for process calculation : in a real retort processes , the 
temperature of the product is not constant . We have mentioned that it first follow the 
unsteady state heat transfer , the temperature that is being given to the food material is 
first increase the temperature to the  required temperature  of the processing . 
Then it is to be hold  or maintaine d at that condition for certain period and then gradually 
it cools down  ok. So, to calculate th e F0 value of such  process , the contribution of the 
varying temperature must b e converted to the equivalent  F0 value . That means, if you 
know the process is being  gone through various temperature . And then we want to 
convert it  to F0 value  so, what that all temperature ti me combination will  mean or they 
will contribute to the  F0 value . 
So, individually at each temperature we want to calculate them , and then we need to sum 
up them to get the final  F0 value . So, this is achieved by  based on the  L value i.e. 
lethalit y value . So, graphical and numerical integration bo th methods  can be used to 
calculation of this lethalit y value . 
(Refer Slide Time: 14:08)  
 
First we wi ll see the graphical method . So, what we do is first we will draw a graph of 
the product temperature ver sus time . Now this temperature will be  changing with respect 
to time as initially heating then holding and then the cooling period will be there . So, it 
will change with time . So, after that we will calculate the  L value for each temperature . So, lethality value that is one  minute processing at that temperature , will be equivalent to  
lethality value  at 121 °C so, that we will calculate first  and plotting the lethal rate against 
time. So, then we can produce this kind of a plot where we have plotted the lethal rate in  
y axis and the time in minute in the x axis. And then calculating  the area under this curve  
we can find the total  process calculation or the total process time or  F0 value . 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:40)  
 
Now, since the  graphical method is very tedious . So, the easy method for this  calculation 
process  in case of this unsteady  heat treatment method is numerical  integration method . 
So, what  we do is , lethality is computed by multiply ing the lethal rate by the time 
interval . 
So, we take very small small time interval , and lethality the average lethality  at each 
temperature , each time  combination  is been multiplied with that  to get the accu mulated 
lethality during the entire heating and cooling . i.e.  
lethality  =F0= L dt= 10T−T0

Process  calcul ation for commercial sterilization . 
Ideally the temperature if we  look into  the profile of temperature , we know that it has to 
start from  a certain product temperature and as the heating continu es it should increase . 
Then, at the start of the  holding it sh ould maintain that particular temperature  TM at 
which the processing should be  done ideally . And then, it lowers again to cool it . 
However , the actual product temperature may deviat e from that basically the center  
temperat ure, which is the slowest heating  point . For example, if you are dealing with  the 
can then the center  axis of that can  may achieve  the heat very slowly . So, that is the 
farthest point where the heat  may reach at  a later time and then the center point may be 
shown by this kind of a curve . 
Where the surface may attain  the temperature of the  processing , but the center may attain  
it at a later period of time or may  not fully attain  it may be slightly lower than that . So, 
the tem perature of the slowest heating point does  not reach to TM. So, the operat or time t p 
is basically the difference between the ti me at the end of product heating , that is  here we 
have stopped heating  up to this point and then we have started holding . So, from here to 
when the retor t reaches a stable heat ing medium temperature ; that means, when the 
product core that is our slow est heating point has reach the  stable temperature let us say 
as this section . So, that tim e is called the operator time t p. 
Now beyond that when it attains it can  again start de creasing or lowering  that depends on 
the condition  to condition . (Refer Slide Time: 19:33)  
 
So, example that  D121 =1.1 minute,  z value  = 11°C ,  Initial count =105 /g, and the largest 
container to be used is 1000 g. spoilage probability at the end one container per 10,000. 
Temperatures at selected points in the process are as follows:  Calculate minimum 
holding time to achieve desired result . 
First heating  is being done , then holding , then cooling . Heating it has started from  0.5 
second the temperature has reached to 104 °C, and then temperature  at 1.3 second is 
111°C like that  when it is being done at 6.5 second it is  138 °C. When it reaches to the 
holding section 8.3 second and till  it is it is hold up to  12.3 second  the temp erature is 
maintained here at 140 °C, then cooling start from  12.9 second  and goes up  to 16.2 
second where th e temperatu re has reduced to 106 °C. 
So, calculate the minimum holding time to a chieve the  desired result . That means, the 
probability at the end of  one container per 10000  container , and als o each container is 
having  1000  gram product . (Refer Slide Time: 21:35)  
 
So, what we  need to do first we calculate N0. So, N0 is 1000  gram and initial load  is 105. 
So, initial load per container is  108. Now the final  microbial  population expected is  
1/10000  or 10-4. 
Sterilizing value = log (108/10-4) = 12  
 So, basically  12 log cycle reduction  we want . Now F value at  121.1 °C is S×D121.1. Then  
we need to find out lethal rate .  
lethal  rate (LR)=[10]T−140
z 
The maximum lethality that will be offered in  the holding section  is 140 °C. So, lethal 
rate we  need to find . Now if we want to plot it starting from  the midpoint of the can of 
each can , the midpoint we want to measure first , that with increasing time in second what 
is the condition of the midpoint . And based on that using above  equation  we will 
calculate the lethal rate first . So, we can see that at 7.8 it has reach ed to the temperature 
of the midpoint  139.4  °C and then  it has been constant or held at this temperature . So, 7.8 
to 8.8, 9.8, 10.8 to 11.8. 
So, till 4 second it has been hold  at this condition  and if we consider the total processing 
time starting from the heating to the cooling . So, the total lethality  if we  try to find we 
are getting that F140 is 6.505  second . So, this total has been done at  different temperature 
we have converted them all to the  lethality of with respect to the 140 °C. So, this is coming 6.505 second  if we you know calculate them all . If we calculate the m all the  total 
we will get the  value as 6.505  second  using this equation of lethal  rate. 
Now, F121 will be  calculated:  
 F121=F140[10]T−T0
z=6.505 ×[10]140−121
11 =347  s=5.79 minutes  
So, we have seen that 13.2 minute was given as F121 right . So, 13.2 minute  is being given 
and he re the additional 7.41 minute at  121 °C is st ill required.  So, F140 the process time 
for 7.41 minute at 120 °C will be : 
F140=F121[10]121−140
11 =7.41×0.0187 =0.139 minutes  
So, what we have done ? Then first lethal rate we have calculated total lethal  rate at  140 
°C than this much lethal rate will be e quiva lent to how much in the  121 °C. So, that is 
coming 347 second , but the F121 for 12D inactiva tion has come 13.2 minutes . So, then 
the remaining  7.41 minute at  121 °C we need to  provide to the product he at treatment  for 
this much time . Now this  121 °C temperature exposure for  7.41 minute is equivalent to  
0.139  minute at  140 °C. So, total t ime will be total time will be 4 second that we have  
hold it  plus 8.31 second that  we are getting from here ok. 
Then  we are getting that  this is that time required for h olding at this temperature of F140 
to ach ieve the destruction of  12 log cycle for this particular micro  organism . 
So, we will stop here  chapter three  has been completed and we have  given  the reference 
in our course outline . However , I would like mention that we  have referred  the book of 
Toledo  for this section of the micro bial death kinetics  and also the Zeki berk and PG 
Smith. So, you can refer those problems has been taken f rom there , and there  are lot 
many  exam ple problems and  problems in the  reference is also given . And we will also
