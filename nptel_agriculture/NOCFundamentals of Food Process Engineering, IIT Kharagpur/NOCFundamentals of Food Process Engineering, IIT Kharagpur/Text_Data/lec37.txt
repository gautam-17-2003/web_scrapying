Size Reduction (contd.)  
 
Hello everyone, welcome to the NPTEL online certification course on  Fundamentals of 
Food Process Engineering. We will continue today with the topic of Size Reduction , and 
we have started this in our last class.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:34)  
 
We have discussed about the introduction related to the requirement of size re duction , 
objective of size reduction in the  food processing and industrial scale o f food processing 
operation.  We have also learn that how to define a single particle in a in a mixture of a 
bulk so lid, what are the different  equivalent diameter by that we can express the particles  
in a bulk mixture  and also we have  learn this concept that there is a need to identify the 
distribution of particles in the bulk solid mixture, because not a single size is available  
mostly in case of this .  
So, there is a distribution of different size  is available most of the time a nd we need to 
find that the predominant size fraction in that mixture. So,  we will today discuss in detail 
the particle size d istribution, and also other topics  in this particular  chapter that will  
cover with due course of time.  (Refer Slide Time: 02:06)  
 
Now , we will start  particle size distribution today . In the last class if you remember that 
there are different kinds  of equivalent diameter that  we have expressed  that is based on 
the sieve size opening through which the particular diameter of the  particle  pass or  
equivalent diameter particle should pass, or we have seen the based on the settling 
velocity, or based on the size fraction we can we can differentiate . 
So, there are many methods  to find the  different particle sizes  or distribution of particl e 
sizes. The very common one is the microscopic  analysis by which the different sizes can 
be easily separated. There are other methods one is elutriation , settling or sedimentation  
and there is laser  diffraction  based on that also we define the equivale nt diameter.  The 
most common one and easiest one is the  sieve analysis . 
In the sieve analysis also there are many  standard sieves are available  one of which is the  
Taylor series which is the US standard based and in that  if we considered the distribution 
based on the sieve analysis. What we do is; we keep the product on the perforated 
screens or sieves and then  there are certain sequence of steps are there that we put a stack 
of the sieves and then we vibrate it for a certain amount of tim e. 
So, what will happen that the particle sizes which is lower than the  equivalent diameter 
of the perforation will come down to the  next lower fraction of the sieve, and which is 
the bigger one will retain on the upper s ieve.  Now , in most of the time  100 % efficiency may not be reached . So, some  fraction of the 
particle may retain on the  sieves on the upper sieves and some will pass through. So, 
those will retain on the sieves may have fraction of  the particle which is having the size 
lower than the opening of the screen, but even though they will not pass through the 
screen . So, the efficiency of the screening is defined as th e ratio of the mass of material  
which passes the scr een to that w hich is capable of pass ing. This is an important 
parameter in you know understanding t he particle size distribution . 
So, efficiency is based on the size of the material , what will be the size fraction  based on 
that the efficiency is defined. It may be assume that the rate of passage of the particle of 
a given size to the screen is proportio nal to the number or mass of the particle size on the 
screen at any instant . So, this is important because this will form our basis of analys ing 
the different particle size . 
So, if we want to  express this  in terms of a mathematical expression let us consider that 
‘w’ is the mass of particle  mass of a p articular  size. On the screen at any time ‘t’ then we  
can write : 
 dw/dt = -kw 
‘w’ is the mass retained on a sieve on a part icular sieve at any instant.  Since  this will 
reduce with  time we have kept a minus sign here.  ‘k’ is the constant for a given si ze and 
shape of the particle  for a given screen. So, this is how the rate of  passage of a particle 
we can define . (Refer Slide Time: 07:35)  
 
So, then  mass of a particle  if we consi dered in this session that is w 1 is the mass retained 
on a particular size of  screen or sieve  at an instant when t  =0. After  time‘t’  if the mass is 
a reduced to w 2. So, the mass which is already passed through will b e w 1- w2, which is 
passing the screen at any time . So, if this is happen, then we can write  
ln (w2/w1) = -kt 
So that means, it is exponentially reducing the number of the mass fraction of the m ass 
of the material on a particular sieves  is reducing in a fashion of exponential  decay curve 
on a particular size of the  screen . 
So, w 2 that is remaining at any time will be : 
w2 = w 1×e-kt 
 ‘k’ will depend on a particular size of th e sieve and the material.  Now, quantitative 
indicatio n of the mean size is important  and quantitative integration  is a in the sense that 
what are the different fraction and what is the mean size I mean the size which is 
dominating a fraction. So, we need to define  the mixture in terms of that particular size 
and the result of a size analysis can most conveniently be represented by means of 
cumulative mass fraction . So, cumulative mass fraction curve  in which the proportion of 
the particle ‘x’ smaller than a  size‘d’  is plotted against the size ‘d’. So, this is cumulative 
mass fraction x is showing the cumulative mass fraction . So, if we considered that at any instant the ‘x’ fraction which is smaller than t he size ‘d’. 
So, as we move from zero  to th e higher size if any instant we reach. So, the fraction 
which is the left  side of that will indicate that the size smaller than that particular size 
‘d’. So, here  this representation is a result of the sieve analysis which is cumulative one . 
So, we have adde d the fraction which is larger than this particular size ‘d’, so then 
further we can say that.  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:41)  
 
If we take the size frequency curve , size frequency curve in the sense the fractio n of 
having a particular size d d. So, if we take the size fr equency curve and then plot with 
respect to the size d so this  is a curve. The slope  dx/dd of cumulative fraction  plotted 
against  particular size ‘d’. So, the slope of that curv e when we have plotted with respect 
to the particular size we are getting this curve which is called the size frequency curve . 
So, there are many benefit of this curve , this can tell us many thing that  one is the mos t 
frequently occurring size is then  can be shown by the maximum of this curve . So, the 
fraction we are getting at maximum poin ts here the frequency is higher  that means, the 
particle size of this particular fraction will be higher  mass fraction in the who le 
distribution . 
So, for naturally occurring material that curve will generally have a single peak and for 
mixture of the particle there may be as many peaks  as components in the mixture. So, 
what happened that when there are different  mixtures or different compositions are there . So, those have different size fraction so it may happen that in one lot one particular size 
is having dominated. So, we may get  different or more than one  peak in the frequency 
curve size . 
Now, if the particles are formed by crushing larger  particles. The curve may have two  
peaks one is the  characteristic of the material  because the material has a certain 
orientation and upon getting a  similar kind of food they have a tende ncy to break  in a 
definite size . So, other is the characteristic of the equipment; so the way the force is 
coming it will have a tendency to make the particle in a definite kind of shape. So, 
because of these two  you have we may get to definite high frequency  plot in th is 
frequency curve.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:30)  
 
Now, mean particle size so , now we need to express one particular size to express the lot 
of a distributed  bulk particulate solid material  and this expression of the part icle size of a 
powder or granular  material, in terms of a single linear dimension is often required . 
So, considering that because we have taken the single linear dimension is equivalent 
diameter most of the time . So, considering all particles are of same s ize unit m ass of 
particle consisting of ‘n1’ particl e of c haracteristic dimension ‘d1’. Similarly ‘n2’ particle 
of size ‘d2’ constituting a mass fraction ‘x1’. So on is the basis of determining the  
particular size, be cause we will assume that the each fraction will have which is passed 
throug h letters a particular sieve . so that means, those having  lesser size than this particular opening of the screen. So, similarly a particular size  linear dimension has been 
fixed wh ich is dimension d 1, d2 etc. For each section x 1, x2 etc and the number of  those 
particle also is define as n 1, n2 like that . 
So, the n we can express that suppose x 1 that one fraction now we want to expres s which 
is having the size of d 1.  
x1= n1k1d13ρs  
So, when we want to express in terms in terms of the volume. So, linear dimension cube 
we need to express . So, k1d13 is defining the volume of one  particular material . Now 
n1k1d13ρs will give mass fraction of the particle  in that. Now , suppose if we do  all 
summation I mean ∑x1. So, ∑x1 =1.  
∑x1 =1=ρsk1∑n1d13 
‘ρsk1’ is the constant parameter which is based on the particular  sieve and the material.  
If you want to  calculate ‘n1’from this equation for a  particle of d 1 dimension in the 
fraction x 1 will be : 
n1=x1
k1ρsd13 
 Refer Slide Time: 17:21)  
  So, now if the size distribution can be represented by a continuous function, then  instead 
of ‘x’ now we write ‘dx’. So, ‘dx’ is the continuous fraction if we take very very small 
amount of  increment in that. So, ‘ds’ fraction because of the ‘dn’ number of  particle. If 
that fraction increased by ‘ds’ amount so, that is because of number of ‘dn’ increase in 
that size.  
dx = ρs k1d3dn  
then,  
dx
dn=ρsk1d3 
Now  we can integrate from fra ction 0 to 1.  
 dx1
0=1=ρsk1 d3dn 
Here, ρs is the density of the particle;  k1 is a constant value depends on the s hape of the 
particle . So, this is how we can represent the size distribution in a continuous function . 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:53)  
 
Now different mean particle size we will explain now, first one is the volume mean 
diameter ‘dv’. So, volume mean diameter is e xpressed as  dv= d dx1
0
 dx1
0= d dx1
0 So,‘d’ is a particular  diameter or the dimension and ‘dx’ is the  mass fraction that is  
increasing . Expres sing this relation in finite difference form we can write  
dv=  d1x1 
 x1=  x1d1  
So, d 1 is a particular dimension x 1 is the mass fraction of that particular dimension . 
Now in terms of particle nu mbers if you want to express rather than the mass fraction.  
dv=ρsk1  n1d14 
ρsk1  n1d13 =  n1d14 
  n1d13  
So, all whenever we want to express the particle numbers in the form of the particle 
number  will recall the  previous expression a nd try to relate with that. So, the previous 
expression for ‘x1’ was   
   x1= n1k1d13ρs  
When  we converted it to dx so t hat time will convert this to d 1. This concept we will use 
every time whenever  we try to express in terms of  number distribution of the particle 
right. So, we were in the volume mean diameter.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:46)  
 Now , next will be mean volum e diameter  (dv΄) which is represented  this way  
𝑘1𝑑𝑣′ 𝑛1= 𝑘1𝑛1𝑑13 
Volume  of all particles  will be equated to all the fractions of the particle  
Finally , we are getting : 
dv′=   n1d13 
 n13
 
Now , also we can  write it in this form of  mass fraction basis  as all other thing density 
and k will be cancel led. 
dv′=  𝑥1
  𝑥1
𝑑13 3 =  1

Now , if instead of the fraction of the total mass the surface area in each fraction is 
plotted against the size. If you remember  we hav e plotted  this in particular size ‘d’, and 
the cumulative mass fraction  we have taken as ‘x’ and then we have plotted. Now , 
instead of ‘x’ we can plot the surface area ‘A’ or we can represent it by ‘S’ etc. 
So, if we do so, that instead of a fraction of the total mass, if the surface in each fraction 
is plotted again size. Then similar curve is obtained although the mean abscissa ‘dS’ is then the surface mean diameter. So, the size ‘d’ that we have obtained  that will be here 
the surface mean diameter right. So, if we plot the surface area with respect to the  
diameter  of the different particle. The mean abscissa ‘dS’ that will get that will represent 
the surface mean diameter.  Now, what will be the expression for that?  
(Refer Slide Time: 24:50)  
 
dS will be:   
dS= n1d1S1
 n1S1=  n1k2d13 
  n1k2d12 =  n1d13 
  n1d12  
So, k 2 is a constant whose value depends on the particle shape as it is  same for all other 
cases. And d S is also known as the Sauter mean diameter, and it is the diameter of the 
particle with the same spec ific surface as that of the powder.  Specific  surface means the 
surface area to the volume. So, then it is  also represented in the mass fraction basis.  
dv′=  𝑥1
  𝑥1
𝑑1 3 =  1
  𝑥1
𝑑1 3 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:58)   
Then the size of the particle  dS΄ which is  such that if all the particle are of this size the 
total surface area will be the same as of th e mixture.  
𝑘2𝑑𝑆′ 2 𝑛1= 𝑘2𝑛1𝑑12 
Finally , we are getting : 
dS′=   n1d12 
 n12
 
 If you substitute the n 1 with the value of x 1 there is a mass fraction basis.  
dS′=   𝑥1
𝑑1 
  𝑥1
𝑑13 3
 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:44)   
So, there are many representation of this  another is the length mean diameter . i.e. 
dl= n1d1d1
 n1d1=  𝑥1
𝑑1 
  𝑥1
𝑑12   
So, a mean length diameter or arithmetic mean diameter (dl΄) may also be defined by  
𝑑𝑙′  𝑛1= (𝑛1𝑑1) 
 If you want to express in terms of  in terms of mass fraction that will become  
dl′=  𝑥1
𝑑12 
  𝑥1
𝑑13   
(Refer Slide Time: 28:41)   
Now , we solve a problem on that  a sugar crystal has the form of a rectangular prism, 
with dimensions 1×2×0.5 mm. Calculate the  diameter of the sphere  having the same 
volume, the same surface area  and the same surface/volume ratio (Sauter diameter)  
So, what we need to do; first we need to calculate volume of crystal.  Because  this is one 
rectangular one, so we have calculated 1 mm3. 
Surface  area of the crystal = 2(1×2+2×0.5+0.5×1)  = 7mm2 
So now, you got the surface area and also got the volume. For first, t his volume  should  
equivalent  to volume of sphere whose diameter ‘dV’.  
𝜋𝑑𝑉3
6 =1 
We are getting dV = 1.2 4 mm 
Second is diameter of a sphere with same surface area.  
𝑑𝑆= 𝑆
𝜋=1.49 
Here  we get 1.49 mm. And the last one is the Sauter diameter that is ratio of the surface 
area to volume. So, we know that surface area  we have got 7  mm2 and volume is 1  mm3. 
So, Sauter diameter will be 1.17 mm.  So, we can also  try to identify that which area is coming minimum, which dimension is 
coming minimum if we take the different specific  equivalent diamete r. So, what is the 
minimum diameter in which case it is coming that we can calculate.

Now, food material often  consists of different size, to characterize such particulate 
material it is necessary to determine their particle siz e distribution as  we are doing now. 
So, method for determination of particle size distribution include many that we have 
discussed already. Out of that sieve analysis is the simple technique commonly used for 
the determination of particle size distribution  and for  quantitative evaluation of the 
fineness of the powder . (Refer Slide Time: 31:52)  
 
So, this is the sieve  analysis set look like, a weighed amount of the material is placed on 
top of a  stack of the nested mesh sieve  with opening size decreasing fro m top to bottom.  
Generally  this size changes with a powe r of 2 , 21/2, 21/4 like that. The assembly of sieve is 
mechanically shaken or vibrated for a period of time.  
The amount of powder retain on each sieve is then weighed and recorded. So, particles 
are counted  based on arithmetic or number mean distribution or also the mass mean 
distribution we can  calculate.  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:37)  
 Then a frequency distribution curve as I mentioned that the dx/dd with particul ar size is 
plotted and  which give the particular particle size , the percentage of the total particle 
either on number or mass basis against that size so, that we can identify that which is the 
mode of the distribution. Alternatively, that data can be plott ed as a cumulative 
distribution, in which either the cumulative  percentage undersize or the cumulative 
percentage oversize is plotted against the size .  
When  we see this curve so we are gettin g 50 % of the size lower than this particular . Or 
if this one is the undersize and if we go by this curve so we will get the percentage 
oversize of that  particular material. So, like that for each size. if we suppose get thi s one  
that means, this much fraction has already passed through this particular diameter 
opening so that way we can analyse . 
So, both the way cumulative mass fraction and f requency distribution is done a nd from 
this we can get very good insight of  distribution of the particle, in terms of how many 
fractions are dominating , which is the maximum size , which is the mean surface  
diameter ? So many conclusions  we can  take out of this particle size analysis, particle size 
distri bution analysis . So, we will stop here and we will continue in the next class.  
Thank you.
