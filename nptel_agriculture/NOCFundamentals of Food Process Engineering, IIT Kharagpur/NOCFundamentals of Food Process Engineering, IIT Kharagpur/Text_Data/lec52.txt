Leaching and Extraction (Contd.)  
Hello everyone, welcome to the NPTEL  online certifica tion course on fundamental s of food 
process engineering. In the last class, w e have started the topic of leaching and extraction. We 
have discuss the basics of leaching and extraction process and few equipment that is used for 
leaching process.  
(Refer Sli de Time: 00:42)  
 
So, today we will discuss a very important thing that is the equilibrium stages for leaching . So 
considering equilibrium stages for lea ching. it can be plotted on the rectangular diagram as the 
weight fraction for the three components.  
So, we have thr ee components basically one is  the solute A that we want to separate f rom the 
mixture of inert or leached solid that is B and this process is done using the solvent C. So , A will 
getting mixed with the C and this A  initially is in B, which is  inert s o at the end of the process 
also B will b e inert m aybe some part of C will be mixed with that, but ideally we want to 
separate A in the C.  
So, the concentration of  inert or insoluble solid in the slurry mixture is given as follow ,   
 
So, as we ha ve mentioned that in the slurry mixture some amount of solvent will be there and 
some amount of solute will  be th ere. So ideally, suppose a solid miscella  is there a nd this I want 
to separate by contacting  it with a particular solvent.   
Then when the separ ation h as occurred and this  solid  become separated where we have mostly B 
that is inert material and t his liquid which was having C and here there was some amount of A  
which is solid. So , now it has moved with C  + A and here i t is B, but B was not as a dri ed one.  
So, B has some amount o f C that is the solvent and in that some amount of A will also be there.  
So, in that suppose the liqui d when it becomes equilibrium when this solvent and the solid when 
the extraction or leaching process takes place and we as sume that t he equilibrium stage has 
arrive  that mean s the so lute was there that has been leached to the solvent the maximum e xtent 
possible has been leached to the solvent.   
So, suppose in the solvent  initially the concentration of A  was 0 and in the solid  the 
concentration was 50 percent, s o if at  the end of the process suppose you know 45 percent of that 
A has been extracted so that 45 percent has come to this s olvent now.  So, when we take out th e 
solvent we are getting now 45 percent of that A . Now whate ver small amount of solven t will be 
associated with the B  that is the inert liquid that will also ideally have the same fraction or same 
concentration of C . Becaus e some liquid part  will be definitely there. So , this concentration of A 
if I say CA concentr ation of A in the C  stream or the solve nt stream and concentration of A in the 
stream that is overflowed in the process will  have same concentration. So, this ideally we call as 
the equilibrium condition. So , in that process the w hen we call the  concentrat ion of slurry when 
we want to define the concentration of inert solid in the slur ry then N is equal to kg of B/ ( kg of 
A + kg of C ).

Now , in the equilibrium, we will try t o see that what are the different  equilibrium stages an d the 
concentration in both the stream  that is the over flow str eam and also in the underflow s tream . So, 
underflow this is the s ettled solid leaving the stage. The settled  solid leaving the stage contains 
some liquid as I said that the inert solid B will n ot go alone or in a dried form, some liquid will 
be associated. S o, some liquid will be associated that i s called the underflow  and that l iquid will 
have some dissolve so lute as well .  
And overflow is the liquid containing the oil or containing the solute that is being extracted. So , 
that h as been taken away in overflow . So , the concentration of which is equal to the 
concentration of the solute in the liquid in the slurry. So , these two concentrations  that is 
conc entration of the solute in the o verflow and the concentrati on of the solute in the solvent  
which is going with the underflow these two  will be same .  
Hence, this is indicated by XY  plot on a 45 ° line. So , if we plot this concentration suppose I 
denote the concentration of solute in the o verflow by XA and this concentration of solute in the  
underflow solving that is Y A. So, this will follow a 45 ° line.  
So, when is it says that  the composition of solute A in the liquid fraction that is the overflow is 
given as X A means what kg of A that is solute di vided by kg of A + kg of C because the stream 
that is going in the o verflow will have the solvent as well as the solute.  
  
similarly the composi tion of solute A in the liquid fraction t hat is the underflow that is given by 
YA equal to kg of A divided by kg of A plus kg of C .  
 
 
 
So, we have  observe that these two are same one stream that is going out and the same stream 
some fraction some part of that str eam, which is going in the u nderflow with the solid so that has 
this concentration. So , XA and Y A ideally should be similar or should be same.

Now, a single stage leaching process when we consider th e single stage leaching, show n in a 
rectangular diagram . So, let us see, t his is a single stage leaching is occurring . So, we have the 
slurry solution which is entering the feed solution or slurry solution and we have so lvent which is 
entering, t hen this solvent will take some fraction of the solute and then it is moving out and this 
slurry which is again coming out as a slur ry from the first stage . 
So, V represent  the kg of solvent that is entered , L represent the kg of slurry that is entered, N 0 
representing the  concentration of inert solid, y 0 representing th e concentration of the solute i n the 
feed slurry . Similarly , y1 representing the solute concentrati on in the outgoing slurry and x 2 and 
x1 or x these represent the solute conc entration in the solvent.  
So, in a single stage  where L is the slurry entering , V kg/h  that is the o verflow sol ution which 
composition of X A, L kg  of the liquid that is in the slurry solu tion with composition of Y A. 
And so like that any A notation you can give to them X A1, X A2 like that. So , whatever so 
overflow s olution with combination of X A and L kg/ hour is a liquid slurry solution with 
compositio n of Y A based on the given flow rate of B in kg/hour of the dry solute free solid. So , B 
here is the dry  solute free solid in that term we are taking B as an inert.  
Now , the equilibrium diagram we will draw a square plot in that . This bottom a xis x axis 
represents N versu s XA. So, initially N  means the inert solid concentration in a total slurry that is 
kg of A /kg of C. So , in that the concentration of solute the c oncentration of the solute if  we 
consider that is Y A and XA that is the concentratio n of the solute in the solvent s tream .  So, XA will be 0 initially compared to this N  and as it moves the other direction, it is increasi ng 
because from 0  to all the solute fraction from the inert solid or slurry it is going to mix with the 
solvent . So, eventually XA will increase from 0 to 1 t he maximum fraction  will come out. 
Whereas the upper curve  that show s the underflow  that means t his is N versu s Y A.  
So, what happened that initially Y A was 100 %. So, the fraction Y A will be 1.0 so initially this 
was higher a nd as you know, the  slurry is getting mixed wit h the solvent and the solvent is t aking 
the so lute away s o, it decreasing,  YA is decreasi ng and X A is increasing. So, ideally if it happens 
then the concentration X A equal to Y A because that is the ideal case on in the equilibrium 
situation t his should happen for ideal extraction.   
So, those two concentration X A and Y A are same and this we have discussed already. So , in that 
case the tie lines are vertical straight lines. So , when we plot Y A versus X A will ge t a straight 
vertical line. So , this is  45 ° line . Now , what will happen that if s uppose there is a deviation  in 
the concentration of X A and Y A.  
So, that means whatever concentration was there in the slurry or in the feed  solution has not fully 
gained by th e solvent. So , there is always some gap . So, in that case will no t get the straight lines 
as the operating line. So , in that case we will get a little curve  as an operating line so that 
represent this will b e the concentration of Y A and there  will be the c oncentration of X A. So, we 
can get this kind of a plot when the tie lines are not vertical that means there  is a deviation 
between the X A and Y A.  (Refer Slide Time: 16:01)  
 
 
So, next is so single stage leaching now  we will do the material balance, so this is our figure if 
you if you remember that we have  L0, N0, y0 and B that is entering and here V 2, x2 that is 
entering here V 1 x1 that is  leaving stream or this is the o verflow and this is the underflow that is 
L1, N1, y1, B.  
So, considering that if si ngle stage mass balance  for total solution balance for solute A and 
solvent C  because if we know those to the other can be easily calculated. So , a component 
balance on A and a solid balance on B  that can be given respectively. So , the total balance will 
be   
 
 
L0 that is the free stream plus V2 solvent that  is equal to L1 that is the feed  slurry that is 
outgoing or did this is the underflow plus V1 which is the o verflow. So, this will be M a nd this 
will be constant .  
Now, the solute concentration in the feed  slurry is Y 0 so Y A0 into L 0 plus the entered  solvent 
stream if  the so lute concentration is having X A2 there so V 2 into X A2 that will be equal to L 1 into 
YA1. So, this is the  under flow that is goin g so L 1 into Y A1 plus overflow that is V 1 into X A1. Now, 
this will b e together coming as M into X AM, M into X AM. So, this is because when these two 
stream is getting mixed. So , let us say the separation will happen up to a certain bond, whic h is 
signified by the point M  when the equilibrium will be reached .  
So, that M the position of that point we need to find so that we can predict that what will be the 
extraction efficiency or what will be the separation what fraction of the separation of solute has 
been  done. So , M into X AM is required for that. Now , if you want to do balance on the inert 
material that is B, so B will be h ow much initially the stream L 0 has a concentration of N 0 for the 
B and the solvent did not have any  trace  of B. So, the total B will be equal to N 1 L1 + 0 that is 
NM into M.   
(Refer Slide Time: 18:52)  
𝐋𝟎+𝐕𝟐=𝐋𝟏+𝐕𝟏=𝐌  
So, then for a single stage case as  
 Where,  
M= total flow rate in kg of (A+C)/h.  
XAM and N M are the coordinates of point M. A balance on C is not needed. Since,  
initially we had L0 that is the feeds slurry and we had V 2 that is the solvent we had some X A2 for 
this V 2 and we have some Y A0 for this L 0.  
Now, when these two streams are gettin g mixed t hey will come to an e quilibrium at certain point 
M let us say so that M from the M again if we consider then t hey will be V 1 that indicating our 
overflow and that will have a concentration and here again  L1 is our slurry that is  going out. So , 
this will be the equilibrium point . Now , correspondence to this eq uilibrium what will be the X AM 
what  will be N M that we find so that we can get what will be the bulk liquid there a nd wh at is the 
concentration of the s olute. 
So, xA+ x C = 1  and y A+ y C = 1 . L 1MV 1 and L 0MV 2 lies on straight line. The point M is the 
intersection of two lines.  So, they has to reach to this point for equilibrium.

Numerical example#1:  
In a single stage leaching  of soybean oil from flaked soybeans with hexane. 100 kg of 
soybeans containing 20 wt% oil is leached with 100 kg of fresh hexane solven t.  The value 
of N for the slurry underflow is essentially constant at 1.5 kg insoluble solid/kg  solution 
required. Calculate the amounts and compositions of overflow V 1 and underflow slurry L 1 
leaving the stage.   
V2=100 kg,  
xA2= 0, x C2 =1, For entering s lurry syst em, B=100(1 -0.2)= 80 kg insoluble solid , L0 = 100(1 -
0.8)=20 kg A, N0= 80/20= 4 kg solid/ kg of solution. y A0= 1, 
To calculate the location of M,  
L0+V 2= 20+100=120=M  
L0yA0+V 2xA2=20(1)+100(0)= 120x AM 
xAM  =0.167, B= N 0L0=4(20)=80=N M(120)  
NM=0.667  
The point M is plotted along with V 2 and L 0. The vertical tie line is drawn locating L 1 and V 1. N1 
= 1.5, y A1= .167 and x A1= .167. Solving or using liver arm rule, L 1= 53.3 kg, V 1= 66.7 kg.

Multis tage counter current extraction  
So, in a multi -stage similarly like we had ea rlier one stage we have now 1 , 2 and  up to n stages, 
but the process will be same here this is a counter current leaching. So , we have to enter solvent 
from one side. So, here the  solvent is entering Vn + 1 in the nth stage with X n + 1 is the 
concentration.  And t hen it is moving on to stage 1 and there V 0 is coming out with X 0 equal to X 1 concentratio n. 
Similarly,  L0 YA0 that is the  solid or the slurry p hase that is entering that is L 0 and Y 0 and that is 
event ually coming to the end stage that is L n Yn. So, in this figure  mass flow of the light stream 
is denoted by V and the flow of the heavy stream by L t hat me ans heavy stream in the sense t hat 
is the slurry solution . And concentr ation in the light phase by x and the concentration the heavy 
phase  by y as we did for the earlier cases as well .  
(Refer Slide Time: 28:03)  
 
 
So, then we have to do the material bala nce for the multistage multiple stage counter current 
leaching . So,   
So, whatever solvent enter into n  plus 1 whatever slurry ente red into the first one, that we will be 
equal  to wh atever slurry  whatever s lurry came out from the n plus 1  nth what is the overflow 
came  from the first one then we do the component balance simi larly as we did for the single 
stage and finally from these two equation eliminate V n +1.  
 
So, from the b alance of the multiple stage counter current l eaching we have th is equation which 
shows the mass balance of  the solvent stream and slurry stream and then we have component 
balance that is t he solvent in that what is the fraction of the solid com ponent a nd what  is the 
component in the slurry. Similarly, w hat is the component in the overflow and what is in the 
underflow?  
Elim inating V n+1 between these equations, we have  
 
Xn+ 1 that is the c oncent ration of solute in the o verflow stream or we can consider this as a 
solvent entry for the for the other one  
 
 
So, this is how w e can observe here there was nth  stage and there was for the first stage t he 
everything th at is the entry of the slurry and exit of the overflow signified as L a Ya0 and V a Xa 
like that and here all are at n  + 1. So, this is the equation that we have to use .

Now, in many practical cases in which the equal qua ntities or equal molal  quantities of the 
carrying streams move from one stage to the other stage that is where the flow rates are the  same 
in all the context stages  then fo r the heavier phase or  slurry phase we can consider this L n + 1 = Ln 
= La = L and for the lighter phase again V n +1 (that is the solvent entered into the nth one )= Vn ( a 
overthrow of the nth one )= Va (that is for the entry of the first  one) =V. So, this i s the mass of the 
solvent that is coming.  
Now , a simplified equation can be written for s uch cases  
 
So, this method c an be applied where the flow rate from one stage to the other stage a re similar .  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:05)  
 
Now , once we you have to understand that how the equilibrium point is determined in case of the 
leaching experiments then the next stage is you have to calculate the efficiency of the leaching. 
So, for that the efficiency of a real contact  stage is a me asure of the deviation from the 
theoretical equilibrium condition because theoreti cally we should have equal Xa and Y a value 
but there s ome deviation from that.  
So, stage efficiency in all s tage contact process  is generally expressed as Murphee efficiency  that 
is denoted by  ηM 
 
 
X0=concentration of the extract entering the stage: X = actual concentration of the extract 
leaving the stage; X*= concentration of the extract at equilibrium .  
So, this will give you the idea of how efficient your sta ge pe rformance is in case of a leaching I 
mean this is true for  multi -stage leaching  or single stage leaching.
