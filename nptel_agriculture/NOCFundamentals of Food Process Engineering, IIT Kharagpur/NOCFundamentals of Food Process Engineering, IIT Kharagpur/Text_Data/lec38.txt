Size R eduction (Contd.)  
 
Hello everyone. Welcome to the NPTEL online certification course on Fundamentals of 
Food Process Engineering. So, we will continue with Size Reduction today.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:35)  
 
In our last class, we have discussed the particle size distribution and today will solve 1 or 
2 problem on particle size distribution and also we will see the energy requirement in 
size reduction.  (Refer Slide Time: 00:59)  
 
So, we have seen that , what are the different equivalent diameters  and what are the 
different methods  of particle size analysis. Out of that, which  is the most common we 
often used in food industry or in the lab analysis of the food sample for the particulate 
size distribution. So, we refer the sieve analysis mostly and we h ave mentioned that how 
the sieves are stacked in one another.  There are different standard. Mostl y we follow the 
(Refer Time: 01:24) Tayler standard sieve analysis method by a set o f sieves are ther e. 
The largest openings are at the top and the lowest opening we are getting at the bottom. 
Then, at the bottom end, we are getting a pan and which is just collector. There is no 
perforation in that.  
So, also this all such screens they are categorised that mesh per square inch size for the 
opening per square inch thereby they are defined. So now, the particle size distributio n of 
a sample was measu red and  the data are given . So, we need to calculate different you 
know diameters and the different quantitative parameters of those distribution.  
So, here we will determine the number length mean particle diameter and length v olume 
mean particle diameter. So, the expressions of this are  given in the previous slide. So,  
here we will just apply the equations today . This is the data given the size band in μm 
and number of particles . For the size band  of 0-4 μm number of particles  is 30. Simi larly 
for 4 - 8 μm its 40, for 8 - 12 μm it’s 90 and so on. So, if you look into the distribution, you can see that there is unimodal frequ ency distribution you will get  if you try to draw 
the frequency with respect to the particle size diameter plot. So, that is how it looks like.  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:31)  
 
Now, number length mean particle diameter is expressed by : 
𝑥1,0=  𝑥𝑁 
 𝑁 
Now, length v olume mean particle diameter  is: 
𝑥3,1=   𝑥3𝑁 
  𝑥𝑁  
So, these are the formula. Now, we need to calculate this parameter. We have x that is 
the size we are having in μm. 
Now, if you look into that,  we ha ve we have this size fraction . So, we are taking the 
mean of this size fraction because we need to have one particular size that that we need 
to take as ‘d’ or ‘x’. So, we will always take the mid value or the mean value of this size 
distribution. So, that is why we have taken here 2 , 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30. Now, 
corresponding number of the particles in the earlier class, sometime you may get this ‘x’ 
in terms of ‘d’ and ‘x’ were used to re present the fraction.  So, here since it is used to see the express the diameters, so, I am just mentioning it 
before that you will not confused with that. So, here ‘x’ is the characteristic dimension or 
the equ ivalent dia of the p article that  has been written on the particular sieve size.  
So, 2  μm is having 30 numbers, 6  μm having 40 numbers, 10 μm having 90 numbers and 
so on. So, summation in is the total number of particle that is 540 . We need to use ‘∑xN’ 
here for length mean particl e diameter calculation . Similarly, we got ∑x3N = 3.47×106. 
So, then we need to plot thi s value in the equation. So, number length mean particl e 
diameter is coming as 8660/540. i.e 16.04  μm.  
So, if you go by length mean diameter, so we are getting the mean particle size 
somewhere here between 14 and 16. So, 100 and 120 par ticles there and if this is the 
number of particles are in between somewhere,  the size fraction will come.  If you go by 
length volume mean particle diameter. So, you are getting  
𝑥3,1= 3.47×106
8.66×103=20.02 𝜇𝑚 
 
So, this is the line somewhere the, this side ok. So, we can see that the based on different 
diameter, we are getting slightly different mean size and the number fraction. So,  here 
will get somewhere in between these two . So, this is how we can represent our data.  
(Refer Slide Time: 07:35)  
 Now, fineness modulus again one very important concept  in particular solid analysis. So, 
fineness modulus is an emp irical figure obtained by adding the total percentage of the 
sample of an aggregate retained on each of the specified series of siev e and dividing the 
sum by 100 . Adding the total percentage of the sample of an aggregate retained on each 
of the sieve of  a specified series of sieves and then dividing by 100. That will give the 
value of fineness modulus.  
Fineness modulus indicate the uniformity of grind in the end resultant product. So,  the 
average particle size of D P in mm represented in terms of finenes s modulu s: 
DP=0.135 (1.366)F.M 
So, uniformity is defined by fineness modulus. Now, once we have the value of fineness 
modulus, the average particle size D P can be determined by this equation . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:02)  
 
So, let us have one case analysis for that, we have a sieve number 100, 70, 50, 40, 30, 20 
15 and pan. So,  7 sieves and a pan this is the standard configuration that we are h aving 
for this particular sieve.  Then  weight of the material retained on it in the gram. So, all 
have passed through the 100 number sie ve. So, this is 0, then 1.0 g  retained on 17 
numbe r sieves 16.7 g  retain ed on 15 number sieves 36.7 g  retain ed on 40 number sieves 
82.2 g  retained on 30 number sieves and 96 g retained on 20 and so on finally, in the pan 
we are getting 8.7  g. So, total is 249.7 g. Now, we need to see that from the total how much percentage is this. 
So, first if we go from the bottom pan, we can be considered as 0 and number e ach of the 
consecutive a upper sieves 1 , 2, 3 up to 7.  
Now, in the pan what is retained that is 8.7  g. So, if we calculate the percentage retained 
based on the total sample that is 3.5 %, then the 8  g it will be 3.2 %, 96 g  will be 38.4  %, 
82.2 g is coming 32.88  %. So, like that will calculate all the percentage that is retained 
(Refe r Time: 11:44) . So, total material  that is retain ed on the s ieve that we will count 
here. only those retained on the sieve will take the total based on that and calculate the 
percentage material retained on each sieve, then we will add then. So, it is coming 274.2 
total percent material retained . 
Now, fineness modulus and averag e size will  be 274.2/ 100. So, we are getting 2.74. So, 
if this is the fineness modulus. So, what will be the D P?  
DP=0.135 (1.366)2.74 
So, we are getting 0.315 mm.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:29)  
 
Now, energy requirement. So, since we are increasing the surface area by reduction of 
the size of the particle, in so, in the very beginning section w e were  discussing the 
introduction of size reduction, we mention that our most important goal that is  to 
increase the surface area. Now, increase of surface area involved energy requirement right, because whenever we want to do any sort of w ork, so, we are giving certain 
amount of energy in the particle, initially which is make them strain.  
So, that energy which we are applying that is stored in the particle and when it b reaks 
into smaller particles.  That energy is released in terms  of creating the surface area, and 
also in terms of creating the heat . So, if we want to analyse the energy requirement we 
can calculate first one parameter that is the crushing efficiency which is very often we 
used and it defined as the surface ene rgy created by crushing divided by the energy  
absorbed because of crushing . 
So, the input energy required to reduce the size of the particles solid depends on the 
energy absorbed by the solid, and also there are certain frictional losses will be there a nd 
certain material, which is the equipment or the other rotating part of the machines that 
will absorb certain amount of applied energy. So, because of those frictional losses will 
take also the mechanical efficiency ‘ηm’ into considera tion. 
So, the input energy that will give  will reduce the size of the particle ok depending on the 
energy absorbed for creating the surface and also the mechanical efficiency of the 
process, which takes into account of frictional losses. Now the energ y transferred to the 
materi al is store d in the particle as  I say internal stresses, when the stored energy is 
released because of particle fracture part of it increase surface energy resulting from the 
surface area an d some are released as the heat energy.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:08)  
 So, temperature rise becau se that heat energy is released  that means that will cause the 
temperature rise of the particle that are generated  smaller particles are generated, l arger  
surface area created . The temperature rise may be an important technological iss ue with 
heat sensitive products,  thermoplastic substances and also the material with high fat 
content. So, this problem is address by air or water cooling of the mechanism, usi ng the 
cryogenic such as the liquid nitrogen or cryo milling.  
So, you might have heard that in case of mini spice grinding, this c ryogenics grinding i s 
approach  is being taken because the spices are mostly having very heat sensitive 
components and antioxida nts etc . So, to preserve we need an environment which is very 
chill environment . For sometime pre cooling environment or in the casing we need to 
circulate the liquid nitrogen to reduce the effect of the temperature generation during the 
size reduction.  
So, that total energy can be expressed as  
𝐸=𝐸𝑎
𝜂𝑚=𝑒(𝐴𝑝−𝐴𝑓)
𝜂𝑚∗𝜂𝑐  
So, ‘e’ is the surface energy per  unit area , j/m2. Ap and Af are the surface areas per unit 
mass of the product and feed, respectively, and η c is a crushing efficiency.  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:17)  
 So, energy ‘dE’ required to produce small change ‘dx’ that m eans, the  dimension of the 
material that is  being  reduced to the amount of the ‘dx’ of the unit mass of material can 
be expressed as a power function of the size of the material.  
𝑑𝐸
𝑑𝑥=−𝐶𝑥−𝑚 
So, always it is inverse of the material size becaus e as small we want to perform the size 
of the material larger amount the energy is required.  
So, that is why, it is a normal convention to have the energy required per unit change 
dimension is always proportional to the inverse of some power of the linear dimension of 
the characteristic dimensions.  
So, there are three  different laws of size reduction that is used basically for addressing 
the different size fraction. So, one is the Rittenger’s law. This is based on the assumption 
that the energy  required is proportional to the new surface area produced that is the 
surface area . i.e m =2. 
𝑑𝐸
𝑑𝑥∝ 1
𝑑2 
So, we are getting integration :  
 
Where,  KR is Rittenger’s constant , Xp is the dimension  of the product  and  Xf is the  
dimension of the feed.  
E=KR 1
Xp−1
Xf  (Refer Slide Time: 19:14)  
 
So, another law which is Kick’s law and in this law is based on the assumption that the 
energy input is proportional to the size redu ction ratio or linear dimension. i.e. m=  1.  
𝑑𝐸
𝑑𝑥=−𝐶𝑥−1 
By integrating this, we are getting  
 
Where,  Kk is Kick’s  constant , Xp is the dimension  of the product  and  Xf is the  dimension 
of the feed.  
Last one is the Bond’s equation. Bond proposed that the work input is proportional to the 
square root of the surface volume ratio of the product.  So, here m =3/2 and after 
integration we are getting energy requirement  
 
E=KklnXF
XP 
E=2Kb× 1
 XP−1
 XF   (Refer Slide Time: 20:28)  
 
So, X f and X p are in m. Bond’s constant K b =5W i.  
Wi is the work index and is defined as the energy required to reduce unit mass of a 
material from an infi nite size to a size where 80 % of the material is below 100  μm.  
 
Xf and X p are in mm . 
Rittinger’s equation  tends to apply for fine grinding and Kick’s  law for course grinding 
Bond’s law valid for the intermediate grinding.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:22)  
E=0.3162 Wi× 1
 XP−1
 XF   
So, here we will take one example where Sugar crystals were ground from an  average 
Sauter diameter of 500μm to powder with an average Sauter diameter of 100μm. The net 
energy consumption was 0.5 kWh per ton. What would be the net energy consumption 
for grinding the crystals to 50μm powder: a.) according to Rittinger’s law b.) ac cording 
to Kick’s law.  
So, net energy consumption in the first case is 0.5 kWh per ton  we need to find E 2. Now, 
applying the Rittinger ’s law we can apply this equation  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 22:32)  
 
E=KR 1
Xp−1
Xf   
 
So, from that, we can  get the Rittinger’s constant K R = 62.5 kWh .μm/ton. Now, using 
that we will calculate that what will be the you know energy requirement for Rittinger’s 
law by making the particle to smaller size of  50 μm. So, here we are getting 1.125 
kWh /ton.  
Coming to t he Kick’s law,  
 
 
 
We will stop here and will continue in the next class.  
Thank you.
