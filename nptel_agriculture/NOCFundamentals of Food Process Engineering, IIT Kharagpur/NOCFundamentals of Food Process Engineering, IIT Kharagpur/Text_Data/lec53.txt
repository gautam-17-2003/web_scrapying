Leaching and Extraction  
Hello everyone, welcome to the NPTE L online certification course on Fundamentals of F ood 
Process Engineering.   
Leaching is basically when the solid component comes into contact with  a solvent and a 
particular solute  from the solid is being separated because that sol ute has a particular affinity 
towards the solvent bu t when instead of solid we use 2  liquid phase , 2 liquid phase and 1 
component from 1 liquid will be extracted by the other liquid then we call it extraction or solvent 
extraction . We can separate the particular component without application of heat . So, for h eat 
sensitive material L eaching an d Extraction is very important and it is also important when we 
have very dilute solution of a particular component that we want to separate and in food,  there 
are many applications of Leaching and E xtraction . 
So, both the  method either solid -liquid extraction or liquid -liquid extraction, these 2 are very 
important in food processing . We have seen that green tea extraction , if you want to develop 
green tea from the green tea leaf powder o r granules or if the caffeine, if  the coffee beans are 
used for extraction of the caffeine.  So, all this are application of Leaching and E xtraction is used 
when some let us say some component of the oil or flavor  that we want to separate by utilizing  
some oth er solvent and then we call it E xtraction.  
So, basically for oil we definite ly use that Solvent Extraction T echnique and all these 2 cases we 
need to know few conditions and few parameters.  So, some of them we have discussed in our 
previous two classes;  one is the equilib rium condition be cause these 2  separation techniques are 
actually the molecular transfer techniques , the solute  molecule is moving from 1  phase to the 
other because of the difference in the chemical potential or difference in the concentration.   
So, this molecule transfer will occur unless there equilibrium  will be established.  So, when the 
equilibrium will be established, then  the transfer of the solute from one phase to the other will 
stop. So, that equilibrium for single stage leaching operation was discussed .  In multi stage leaching  similar to single stage operation  it is assume d that the  rate of transfer will 
be same in each phase and eventually the equilibrium will be attained.  So, in this 2 stream when 
the chemical potential of a particular so lute will be similar, th en the equilibrium will be 
achieved. Ideally it is assumed that for a finite period of time the contact between the slurry and 
the solvent is taking place. So, for that we have to make this contact for  a longer time ; for an 
infinitely long time, so that th is equilibrium will be reached. So, in ideal case we may get some 
deviation. So the concentration or the fraction of the sol ute in the slurry and solvent and in the 
extract may be different.  
(Refer Slide Time: 06:44)  
 
In the  problem the phenomenon that h appened in a multi stage , although it is similar to the single 
stage only and it's a counter current flow. So, in a counter current leaching from the one side the 
the crushed bean  (solid mixture ) that is entered  and from the crush ed beans  we want to extrac t 
the soya  oil that we want to extract and there is a solvent that is entering into the multi -stage 
leaching apparatus from the opposite side . 
Oil is to be extracted from soya beans in a counter current, stage contact, extraction 
apparatus, using hexane. I f the initial oil content of the beans is 18%, the final extract 
solution is to contain 40% of oil, and if 90% of the total oil is to be extracted, calculate the 
number of contact stages that are necessary. Assume that the oil is extracted from the 
beans i n the first mixer, that equilibrium is reached in each stage, and that the crushed bean solids in the underflow retain in addition half their weight of solution after each 
settling stage.  
So, if we take total 100 percent material is coming into the system.  So, in the first stage 18  
percent  is the oil so, 82  percent  will be the sol id beans sol id material.  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:56)  
 
 
 So, in the multistage diagram and this is the V n +1 that is th e solvent entering into the nth  stages 
and in a that is the solid material or from which we need to extract a particular component or 
solid or oil that rate is La.  
 
where V a is the solvent or the extract that tha t we are getting from here and L n is the slurry from 
the nth stage.  
 
Similarly, when we do the component  balance in that so, V  n+1 into X  n+1 that is the c oncentration 
of the oil or solute,  the particular component that we want to separate that in the in the solvent 
itself and similarly, xa denote that the component fraction i n the extract that is coming out  from 
the first stage and L a ya so, y a is a fraction of that sol ute component in the fee d stream and y n is 
the fraction of the that  solute component that coming from the nth, coming from the nth  stage 
and from these 2  we can  eliminate V n+1 and then we develop th is equation just taking V n+1 from 
here and then we put in the balance equation.  
 
 
 
So, this is the material balance and overall mass balance or material balance and the component 
balance on the sol ute.

So, this we will use now to solve the problem . So, we can see that V n +1 is the solving entry into 
an nth stage x n+1, the concentration the fraction of that solute in the stream Ln yn is the slurry that 
comes out from the n th stage , X0 or xa we can we can take this as because we have used this 
notation La ya, xa and V a right.  
So, heavier phase, means the feed slurry that entered. So, that is we have assumed same because 
this is the condition given that the rate of transfer will be same in  each stage, right.  
heavier phase ; Ln+1 = Ln = ... La =L 
Similarly, the lighter phase  
lighter phase ; Vn+1 = Vn = ... Va =V 
we have got this applying this to in the previous equation

Overall mass balance:  
100kg raw material  there will be 18% oil, that is 82kg bean solids and 18kg oil. In the final 
underﬂow, 82 kg bean solids will retain 41 kg of solution, the solution will contain 10% of the 
initial oil in the beans, that is, 1.8kg so that there will be (18 - 1.8) = 16.2kg o f oil in the final 
overﬂow,  
Extract contains (16.2 x 60/40) = 24.3kg of solvent  
Total volume of final overflow = 16.2 + 24.3 = 40.5kg  
Total solvent entering = (39.2 + 24.3) = 63.5kg  
Note that the solution passing as overﬂow between the stages is the same w eight as the solvent 
entering the whole system, i.e. 63.5kg  
 
 
 
 
  
Now, note that the solution passing as overflow between the stages is the same weight as the 
solvent entering the whole system. So, the solution passing as the overflow between the stages i s 
the same that has entered  into the system so, that is 63 .5. Now, this we have to see in all the 
stages what is happening.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:51)  
 
Basis: 100kg beans   
Mass in (kg)  
Underflow  
Raw beans = 100  
    Bean solids = 82  
         Oil = 18  
Over flow 
         Solvent = 63.5  
Total = 163.5  
Basis: 100kg beans  
Mass out (kg)  Underflow  
Extracted  beans +solution= 123  
Bean solids = 82;  Oil = 1.8;solvent= 39.2  
Overflow  
         Total extract = 40.5;solvent =24.3  
          oil = 16.2  
Total  = 163.5  
this t otal remain same in stage 1.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:19)  
 
Analysis of stage 1  
Oil concentration in u nderﬂow = product concentration = 0.4.  
It is an equilibrium stage, so oil concentration in underﬂow equals oil concentration in overﬂow. Let X
2 
represent th e concentration of oil in the overﬂow from stage 2 passing in to stage 1. Then oil entering 
stage 1 equals oil leaving stage 1.  
Therefore balance on oil:  
63.5X
2 + 18 = 41 x 0.4 + 40.5 x 0.4; Y
2 = 0.23; X
2 = Y
2 = 0.23  
 
 Analysis of stage 2  
X
2 = Y
2 = 0.23  
Therefore balance on oil:  
41 x 0.4 + 63.5X
3 = 63.5 x 0.23 + 41 x 0.23  
X
3 = 0. 12.  
So, here we can see that , then when in the in 1 stage , the solvent is entering and the extract that 
that is coming out , the overflow that is coming out  that is entering as a solvent in the next and the 
extract that is coming out that is entering as a solvent in in the next 1. So, like that in the first 
stage, which is if you consider the first stage  so, the exit of the second stage is entering the 
overflow of the second stage is entering at  the solvent in the first stage  right and eventually the 
concentration will change in a way.  
So, X1 that we are calculating. So, in the equilibrium stage, this will be same with the Y1. 
Similarly, the X2 that the stage will consider that wil l similar to the Y2 and so on.  So, we  will 
one, one after the other the stage will count.  
 
Analysis of stage 3  
X
3= Y
3 = 0.12  
Therefore balance on oil:  41 x 0.23 + 63.5X
4 = 63.5 x 0.12 + 41 x 0.12; X
4= 0.049  
 (Refer Slide Time: 24:17)  
  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:55)  
 
Analysis of stage 4  
X4 = Y4 = 0.049  
Therefore balance on oil:  
41 x 0.12 + 63.5 X5 = 63.5 x 0.049 + 41 x 0.049,  
X5 = 0.00315.  
The required terminal condition is that the underﬂow from the final nth stage will have less than 
1 .8 kg of oil, that is, that Xn is less than 1 .8/41 = 0.044.  Now, the required  terminal condition is that the under flow from the final nth stage will have less 
than 1. 8 kg of the oil because 90  percent  extraction should be done . So, less than 1. 8 kg now, that 
Xn if we  try to calculate in terms of fraction, so X n is less than how mu ch X  in that the fraction  
we want to calculate that is 1. 8 out of 41 . So, the stream has  41 kg of the solvent in that 1. 8 was 
there.  
So, after fifth stage, we are almost achieved the condit ion that 90  percent  extraction of the oil has 
been done from the sample. So, this is how you can design when you want to set up any 
extraction solvent extraction or for example, you want to have  leaching setup for that you have to 
think about that what is your sample size and what is the flow rate and how much oil content the 
initial sample is having and you want to separate what amount of what amount of or what 
fraction of the oil or solute  you want to separate.  
So based on that you can design that how ma ny stages are required  and also the efficiency 
calculation that is by the Murphy efficiency which based on what is the extraction can be 
achiev ed in the equilibrium condition  and if equilibrium is not achieved, so how far we can have 
that concentr ation and  the ratio of those 2  things we can use for finding the efficiency of each 
stage.

 Mass transfer in leaching operation:  
 
where: A is the area of the solid –liquid interface,  
b is the effective thickness of the liquid film surr ounding the particles,  
c = concentration of the solute in the bulk of the solution at time t,  
cs= concentration of the saturated solution in contact with the particles, M is the mass of solute 
transferred in time t, and  
k’ is the diffusion coefficient.  
So, Cs - C that will work as a driving force , M is the mass of the solid transferred in time t. So 
this is how having a diffusion means the molecular transfer process considering it as a molecular 
transfer process , we can have this equation to find the rate of mass transfer .

 For a batch process in which V , the total volume of solution, is assumed to remain  
    constant, then:  
 
So, dc is the concentration gradient. So, concentration generally expressed in kg / m3 like that and 
there  is m3so ultimately we can get the change in  the mass.  
So, 
 
So this is concentration gradient, the time t taken for the concentration of the solution to rise 
from it  is initial value of C 0 to a value C is found by integra tion on the assumption that both V 
and A remain constant.  
 
𝐝𝐌=𝐕 𝐝𝐜  So, the thickness of the liquid film will remain constant and the interface area , the contact area 
through which the transfer is taking place between the between the so lid material and the liquid 
layer or liquid film  so that will constant. So, from this we can write this equation.  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:38)  
 
 
so, in pure solvent the concentration C0 is initially taken as 0 there is no solute,  trace of the sol ute 
that. So, furth er from this  
 
 
 
So, this is the equation of the of the change of concentration wit h respect to time in case of a 
leaching operation.

Numerical example#3  
In a pilot scale test using a vessel 1 m3 in volume, a solute was leached from an inert solid 
and the water was 75 per cent saturated in 100 s. If, in a full -scale unit, 500 kg of the inert 
solid containing, as before, 28 per cent by mass  of the water -soluble component, is agitated 
with 100 m3 of water, how long will it take for all the solute to dissolve, assuming conditions 
are equivalent to those in the pilot scale vessel? Water is saturated with the solute at a 
concentration of 2.5 kg/ m3. 
 (Refer Slide Time: 34:39)   
 
Solution  
For the pilot -scale vessel:  
c = (2.5 × 75/100) = 1.875 kg/m3  
cs = 2.5 kg/m3, V = 1.0 m3 and t = 10 s  
1.875 = 2.5(1 – e-(kA/1.0b)100)) 
and: kA/b = 0.139 m3/s 
For the full -scale vessel:  
c = (500 × 28/100)/100 = 1.4 0 kg/m3 
cs= 2.5 kg/m3, V = 100 m3 Thus: 1.40 = 2.5(1 - e-0.139t/100) 
t = 591 s (9.9 min)
