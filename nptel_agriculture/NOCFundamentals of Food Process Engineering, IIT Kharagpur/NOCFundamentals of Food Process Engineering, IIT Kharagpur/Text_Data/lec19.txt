Evaporation and Concentration (Contd.)  
 
Hello everyone , welcome to the NPTEL  online certifi cation course on Fundamentals of 
Food Process Engineering . We will continue today with the topic of Evaporation and 
Concentration . In the previous classes  of this particular chapter we have discussed that 
what are the different types of evaporators ? 
And what kind of evaporators is typically used for  what kind of application ; we have 
discussed a bit of that . And also we have discussed  the boiling point elevation  in the last 
class and  single effect evaporator , multiple effect evaporator . And basically what are the 
different way by which we can increase the effectiveness in the evaporator ok . 
So, today we will actually  solve few numerical , we will see how we can calculate the  
heat and mass balance in evaporator and find out steam economy  or effectiveness etc. 
So, let us starts with those topics . 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:45)  
 
So, the first thing we need to know when we start  solving  problem is overall heat transfer 
coefficient . Overall heat transfer coefficient  to give you an understa nding because you might have learn this in your  heat transfer courses  that if there are  multiple or series of 
phases  are there through which heat is being transferred  so, every section  offers cer tain 
resistance to heat transfer . When  we are analyzing  them together , we call them the 
overall heat transfer coefficient . So, overall heat transfer coefficient includes the 
conductive  conduct ivity and also the effect of convective heat transfer . Say for example,  
if you have a s urface  like this which is  actually a metal  that is separating  two steams here 
let us say in one side there is  steam  and the other side maybe water . 
So, in water side the convective heat transfer coefficient will be there  let us  say h o. Then 
heat has to be conducted through this wall where  the conductivity is “k” and in the inner 
side where the water whose  convective  heat transfer coefficient is hi, where heat q is 
being transferred across it . 
So, we will see now how we  take the value of overall heat transfer coefficient  ok. 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:21)  
 
So, the overall resistance to heat transfer is th e sum of  three  resistances in series  namely 
that of the condensing steam film , that of the s olid wall  and that of the boiling liquid . 
Because in evaporator we have  that from the very  starting of discussion related to 
evaporator ; that there is if we  can take this kind of an evaporat or, where  steam is  coming 
and steam  is getting condensed  and feed which is coming into the evaporator . So, there it is being boi led and the concentrate is coming out from the  bottom, vapour  is 
going out from the top . So, the steam which is coming  is condensing over a surface . We 
have seen that  there are may be  short tube evaporator s or vertical long tube evaporator s 
or simply  jacketed kind of open pan evaporator . 
In any kind of evap orator the steam condense s in one side  of a surface  and the liquid that 
is being evaporated and subsequently con centrate  solution will be prepared . So,  that is 
why in series we have t o take the condensing steam film  and the resistance  of the solid 
wall and that of the boiling liquid . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:31 ) 
 
So w e can write in th is way : 
1
𝑈=1
ℎ𝑠+𝐿
𝑘+1
ℎ𝑏 
Where , U is the ov erall heat transfer coefficient, h s is the convective heat transfer 
coeff icient in the st eam sid e, L is the  thickness of the  surface or thickness of the wall, k 
is the thermal conductivity of the ma terial  and h b is the convective heat transfer 
coefficient of the boil ing liquid . 
So, this is how we can calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient and ultimate ly we 
know that in the heat trans fer we might have read this term  “q”. The total heat transfer is 
given by:                                                          q=U A ΔT  where A is the  area surface area of evaporator , U is this overall heat transfer coefficient  
and ΔT is the t emperature difference that is  you know  across which the heat transfer is 
happening or occurring . 
So, this is basically the difference between the steam that is conde nsing and the liquid 
that is boiling . So, that two temperature difference is designated by  ΔT. 
(Refer Slide Time: 08:34)  
 
So, the heat transfer coeff icient o f condensing steam in shell side  is normally very high 
compared to the liquid side . We can check this like when the st eam is entering steam is 
coming at a temperature , let us say  TS generally we use saturated stea m or  somet ime 
superheated steam mostly we use saturated steam . So, we will  measure  the latent heat of 
condensation at that  saturation temperature . 
So, we have seen that the heat t ransfer coefficient that is ‘hS’ of the condensing steam  is 
normally very  high compared to ‘hb’ which is the convective heat transfer coefficient in 
the boiling l iquid side . The resistance of the scale on the liquid side and the liquid film 
coefficient which is usually inside the tube ; now what is this  Resistance of the scale ? 
Now since we are using  evaporators to concentrate the  dilute soluti on. So, some time 
what happen  that th ese dilute  solution s when they  become concentrated , deposition of 
the solid material  in the form of scale  happens on the surface where  the heat tran sfer 
occurs . So, because of that  there is resistance generate unless we clean them properly time to time . So, that will offer a resistance  in the in the  liquid side of the system of the 
evaporator . So, because o f scale deposition  again the heat transfer will reduce . 
(Refer Slide Time: 10:44)  
 
So, we will see now that  few typical values of overall heat transfer coefficient . You will 
get them in  the books also . If we consider  long tube  vertical evaporator the, their natural 
circulation  that is the liquid which is coming by natural gravitational flow we are not 
using any pump over there . In that case the overall heat transfer coefficient is 1000  to 
2700 W/m2°C. And for long tube vertical evaporators with forced circulation , then the 
overall heat transfer coefficient will vary from  2000 to 7500 W/m2°C. 
If we use short tube vertical evaporators , overall heat transfer coefficient  is 750 to 2500 
W/m2°C. If we use agitated  film evaporators with low to medium viscosity liquid 
(viscosity <1 poise ) then overall heat transfer coefficient can be used in between this 
range that is 1800 to 2700 W/m2°C. And for high viscous , high viscous solutio n we will 
use 1500 W/m2°C. So, because it is obvious that in  case of high viscous sample ; it is very  
you know  difficult to transfer heat  even if we  employ  agitation in between  them to 
increase the heat transfer coefficient .  
Falling film evaporator  where viscosity < 0.1 poise  overall heat transfer coefficient  is 
500 to 2500 W/m2°C. And for rising film evaporator s; the overall heat transfer 
coefficient values vary from  2000 to 5000 W/m2°C. So, based on the requirement like when we use very heat  sensitive  liquid fruit juices etc . 
So, that time we  use the short tube  evaporator s. When  our product  is not heat sensitive  
then we can use long tube  vertical evaporator . So, based  on our requirement we can 
choose the different kind of evaporators . 
(Refer Slide Time: 13:57 ) 
 
Now  coming to the design of single effect evaporator . So, let us see first the mechanism  
that will happen in a single effect evaporator . So, in a single effect evaporator ; that 
means, only one evaporator effect or chamber is there  in that steam is entering . 
So, steam  is entering at temperature  TS and having the enthalpy HS and this steam will 
condense here  inside the evaporator and t he condensate which is coming out  at a 
temperature  TS and having the enthalpy  HCS; whereas the feed which is entering at  TF 
temperature . Water  will be evapo rated from here and concentrated juice will come out 
from the bottom . So, that feed will separate int o two streams ; one is the concentrate and 
another is the vapor  that is coming out . 
This single effect will operate at a constant pressure  PV and based on this  constant  
pressure  PV. The saturation temperature or boiling point that we can se e from the steam 
table . So, from this  steam table which is the  actually the  property tab le for the saturate d 
water vapo r. We can see this value of temperature  TV corresponding to pressure  PV. Now ‘F’ which is mass flow r ate of the feed i n kg/s,  ‘V’ which is the  mass flow rate of 
the vapor  in kg/s, ‘L’ which is the mass flow rate of the concent rate which is coming out 
from the evaporator  in kg/s. and we have  ‘S’ which is the flow rate of the steam in kg/s. 
So, we can observe that the steam that is entered s ame amount of the steam is coming 
out. Only  the latent heat of condensation is being provided  across the heat transfer 
surface in the single effect evaporator . And that heat is being taken by this feed and 
vapor  ‘V’ kg/s is coming out and even tually the  remaining heat is with concentrate . So, 
the concentration  XF concen tration of the solid in the fee d was definitely lower than the 
concentration of solid in the  concentrate that is coming . 
XF, XL = fraction of solids in the feed & concentrate  
TF, TS= temperature of feed & steam entering, oC 
Tb = boiling point temperature = T V + boiling point raise   (T V = T b, if there is no b.p.r )  
TV = saturation temperature at P V  
PV = operating pressure of evaporator   
PS = pressure of entering steam  
 (Refer Slide Time: 18:53 ) 
 
Now as  I said in the previous slide that there  will be a temperature  ‘TV’ that will be 
corresponding to the vapor  pressure  prevail ing in the evaporator chamber  that is  ‘PV’. 
Now we have learned then there may be boiling point  elevation because of increase in  
the concentration of the solid in the  solution . So, now  we will see that what will happe n if there is boiling point raise  in the  chamb er in the  in the solution . So, what  will happen ? 
Tb = boiling point temperature = T V + boiling point raise   (T V = T b, if there is no b.p.r ).  
So, then before solving this we will assume there will be no heat  loss. That means, 
whatever heat the steam is supplying  is condensing . The total heat will be utilized by the 
solution that is the feed  to be evaporate and to become concentrated.  So, there is no heat 
loss. 
And also we can consider t hat if  the feed that is entering in the effect is close to the 
saturation  temperature or  the boilin g point temperature corresponding to the pressure that 
is inside the evaporator . So, we can consider the sensib le heat requirement as negligible . 
Now  since we have considered that steam  losses it  is latent heat only and first we will  
look into the mate rial balance that is  ‘F’ the feed  which will be  giving us  two streams 
namely  steam vapor  and concentrated liquid .               
Material balance:  F = V+L  
Solid balance:  F.X F = L.X L 
Now making the energy balance or heat balance :  
Total  heat that has entered will be equal to total heat that has come out . 
Heat content in (Feed + steam) = Heat content in (Concentrate+ Vapor + condensate)  
F.H F + S. H S = L.H L + V.H V + S.H CS 
 (Refer Slide Time: 22:50)  
 
So, we can again take steam in this side : S (H S - HCS) = L.H L + V.H V - F.H F    Heat transfer in evaporator = q = S (H S - HCS) = S λ  
Now this is the  this is the  heat that is being transferred in the evaporator and it is 
transferred through the area “A” in that again the series  system , one side there is steam  
and the other side there is boiling liquid fine . So, we have  calculated the overall heat 
transfer coefficient  ‘U’ i.e. UA(T S-Tb) 
So, Heat  transfer in evaporator = q = S (H S - HCS) = S λ = UA(T S-Tb)  
Calculating  this ‘A’, we can find out  what will be the area requirement of the eva porator ; 
that means  the size of the evaporator . 
(Refer Slide Time: 26:12)  
 
Where, U= overall heat transfer coefficient                 A= area of heat exchanger  
             λs= latent heat of vaporization at T S 
HF = enthalpy of feed = c F (TF- 0oC) 
HL = enthalpy of c oncentrate = c L (Tb- 0oC) 
cF, cL= specific heat of feed & concentrate (for dilute solution its value is = 4.18 kJ/kgoc) 
HS, Hcs , HV are determined by using steam table (if not given in problem)  
HS = enthalpy of saturated steam (in steam table: enthalpy of saturated vapor at T S or P S)  
Hcs = enthalpy of condensate steam (in steam table: enthalpy of saturated liquid at T S or 
PS) 
HV = enthalpy of vapor (in steam table: enthalpy of saturated vapor at T b ) Now how we can calcu late enthalpy of the feed ? We need  to know another  property that 
is specific heat.  Specific  heat that is the heat required for per unit mass of the product t o 
increase the temperature by 1°C. So, HF = enthalpy of feed = c F (TF- 0oC) 
 (Refer Slide Time: 27:34)  
 
 
Similarly we can calculate enthal py of concentrate : HL = c L (Tb- 0oC) 
Concentration  ratio (R) that means  how much we have concentrated fro m the initial 
concentration . R=X L/XF. Now steam economy that is how much steam we have  utilized  
and what amount of steam we have generated ok ; that means, we have evaporated that 
much water from the liquid . So, economy  or effectiveness we always calculate based on 
what we are getting divided by what we have given to the system or wh at is the input to 
the system . The steam economy of the evaporator  is given by  
steam  economy =vapor
steam  rate 
 (Refer Slide Time: 29:35)  
 
Let’s  see one example: So, this is our  XL, this is our  XF the specific heat of the feed and 
the concentrate is  3.9 and 2.3 kJ/kg°C  respectively.  The steam pressure is measured to be  
304.42 kPa. We will refer  steam table to identify what will be the  Tb or saturation  vapor  
saturation temperature at this pressure . The inlet  feed temp erature is  43.3 °C this is our  
TF, the p roduct inside the evaporator boils at  62.2 °C.  So, this will be our  Tb. So, steam 
pressure is  given  so TS is not given . Overall  heat transfer  coefficient is assumed to be  U 
= 943 W/m2°C. Assume  negligible boiling point elevation . Calculate  the mass flow rate 
of concentrated product and steam requirement . So, we need to calculate  L, S, steam  
economy and  heat transfer area . (Refer Slide Time: 32 :25) 
 
Pressure  of the steam is  given  so from the steam table we will find out  what is the 
saturation temperature  TS. Tb is given  i.e. inside the  evaporator what is the temperature . 
Boiling  temperature  U is given also . We need to know to find the  ‘L’ that is the  mass 
flow rate of the concentrate .   F.X F = L.X L  
Because feed is given to us  XF and XL that is the concen tration of the solid in the feed  
and the concentrate is given . So, we can calculat e L first; so L is coming  0.098 kg/s. So, 
what will be  ‘V’ then? We know that  V = F - L; so, that is  0.57 kg/s. 
Then coming t o the energy balance or heat balance :        Sλ = L.H L + V.H V - F.H F    
So, all the mass flow rate  multiplied with their respective enthalpies . So, HF will be 
what ? We know that HF = c F (TF- 0oC).  So it is coming around  168.9 kJ/kg . 
Similar ly we will calculate HL, HL = c L (Tb- 0oC) = 2.3 (62.2 – 0) = 143.1 kJ/kg  
So, we know  F, we have calculated HF, we know  V and we know  L and HL right , we also 
know  this HV from th e steam table . we can get this one from the steam table . So, putting  
all the values here because this is coming from the latent heat of condensation and this is 
coming because vapor  is generated at a  temperature of  Tb. So, what is the  enthalpy at the 
temperature , we can get from the steam table . (Refer Slide Time: 35:30)  
 
So, HS is the enthalpy of saturated  vapor at 134 °C that is  2725.9. Enthalpy  of the 
saturated liquid we are getting HV is the enthalpy of saturated vapor  at 62.2 °C i.e. T b. 
And also p utting all this value we can calcu late the value of  S that is  0.64 kg/s. 
So, steam economy will be  what ? The vapor that is evaporated is  0.57 kg/s and the steam 
that is being used is  0.64.  So, steam economy is  0.85 ok. So, we can see that  since it  is a 
single effect evaporator , we can not get economy higher than 1. However , if we use 
multiple effect evaporator , that means  the same vapor  if we used to evaporate  liquid from 
the concentrated solution in the next effect and eventually in the third effect as well.  So, 
the vapor that is the water evaporated  from the liquid from the same amount of steam 
utilization will increase . Therefore, steam economy for the multiple effe ct will be always 
greater than 1. 
Now area of the  heat exchanger will b e so, we know that the equation t hat we have seen 
q =q×S = UAΔT. So, here the  ΔT = T s -Tb. And here rate of ma ss flow rate of steam is  
0.64 kg/s and this is the  value of HS minus HCS,  so we are getting the area as  20.4 m2. (Refer Slide Time: 37:55)  
 
So we will stop here ; we will continue  in the  next class .
