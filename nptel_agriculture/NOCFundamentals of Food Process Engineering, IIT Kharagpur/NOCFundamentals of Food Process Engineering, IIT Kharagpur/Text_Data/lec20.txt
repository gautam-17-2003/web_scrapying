Evaporation and Concentration (Contd.)  
 
Hello everyone , welcome to NPTEL  online certificati on course on Fundamentals of 
Food Process Engineering . We will continue today with the topic evaporation and 
concentration . So, in the last class we have  seen that how we can design the single effect 
evaporator and we can calculate the  steam economy and he at transfer area or heat 
exchanger area .  
Today  we will continue  with the design of  multiple effect evaporator also , but before 
going into that  we will just look  into a few cases , where evaporator is used effectively . 
So, first is the biological material . Which is very heat sensitive material and for them we 
use often evaporator to make them concentrated for example, milk, fruit juices, etc.  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:15)  
 
So, these materials they contain fin e particles and  suspended matter in the solution  and 
what happen that  during evaporation sometime these material can be deposited in the 
surface of the liquid side . And if they are not clean ed properly then maybe bacterial 
growth can generate  and the contamination will be high so the equipment  the evaporato r 
should be design ed in such a way proper cleaning  can be done .  So, all this biological material  that we are talking about , they exhibit a small boiling 
point rise when concentrated  because they have the suspended solids in the fin ely 
dispersed form or ha ve the large molecules that are  you know  dissolve d. So, they 
generally  provide a very less  rise in the boiling point because their nature is not like  
sodium hydroxide solution  or NaCl solution .  
(Refer Slide Time: 02:50)  
 
So, the amount of degradation  of biological material during evaporation that is basically 
a function of temperature and length of the time . 
So, we have to  design in such a way  so that th e heat sensitive material does  not expose  to 
the temperature for a  longer time . So, we will design  or we will take the heat transfer 
area a smaller one  so, that way we can  design . And another thing we can operate the 
evaporator chamber under vacuum  so that the boiling point will  come down . So, another 
one case  is we can operate under vacuum , another  is we c an keep the time of contact 
low. So, we can see few equipments that are  used for a biological material one is long 
tube vertical evaporator that is specifically used for the condensed milk . 
So, the reason is when we use this  long tube vertical evaporator s. They  become 
concentrated as they come down they will become concentrated . So, heat transfer will be  
difficult . So, and because there , because their high viscosit y mobility is also a problem , 
that is why we use the long tube vertical evaporator for them .  Then there is falling film evaporator , these are  mostly used for the fruit juices . Agitated  
film evaporator those are used for antibiotics , fruit juices and gelatin also  because all 
these cases we need a continuous agitation  to increase the heat transfer  because towards 
the end of  evaporation as they  become concentrated  they may stick to the surface and  
reduce the heat transfer coefficient .  
There is also heat pump  cycle evaporator for fruit juice milk and pharmaceutical  because 
these a re very heat sensitiv e materials . Natural circula tion type short tube evaporator  
these are used for sugar solution .  
(Refer Slide Time: 05:35)  
 
Now,  we will discuss the design of multiple effect evaporator , let us first see the 
configuration of multiple effect evaporator . So,  here we  are considering three effects , 
triple effect evaporator and  here this is forward feed evaporator  i.e. forward feed triple 
effect evaporator . 
So, this is the first effect  ok, this is the second one and this is  the third effect . So, we can 
observe t hat first , in the first effect feed is entering the mass flow rate  of the feed is 
 , 
xf is the concentration of solid in the feed stream T f is the temperature of feed that is 
entering in the first e ffect.  
So, in the first effect temperature is  T1 this is the  saturation vapor  temperature or boiling 
tempera ture at the pressure , let us say if the pressure is  P1 in the first effect  and here one side of the heat exchange  surface  this feed is there  and the other side there is  steam . So, 
this is the h eat transfer area across which this heat transfer is taking place , where the 
overall heat transfer coefficient including the steam  side and the material or the 
conductive material or the surface  through which this you know heat transfer heat 
exchange is taking place .  
So, the conductivity of that material and the convective heat transfer in the liquid side . 
So, together we have calculated this U1 and 
  is the mass  flow rate of the steam that is 
entering at a temperature Ts. Now, this steam  is co ndensed here  going out by this stream 
and whatever evaporation takes place in the first effect that is causing this vapour  flow 
rate 
  from the first effect and that is coming out from the first effect entering into the 
second one .  
Where as, the concentrated f eed or concentrated liquid that is coming out by the 
evaporation of feed that is going to enter to th e next effect . So, what is happening in the 
next effect as  we have discuss , that the pressure in the first effect is higher than that is in  
the second one and eventually the second one the pressure is higher than the third  one. 
So, to the high pressure side , from the high pressure to the low pressure we are sending 
the feed. So, no requirement of  pump is there  so feed is going from first to t he second 
effect and again from the  concentrated liquid which is coming from the second effect is 
going to enter into the third one . From the third we a re finally, getting the product  which 
is very high in the concentration of the solid that is x p and comi ng out at a temperature  
T3.  
So, T3 is the  temperature that is  with respect to the pressure P3 in the chamber and again  
T2 is th e temperature which is prevailing in the second effect corresponding to the 
pressure P 2. 
  is the vapour  that is gen erated in the second effect and that is utilised in 
the third effect for heat exchange with the  input stream or input feed which is entering 
from the second effect to the third one , this vapour  which is generated in the third  effect 
finally, goes to the co ndenser . 
So, this is the  total system  so eventually this x f which is the concentration of solid in the 
feed will be concentrated in the x f1, further concentrated in x f2 and we are getting product  xp that is highly concentrated . So, utilising the same steam  
we are now generating 
vapour 
 , 
  and 
 .  
So, we can see that how we are increasing the steam economy as well and in more  
general cases we consider that these  three effects are equal in size  i.e. heat trans fer area 
available are same . And that is in most of the cases a design criteria  for the iteration that 
we perform  that when this area  are almost close to each other or wit hin a variation of 10 
% we shall stop further  iteration . 
So, that will be our final d esign of the  multiple effect evaporator . Now, let us see how we 
can step by step perform the overall balance , solid balance , enthalpy balance and finally, 
design the  system . 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:05)  
 
So, there are fe w design steps we will follow them one  by one , first is use the  overall 
component balance to completely determine the feeds  and product streams , the se 
numbers are fixed and are not changed  by iteration .  obviously, numbers will be fixed of 
the in feed and the product streams  because you know t he number of effect that you are 
going to design , if it is a three effect system . So, one feed stream is entering , one 
concentrate from the first , another from the second and lastly  from the third . 
So, three  concentrated streams are coming  out and similarl y the vapour V1, V 2 and V3. 
So, those are not going to change through the whole  system , I mean their number does  not change  but value may change  as you perform iteration one  after the  other . So, 
calculate the total amount of vapor vaporiz ed.  
Vtotal =V 1+V 2+V 3 
Normally  we consider that equal amount of vapor  is generated . i.e.  V1=V 2=V 3. Then use 
component and material balance to get estimates for the remaining flow rates within the 
system and the composition of the intermediate streams .  
So, what we are doin g in the third step that is component and material  balance to get 
estimate from the remaining flow rates within the system and the composition of the 
intermediate stream . That means, we need to know the  fraction of the solid in the  streams 
that is coming o ut and that can be done by the component balance and  the overall  
material balance .  
And once we get the concentration we know that concentration has a relation with 
boiling point rise. Although  the biological material we have seen that  they does not 
provid e very high boiling point rise . But to identify  how much amount of elevation is 
there or to understand how a boiling point elevation  effect  the operation  in a multiple 
effect evaporator  we will solve . Now including boiling point rise  however, small the 
value maybe because that will help you in  designing a system where actually there exist 
a, significant amount of boiling point elevation right . 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:23)  
 So, from the known outlet concentration and pressure in the last effect , determine the 
boiling point in the last effect then determine the overall temperature drop between the 
steam and the saturation temperature of the last effect . The overall temperature drop 
between the steam and the saturation temperature of the last effect  
∆𝑇𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒=𝑇𝑠−𝑇3− 𝐵𝑃𝑅 
 So, if you want to understand that how this is generating. So, we know that T s is the 
temperature of the steam that is entering in the first effect. Now, the boiling point in the 
first effect corresponding to let us say  pressure P 1 is T 1. So in the first effect we are 
getting this much ΔT i.e. ( Ts - T1). The vapor is coming out at this  T1 temperature  and 
that is going to enter in to the second effect as steam . 
So, in the second effect we are getting T1 - T2 where  T2 is the boiling point temperat ure 
corresponding to pressure P 2 in the seco nd effect now this vapor that is coming out at  T2 
will enter into the third effect . So, in the third effect we are finally getting, T2 -T3 that is 
we are getting Ts - T3 when there is no boiling point elevation.  Now, if boiling point 
elevation happens or i t occurs then in the first e ffect, in the first effect what will be the 
concentration because of that some boiling point elevation will be there, similarly; in the 
third effect as well and  in the fourth effect as well . 
So, when  T1 comes out it includes tha t boiling point elevation, but when it enters in the  
next effect . So, in the next effect the effect of that elevation is not there. So, that we 
cannot consider there, that that is why what we do? That the total difference will be total 
ΔT that we can get w hen the boiling point rise exist will be   
ΔT = T s - T3 – (BPR 1+BPR 2+BPR 3) 
∆𝑇𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒=𝑇𝑠−𝑇3− 𝐵𝑃𝑅 
So, this is how we  can calculate the total Δ T available.   (Refer Slide Time: 20:06)  
 
 (Refer Slide Time: 20:18)  
 
Then allocate the overall drop amo ng the various effects since the areas are the same . So, 
we will consider that all the areas of the three effects  will be same . So, the temperature 
difference in each effect is roughly , inversely proportional to the overall transfer 
coefficients .  
 U1ΔT1= U2ΔT2= U3ΔT3 
Where, U 1, U 2 and U 3 are overall transfer coefficients of 1st, 2nd and 3rd effect . ΔT1, ΔT2 
and ΔT3 are the temperature difference in all the three effect respectively . So, definitely since the temperature of steam that is  being entered and th e pressure that is 
inside the chamber all are different . So, U1, U 2, U 3 will be different . However , the 
temperature difference in each effect is roughly inversely proportional to the overall 
transfer coefficient . So, that means, we can write here  
∆𝑇1= ∆𝑇 1𝑈1 
1
𝑈1+1
𝑈2+1
𝑈3 
So, use the ΔT and boiling point rise values to obtain estimate of all the temperatures in 
the system and we can start with the steam entering in the first effect, right. So, if you 
think about that how we can derive this you can calculate like this that, if we identi fy the 
total effect that is actually you know because this is equal amount of heat transfer is 
taking place where in all the effect . So, what we can write: q = UA Δ T. 
So, here we can write that, q = U 1A1(Ts1 -T1).   I can write (Ts1 -T1) = q/(U 1A1).  
Simil arly, T1 –T2) = q/(U 2A2).  
T2 –T3 = q/(U 3A3). 
So, if we add now all these equation all the three equation. So, we are getting  
q = ( Ts1 -T1) U1A1 = q (1/U 1+1/U 2+1/U 3)/A 
ΔT U = 1/U 1+1/U 2+1/U 3  
 (Refer Slide Time: 27:45)   
So, if there is boiling point eleva tion exist so we can calculate this  
          T1= Ts 1 – ΔT1 
          T2= T 1 – BPR 1– ΔT2                                                               Ts2 = T 1-BPR 1 
          T3= T 2 – BPR 2– ΔT3                                                               Ts3 = T 2-BPR 2 
T1, T2, T3 these are the saturation temperature for the effect 1, 2, 3 and T s1, Ts2 and Ts3 
are the temperature of condensate leaving the effect 1, 2 and 3 . 
(Refer Slide Time: 30:02)  
 Now, solve the set of equation that is made up of one ent halpy balance for each effect ok , 
then check whether the  V1, V 2, V 3 are close to each other and then  we can have the new 
values if they are not each other the iteration will goes on .  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:24)  
 
Finally, will solve for heat transfer rate a nd area in each effect  
                                      q1=Sλs 1                        A1=q1/(U 1ΔT1) 
                                      q2=Sλs 2                        A2=q2/(U 2ΔT2) 
                                      q3=Sλs 3                        A3=q3/(U 3ΔT3) 
Compare the areas. If they are not equal, you need to repeat the calculation. Begin by 
using the areas you obtained to revise the temperature estimates. The recommended 
approach is to use the ratio of the calculated heat transfer area for a n effect to the 
arithmetic mean of the calculated areas.  
∆𝑇1 𝑛𝑒𝑤=∆𝑇 𝐴1
𝐴𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛  
Similarly  we will calculate ΔT 2 and ΔT 3 because , see ΔT 1 surface area  will be 
proportional to heat transfer , I mean if the area is higher . So, higher amount of heat 
transfer will be there and since we have  we can calculate that the ΔT 1 in that is the 
change of temperature in the first effect proportional to the area .  Finally , Capacity of multiple effect evaporators:  q = q 1+q2+q3 
 (Refer Slide Time: 31:55)  
 
So, just q uickly  I will discuss problem that is a triple effect forward feed evaporator is 
being used to evaporate sugar solution having 10 % wt solids to a concentrated solid of 
50 %. Boiling point rise is governed by this equation  BPR, °C=1.78x+6.22x2, where x is 
the weight fraction of the sugar in the solution . Saturated steam at 205.5  kPa is entered in 
the first effect . Pressure in the vapour space of third effect is given that is 13.4 kPa that 
means, corresponding to this we can calculate the temperature in the  third effect . Feed 
rate is given , temperature is given , cp is again by concentration equation is given and  U1, 
U2 and U3 is given . So, if the each effect has the same surface area , calculate the area  and 
the steam used , and the steam economy . (Refer Slide Time: 33:06)  
 
So, steps will be this way , first is pressure temperature in the last effect because the 
pressure is given . So, the temperature correspondingly we can calculate , overall balance 
to find the vap our and liquid content . So, then solid balance t o find the concentration in 
each effect from the concentration we can calculate boiling point rise and temperature 
drop. Finally, calculate the specific heat and from that enthalpy , from the heat balance 
we can find out actual V, S and L and check with wha t we have assume . Then calculate 
the total heat transfer area of the evaporator and if you are getting within 10% variation 
we will stop otherwise the iteration will continue . 
(Refer Slide Time: 33:58)  
 So, first, in 13.4 kPa saturation temperature we hav e calculated . So, this saturation 
temperature from the steam table is coming 51.67  °C. Now, equation for the boiling point 
rise in the effect 3 where the concentration of weight fraction given is 0.5. So, we will 
find the boiling poin t rise in the third ef fect using that concentration formula . we are 
getting now  T3. 
Then  we are making an overall balance of total feed : F= L 3 + V1 + V 2+ V3.  So, by doing 
the balance  of the solid concentration we are getting , what is the amount  of L3, right . 
F×X F = L 3 ×0.5 + (V1 + V 2+ V3) ×0.  
We will get L 3 here. Putting  into L3 we are calculating V by taking equal V in all the 
cases . So, we are getting 6048  kg/h here . 
(Refer Slide Time: 35:24)  
 
So, third effect we have  calculated this L3 and this  is a forward feed evaporator . So we 
need to calculate TS3, TS2 and T S1, we have calculated  T3, now we will calculate  T2 and 
T1 how because we need to identify the boiling point elevation in all the effect . (Refer Slide Time: 35:53)  
 
So, we will first calculate , what is L1 and do the  balance on L1. 
So, L1+ V 1 = 6048 + L 1  
Now  again  using that L 1 value , L1 = V 1+L2. So, we will calculate L2 and then again using 
L2 this will be L1 and this will be L2, so using that we can calculate . So, this is V3 and L 3, 
we can calculate L3. L3 = 4536  kg/h. 
Now, making a solid balance on the effect 1, 2 and 3 and solving for X.   We will 
calculate ‘X’. So,  in the first effect 22680  ×0.1 = L 1×X 1 = 16632  ×X 1. So, X1 = 0.136 . 
Similarly, X2 is 0.214  and X3 is 0.500 . 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:10)   
Use in this equation to find the boiling point rise in each effect  1, 2 and 3. 
BPR, °C=1.78x+6.22x2 
Finally , ΔTavailable  = T s1 - T3. 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:34)  
 
So, then we know that temperature  difference in the first effect will be : 
∆𝑇1= ∆𝑇 1𝑈1 
1
𝑈1+1
𝑈2+1
𝑈3 
 Similarly ΔT 1, ΔT2 and ΔT 3 will calculate . So, calculate the boiling point of the solution  in each effect  so T1= Ts1 - ΔT 1 because Ts1 
at which the liquid has condensate because of the  because of the boiling point elevation . 
So, T1= Ts1 - ΔT1 = 121.1 - 15.56  = 105.54 . 
Now, how we have calculated here 15.56 . However, we have considered this after first  
trial that the temperature higher amount of  you know difference we are getting in the first 
effect . So, that is why we have increased this a bit propor tionately and reduce the other 
temperature drop in t he ΔT2 and ΔT 3.  
So, here T1 is 105.54,  similarly  we have calculated  T2. T2 = T 1 – BPR - ΔT2 and that we 
are getting 86.84 . So, T2 is 86.84  and Ts2 will be that is the condensate from the second 
effect will be T1. That means, what is entered minus BPR 1. So, that we are getting 
105.18 . 
(Refer Slide Time: 39:37)  
 
Similarly, for the third effect we have calculated that  T2 - ΔT3 that is the difference in the 
third effect . So, T3we are getting 54.12  so T3 that will be that 86.84 - (BPR) 86.19 . 
The temperature in th e three effect,  now we have calculated . So, Ts1 that the steam has 
entered  T1 that vapour that has gone to the next effect as Ts2. So, it has been reduced 
because the boiling point elevation has been  deducted then  T2, the effect temperature in 
the in the s econd one that is going as  T3 , again boiling point rise has been removed from 
this value and similarly for the third one .  (Refer Slide Time: 40:34)  
 
So, heat capacity again formula is given . So, all the heat capacity we will calculate and 
will use that  0 °C as datum temperature . 
(Refer Slide Time: 40:46)  
 
To make a ll the heat balance in the first effect , second effect and third effect . So, in the 
first effect  
H1 = H s2 (saturation enthalpy at Ts2) + 1.884  ×BPR . So, H 1 we have calculated . So, λS1= Hs1 (vapour saturation enthalpy ) - Hs1 (liquid 
enthalpy ). Effect 2 we are getting 86.84  that is  T2, Ts3 is 86.19 , boiling point rise is 0.65. 
So, H2 = H s3 +1.884  ×0.65.  
So, that is H2 the steam that is  entering  λs2 that we have calculated in the second effect . 
So, like this  heat transfer in all such effects we have calculated .  
(Refer Slide Time: 42:02)  
 
And using that  enthalpy finally, we can calculate that V1, V 2, V 3 that all the effect what 
we are getting right . 
So, this way doing the overall balance , solid b alance and enthalpy balance . (Refer Slide Time: 42:25)  
 
We can calculate the  total vapour that is generated and also calculate the total heat 
transfer area . So, once we got all the values of steam  we can calculate the q 1, q2, q3 that is 
the heat tr ansfer and find out the area A1, A 2, A 3. So, if the area are almost equal within 
the 10 % variation our iteration stops here , so. 
Thank you . We will stop here .
