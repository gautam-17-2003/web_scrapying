Thermal Processing and Kinetics of Microbial Death (  Contd.  ) 
 
Hello everyone , welcome to NPTEL  online certification course on Fundamentals of 
Food Process E ngineering . Today we will continue our 14th lecture that is the 
continuatio n of our third chapter that is Thermal P rocessing and Kinetics of Microbial 
Death. So, in the last class we have  discuss about the various thermal processing that is 
being done for preservation of food such as blanching , pasteurization and sterilization . 
Today we will focus on the microbial death kinetics during thermal  processing . 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:02)  
 
We know that normally any reaction whether it is  physical , chemical or microbiological 
reaction it  is very convenient to identify the pattern of change of concentration with time 
or temperature . Basically , this condition of microbial  count with time at various 
temperatures  is termed as kinetics of microbial death and  we have seen that the kinetics 
of microbial death follows a definite pattern like , we have seen that the chemical reaction  
generally categoriz ed into  zero order reaction o r first order reaction and  so on. So, 
although the  zero order reaction is not much  common in  food processing phenomena , 
very less cases we are  getting based on the zero order kinetics . However , the first order kinetics is  very common  nutrient degra dation follow s this first 
order kinetics and  so, is in case of the microbial  destruction . Now when a suspension of 
microorganism is heated at constant temperature the decrease in  number of viable 
organism follows first order reaction . That means, the nutri tional loss  during thermal 
processing , which is also treated as first order reaction has the nature like this . That rate 
of degradation or rate of number of viable microorganism  with respect to time will be 
proportional  to the number of viable count s. 
So, if we elaborate the case for thermal destruction of microorganism , let N is the 
number of viable organism , k is the first order rate constant for  microbial inactivation , 
then we can write.  
dN
dt=−kN 
The minus sign showing that number of microorganism will be decrease with time . Now 
integrate above equation:  when t=0 N=N 0 and t=t then N=N

Log e (N/N 0) = -kt 
If you want remove that –ve sign. Then               Log e (N0/N) = kt  Now if we plot these survivors  in y axis and time in the x axis . So, we can get a n 
exponentially decay  kind of  curve . And if you plot microbial viable microbial  count in 
the log scale with respect to time , then we can get a straight line . And the slope of this 
straight li ne will give us the value of ‘k’ that is the first order r eaction rate kinetics 
constant . So, this curve is known as the survivor curve that is log of viable micro 
organism count with respect to time . 
Now, if you want to see the effect of this , the gradient of survivor curve increases 
markedly with temperature ; that means, if we increase the temperature the microbial 
count will decrease . So, the slope will be  higher . So, that is why we can get the survivor  
curve increased markedly with temperature . 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:29)  
 
Now, we look into the important parameter that is called the decimal reduction time . In 
terms of microbial death kinetics  D value has enormous important . It is defined as  the 
time required to reduce  the number of microorganism  by 1 log cycle or by 90 percent or 
by a factor of 10 at a given temperature . So,  D value will change if we change the 
temperature . 
Higher values of D imply that at a given temperature the micro  organism has higher 
resistance to thermal death . Now if we plot  the number of microorganism number of 
viable microorganism in the log scale with respect to time . So, we can get that the time 
required to reduce the viable microorganism by 1 log cycle that is termed as a D value .  By definition, t= D   when   N 0/N = 10  
Then,         D = 2.303/k   
So, this is how we def ine the decimal reduction time . 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:11)  
 
 Now we will see certain interesting phenomena , when we have different pattern of 
microbial destruction curve  if we plot the similar way like viable microorg anism in the 
log scale in the y axis, and in the x axis the time in minute . So, let see; what are the 
different kind of curve we may get . First curve  which is the simple first order 
inactivation curve , and it shows that the from the start of heat processing the viable 
microorganism  start decrea sing and we can easily calculate the  D value that is the one 
log cycle  destruction time , at a particular temperature  
 If we look into the curve B here in this section we can find initial little  increase or a little  
flat portion  and then it start decreasing . So, this initial increase that we can observe here  
this is because there are certain heat resistant spore  they may get activated during the 
start of or the onset of the thermal processing and as the  as the severity of the hea t 
treatment increases  so, those again start decreasing.  
So, therefore, after certain period of time they  follow the first order  distraction . Now 
look into the third  plot that is initial lag in the in activation curve . So, initial l ag if it 
observe d there  will be this kind of a  pattern that we may  see in the microbial destruction 
curve  and after that lag period it follows the  first order destruction . So, this lag period is ; obviously,  lower than the decimal reduction time normally  and almost 90 percent 
destru ction may happen in this zone  and then it start decreasing . So, this kind of pattern 
is visible when the initial lag in the inactivation curve will be observed . 
 The fourth  one if we look into this pattern , this has a  two distinct slope  here. So, we can 
get the  D value for first this section a different  D value and from here to here, a different 
D value . So, these indicate that  there are  two microorganisms , which have the different 
heat resistance to thermal death at the same temperature . So, the D value of which  is 
lower will first show the destruction curve  and then the  D value for which it is higher  
will follow the next . 
So, in such case  we can  write the microbial inactivation  requirement the time for both the  
two microorganism and then we can  analyse that what will be the  D value for those 
different combination . So, if we  write the equation for this .  
So, for the normal destruction the curve  will be simply          log N 0/N = t/D.  
If we consider the  case of initial  lag in th e inactivation curve , then we can write it as:       
N0/N = 1+ (t-tL)/D  
So, this tL is the lag time . Obviously  here, t>tL. 
After that if we  consider the  mix cultur e. So, then the total microbial count viable 
microbial count  after processing time  t will be  given by:  
N=NA0[10] −t
DA+NB0[10] −t
DB 
Where  NA0 and NB0 is the initial microbial count of  micro be A and B respectively at the 
start of  processing and then after time ‘t’. So, when we consider that  DB if since  DB is 
higher , the thermal death time for the second microbes is h igher  or if we consider as D2 
here it is hig her, than this second term does  not have significance for the lower time  
period when ‘t’ is small . So, then only the first term prevail  that is showing by first part 
of the curve . And in the next section where the time is  significantly higher than it shows 
that importance of the next curve  will be shown , that is because of the seco nd or more 
heat resistant micro organism . 
Coming to the last plot  that is tailing  of an inactivation curve , this is because if the 
number of microorganism is very high . So, towards  the end of the logarith mic cycle that  
it will follow will form a tail  like structure with increasing time . So, it can be avoided if  
initial load of the microorganism can be reduced . (Refer Slide Time: 16:29)  
 
So, let us  take one numerical example , the following data were  obtain ed from a thermal 
resistance experiment conducted on a spore suspension at 112 °C.calculate the  D value of 
microorganism at a given temperature . So, what is given simply ? Time is given and 
number of survivors is given . What we can do is  we can  plot the number of survivors in 
log scale in the y axis and in the x axis we can plot the time  and simply measure the time 
required to  reduce the number of microorganism by 1 log cycle . 
So, what we can do is the first plot the log of N microbial  populati on with respect to time 
and we can measure the  D value here we are getting  4.1 minute s. (Refer Slide Time: 17:28)  
 
So, next is  half-life period what is half-life period ? So, this method of expressing the rate 
of a reaction is commonly used in radioisotope  decay . So, for that case  it is very 
common . It is the time required for the reactant to lose half of its original concentration ,  
By definition, t= t 1/2   when   N 0/N = 2 . That means, we have  made the number of viable 
microorganism half of the initial microbial population . So, then t1/2 i.e. time required to 
make the microbial population , half of its initial microbial population will be  
 t1/2 = ln(2)/k = 0.693/k   
 (Refer Slide Time: 18:30)  
  Next is thermal death time that is F value . So, for we are  talking about that  total 
processing time and that depends on a particular temperature , because mi crobes have 
different resistance to thermal destruction at different  temperature . So, total tim e required 
to accomplish a stated reduction in the population of microorganism at a given 
temperature is termed as  F value . So, this time can be expressed as multiple of  D value , 
because we know that one log cycle reduction takes a time which is represente d by D 
value , but one log  cycle reduction is not enough to preserve the food material . Normally 
there are  fixed number of logarithm ic cycle  that is being stated for any food preservation . 
For example commercial sterility is being done by  12 D  that is 12 log cycle reduction s. 
That means, if one log cycle reduction takes a time D. So, n log cycle or any log cycle 
reduction will be multiplied by that number with the  D value . For example, 99.99  percent 
reduction  in microbial  population would  be equivalent to 4 log cycle reduction i.e. F 
value  = 4D. So that means, we can change this 99.99  percent to the probability value and 
we want to  initially if it was 1. Now it will be 1-0.9999  and that is eventually coming  
1/1000 . So, that is  104 so that means, F=4D. 
So, that is the total process time is F = D log 10 (N0/N)  
If you r emember our earlier equation  log 10 (N0/N) = t/D, now we can w rite D log 10 
(N0/N) = t, and this ‘t’ is eventually F value for the total process time when we strictly 
define that how much log cycle reduction we want in a process . And this number of log 
cycle reduction is also called the sterilizatio n value and sometime it is expressed as  “S”. 
So, D×S = F value or  the total process time . (Refer Slide Time: 21:51)  
 
So, let us take one example  the most probable spore load in a canned food is 100 and the 
D0 of the spore is 1.5 minutes.  Calculate a target F 0 for a thermal process such that the 
probability of spoilage is 1 in 100,000. If under the same conditions C. botulinum type B 
has a D 0 of 0.2 min, would the target F 0 value satisfy the minimum 12D process for C. 
botulinum ? Assume an initial spore  load of 1 per can for C. botulinum .    
Now the case is  that whenever we say that  D0 value or  F0 value , we want to mea n that 
reference temperature . So, at a Celsius scale we mean the  referen ce temperature as 121°C 
and in the Fahrenheit  we make it  250 °F. So, here we want to  calculate that  F0 at 121°C 
and D0 at 121°C is given as 1.5 minute . So, N0 that is  the spore load is 100 and the  
probability of spoilage is 10-5.  
F0 = D 0 ×S = 1.5×7 =10.5 minutes   
Now, the second case it is mentioned that for the C botulinum sterilization value is  12 
and F0 = 0.2×12 =2.4 minut es. So, would the target  F0 value satisfy the minimum  12 D 
process of c . Botulinum ? the answer will be yes because it will  always consider that 
within this time . (Refer Slide Time: 24:38)  
 
So, next is temperature dependence of reaction rate . Temperature dependence o f reaction  
rate is expressed in terms of Arrhenius  equation as the temperature dependence of any 
chemical react ion also expressed in terms of Arrhenius  equation .  
k=𝐴0[𝑒]−𝐸𝑎
𝑅𝑇 
Now, generally it happens that with increasing temperature , the reaction become faster . 
So, that is activation energy become slower that  is why -ve sign has been incorporated . 
“A” is a constant here and its units a re the same as those of the reaction rate constant k , 
which in turn depend on the order of the reaction , R is universal gas constant its value is 
8.314 kJ.K-1.kmol-1. ‘T’ is the absolute temperature in K and  Ea is activation energy in 
kJ.kmol-1.  
Now if we plot the  ln k with respect absolute temperature . So, we are getting a slope 
which is a straight line from the slope we can get the value of activation energy because 
we know the value of R. 
k=𝐴0[𝑒]−𝐸𝑎
𝑅𝑇 
So, if the reaction  has happened at  two different  tempe ratures  like T1 and T2. k2
k1=[e]Ea
R  T2−T1
T1T2   (Refer Slide Time: 28:19)  
 
temperature coe fficient  Q10 it is nothing  but the ratio of k2/k1 number of times a reaction 
rate changes with the  10 degree c hange in temperature ; that means, if you look into the  
previous equation when  T2-T1=10 then k2/k1 one can be represented as  Q10. So, if the 
reaction rate doubles with a  10 degree , then the  Q10 will be 2. So,  Q10 by definition we 
can write :    
k2
k1=Q10 
if T 2 – T1 = 10oC, then Arrhenius  equation for two temperatures become  
 Q10=[e]Ea
R  10
T1T2  
Now we can also see that if graphically we want to express the rate of reaction  in the y 
axis and temperature in the x axis. the reaction which does  not change with tempera ture. 
That means, the rate will remain same if we increase the temperature that is represented 
by this red line , and where the  Q10 or the  reaction  rate changes with a factor of  2 that is 
this deep blue line ; and the light blue line showi ng the reaction ra tes change with the  10 
degre e change in the temperature by 3 times ; so most of the biochemical reaction and 
physiological processes fall within this range .  So, here we can write : k2
k1= Q10 T2−T1
10 (Refer Slide Tim e: 31:06)  
 
Next is Z value which is the thermal resistance constant , it is defined as the temperature 
change required to change the  D value by a factor of  10 or 1 log cycle . D value  versus 
time if it is plotted in a logarithmic scale , the graph looks very similar to the survivor  
curve and this  one is called  the thermal death time plot . The straight line on the graph 
means that if you change the temperature by a certain amount , the D value will change 
by a factor of 10. So, it is like if we plot this  tempera ture here and  D value  in a in a  log 
scale  here. 
So, we will get this kind of a plot from where at a particular temperature we can 
calculate the log D  and at another temperature . And, we can  get the value of ‘z’ that is  
increase in temperature needed to cause  one degree destruction  or one log cycle 
destruction in the microbial count . (Refer Slide Time: 32:28)  
 
So, here it is this is the z value as  plotted  there that the chan ge in temperature needed in 
°C to cause one log cycle reduction . We can plo t this as ΔT vs (log D1- log D 2). From fig. 
                                                           slope = z = 𝑇2−𝑇1
log𝐷𝑇1−log𝐷𝑇2 
 We know already   D1/D2=k2/k1   then above equation becomes     
 
D1
D2=k2
k1=[10] T2−T1
z 
For bacillus stearo thermophil lus, z value is  10°C, D121 is 4 minute . That means, at 121 °C 
if the processing time is  4 minute  the same microbial destruction if you want to  cause  at 
111 °C. So, that time requirement will be 40 minutes and the same microbial  destruction 
if you want to  cause  at 101 °C it will  take 400 minutes . (Refer Slide Time: 33:58)  
 
So, there is an  example n a laboratory experiment it was found that heating a suspension 
of spores at 120°C for 100 seconds results in a 9 -log killing of the spores. To achieve the 
same reduction at 110° C, 27.5 minutes are needed. Calculate the decimal reduction time 
at the two temp eratures, the z value, the  energy of activation and the Q 10 of the thermal 
inactivation process at these temperatures.  
For 9-log killing of the spores  at 120°C : D120 = 100/9 = 11.11 seconds,   
Similarly  at 110°C:                                  D110 = (27.5×60)/9 = 183.33 seconds  
 (Refer Slide Time: 34:53)  
 Z value we can calculate by the formula : 
D1
D2=k2
k1=[10] T2−T1
z 
we can calculate the z . So, z is coming 8.21 °C. An activation energy we can calculate 
from this  equation:  
z=ln⁡(10)×T1T2
EaR  
 
E is coming here 350.6×103 kJ/kmol.K . Finally, the Q 10 value is calculated from this 
expression :  
 Q10=[e]Ea
R  10
T1T2  
 
So, it is coming 2.8. So, for 10 degree increase in temperature the reaction rate w ill 
increase by  2.8 times . 
So, we will stop here  we will continue in the next class . 
Thank you .
