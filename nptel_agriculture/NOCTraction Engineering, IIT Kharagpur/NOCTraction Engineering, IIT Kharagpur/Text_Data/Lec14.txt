Lecture 14: Tractive effort and slip of a powered rigid wheel  
 
Hi everyone. This is Professor H. R aheman  from Agricultural and Food Engineering 
Department, IIT Kharagpur. I welcome you all to this NPTEL course on Traction  
Engineering. This is lecture 14, where I will try to cover tractive  effort and sl ip of a 
powered rigid wheel. When I said it is a powered rigid wheel that means, a rigid wheel 
which is powered which is moving at an angular speed omega.  
 
  So, the concepts which will be covered will be your sl ip and tractive effort. So, if you 
look at this figure in the left corner, I have shown a powered whe el with a rolling radius R 
and it is moving with an angular speed ω and V is the actual speed , which I have indicated 
here. So, since it is powered that means, it will be developing a shear force along the or 
shear stress along the contact area. These are , this is the contact area where you can develop 
the shear stress because of the interaction between wheel and soil.  
 
  Now if you want to develop tractive force which is developed by the rigid wheel, then we 
need to know what is the shear stress developed . And, shear stress is a function of  shear 
displacement. So, we have  to find out what is the shear displacement at the contact area, 
then only you can find out what is the shear stress developed . And, shear stress into the 
contact area  so, that will give you the thrust or the tractive effort which is developed by a 
rigid wheel. So, shear displacement which is developed along the contact area of a rigid 
wheel will be decided based on this analysis of slip velocity. Whereas, at slip velocit y that 
means, difference between theoretical speed and actual speed , both are in the sa me plane, 
then only you can find out the difference and then that is denoted as 𝑉𝑗. 
 
  Now if you consider that wheel is rolling. So, 𝜃0 represents the angle at which the wheel 
is in touch with the soil and this is called entry angle. And we will now consider a poin t 
‘say A’ which is making an angle 𝜃 with the vertical. So, at ‘A’ the peripheral speed will 
be equal to ωr, ω is the angular speed, r is the rolling radius. So,  peripheral speed will be 
ωr and this will be equal to your 𝑉𝑡 which is theoretical speed.  
 
  Now, at this point the actual velocity is given as V. Now , if you resolve this into this plane  
so, this angle will be equal to how much? 𝜃. So, V if is resolved in this plane , then it 
becom es Vcos θ . So now,    
𝑉𝑡−𝑉cos𝜃=𝑉𝑗 
 
  So,in other  words , you can say slip velocity is nothing, but the tangential component of 
the absolute velocity at any particular point where you are interested in finding out the 
slip velocity ok.  
Now if I substitute , V in by i, i in the sense we know slip velocity is nothing, but  
𝑖=1−𝑉
𝑉𝑡 
where i is the slip, V is the actual velocity and V t is the theoretical velocity. So, from 
here,  
𝑉=(1−𝑖)𝑉𝑡 
𝑉𝑗=𝑉𝑡−(1−𝑖)𝑉𝑡cos𝜃=𝑉𝑡[1−(1−𝑖)cos𝜃] 
you can find out  
𝑉=(1−𝑖)𝑉𝑡 
Now and Vt is nothing, but 𝑤𝑟, is the theoretical speeds.  
𝑉𝑗=𝑤𝑟[1−(1−𝑖)cos𝜃] 
So, if you look at this equation , now the slip velocity is a function of angular speed, is a 
function of rolling radius, is a function of angle theta and is a function of slip.  That 
means, for a given wheel and given operating condition that means, where the angular 
speed is given , then slip velocity is a function of theta and slip. Now from the slip 
velocity , you have to find out what is the shear displacement, shear displacement which is 
occurring at the contact area. So, if j is the shear displacement along the wheel soil 
interface , then j can be written as : j is the shear displacement, displacement then this can 
be written as V j × dt. 
 
  So, if you want to find out for the entire contact area , then this has to be integrated from 
say θ to θ0, if I am considering from point A ok.  
𝑗=𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 =∫𝑉𝑗.𝑑𝑡𝜃0

=∫𝑤𝑟[1−(1−𝑖)cos𝜃].𝑑𝑡𝜃0
𝜃 
𝜃=𝑤𝑡 𝑑𝜃
𝑑𝑡=𝑤 
 
 
𝑑𝜃
𝑤=𝑑𝑡 
=∫ 𝑤𝑟[1−(1−𝑖)cos𝜃].𝑑𝜃
𝑤𝜃0
𝜃 
=∫𝑟[1−(1−𝑖)cos𝜃].𝑑𝜃𝜃0
𝜃 
𝑗=𝑟[(𝜃0−𝜃)−(1−𝑖)(sin𝜃0−sin𝜃)] 
 
 
 The next question is , what is the relationship between shear stress and shear 
displacement?  In nature , from the experimental observation what you observed is , there 
are three relationships normally existing.  So let me show those relationships between 
shear stress and shear displacement. So , in case of a loose sand or saturated clay or most 
of the disturbed soil , the relationship between shear stress and shear displacement  
𝜏(𝜃)=𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥 (1−𝑒−𝑗
𝑘⁄); where 𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥is written as 𝑐+𝜎(𝜃)tan∅, 𝜎 is the normal pressure.   
 
  Now for organic terrain , the relationship between shear stress and shear displacement is , 
𝜏= 𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑗
𝐾𝜔)𝑒𝑥𝑝 (1−𝑗
𝐾𝜔) 
where Kω is the shear displacement where the maximum shear stress occurs. Now , if it is 
a compact sand or silt and loam , then the relationship is  
𝜏= 𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐾𝑟{1+[1
𝐾𝑟(1−1/𝑒)−1]𝑒𝑥𝑝 (1−𝑗
𝐾𝜔)}×[1−exp (−𝑗/𝐾𝜔)] 
where Kr is the ratio of residual stress to the maximum shear stress and τmax and Kω is the 
shear displacement where the maximum shear stress occurs. You know you can choose 
any one of these equations and then find out the shear force which is acting. Once you 
know the shear stress then we will find out what is the shear force acting. So,  shear stress 
will be supposed  for example, we take shear displacement in loose sand or in most of the 
disturbed  soil, that is the relationship is ,  𝜏=𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥 (1−𝑒−𝑗
𝑘⁄) 
=(𝑐+𝜎𝑡𝑎𝑛∅)(1−𝑒−𝑗
𝑘⁄) 
  If I take this relationship then the equation will be so, shear stress distribution wil l be 
like  
𝜏(𝜃)=𝜏𝑚𝑎𝑥 (1−𝑒−𝑗
𝑘⁄) 
=(𝑐+𝜎(𝜃)tan∅)(1−𝑒−𝑟
𝑘[(𝜃0−𝜃)−(1−𝑖)(sin𝜃0−sin𝜃)]) 
 
  Shear force will be like this.  So,shear force will be equal to the shear stress into area.  
So, I can write shear stress ,  
𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 =𝜏(𝜃).𝑑𝐴  
𝑑𝐴=𝑏𝑟𝑑𝜃  
𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 =𝑏𝑟 𝜏(𝜃) 𝑑𝜃 
  So, this will be the shear force. Now, for finding out tractive force , you have to resolve 
into two components. One is the horizontal component and this horizontal component is 
denoted as tractive effort ok.  So, tractive effort will be denoted as F , will be equal to this 
shear force which you got cos component of that one ok.  So, 𝑏𝑟 𝜏(𝜃)cos𝜃𝑑𝜃 
  
 So, this has to be integrated from 0 to θe. So, this becomes a tractive effort.  
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒  𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑡 ,𝐹=∫𝑏𝑟 𝜏(𝜃)cos𝜃𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑒
0 
Now, while evaluating the performance of a power rigid wheel , we have to find out in 
addition to tractive effort other parameters like what is the drawbar pull ok, then what is 
the weight, the expression for weight and then we can find out what is the wheel torque 
and of course, we can find out other forces like coe fficient of traction and coefficient of 
gross traction CGT . So, for finding out pull , then we have to find out what is the rolling 
resistance ok. So, if you know thrust, thrust minus rolling resistanc e will give you the 
drawbar pull.  
 
  Now because of the weight , there will be soil reaction . The radial force will be acting 
and it will have two components ok. So , the, this horizontal component of radial force , 
this is radial force, the horizontal component of radial force will be equal to your rolling 
resistance. So, first we have to calculate the vertical component one vertical component is from the shear force, the other vertical component is from the radial force. So, summation 
of that will give you , what is the weight. So, weight will be equal to  
𝑊=𝑟𝑏 [∫𝜎(𝜃)cos𝜃𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑒
0+∫𝜏(𝜃)sin𝜃𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑒
0] 
 
 
  Now for drawbar pull , this will be equal to P and this is tractive effort which is nothing, 
but  
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑤𝑏𝑎𝑟  𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑙 ,𝑃=𝑟𝑏 [∫𝜏(𝜃)cos𝜃𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑒
0−∫𝜎(𝜃) sin𝜃𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑒
0] 
for the wheel torque , if you know the tractive effort then tractive effort multiplied with 
the rolling radius. So, that will give you the wheel torque. So,  
𝑊ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑙 𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑞𝑢𝑒 =𝑟𝑏∫𝜏(𝜃)𝑑𝜃𝜃𝑒
0 
 So, these are the expressions which you can calculate. The only thing which we need to 
know is , what is the distribution of shear stress, what is the distribution of the normal 
stress . Then only you can find out the shear force, then what is the p ull which is 
developed, what is the vertical load which is acting. Now, one scientist , he found out the 
shear stress and normal stress distribution and he measured and derived from this formula 
and then what he observed is very interesting thing, interesting in th e sense , this is the 
measured and predicted shear stress and normal stress in compacted sand at a slip of 22.1 
per cent. If you look at this figure , then the procedure which we followed for finding out 
shear stress and normal stress distribution along the contact area is quite close . We can 
say, the measured and the pre dicted values are quite close. Hence , the procedure which 
we followed is on light. So , in this lecture attempts are made to derive equations for 
predicting tractive effort for a powered rigid  wheel and that the important components are 
the shear displacement and we have derived a n expression for slip velocity and slip 
velocity from where we tr ied to find out what is the shear displacement and knowing the 
shear displacement and shear stress relationship , we can establish what is the shear stress 
which is prevailing in the contact area. Now, knowing the shear stress then we try to 
multiply the contact area so that we can find out what is the tractive effort developed.  
 
  So, you can refer to the books like the theory of ground vehicles by Wong J Y and soil 
dynamics in tillage and traction by William R Gill and G Vandenberg. Thank you.
