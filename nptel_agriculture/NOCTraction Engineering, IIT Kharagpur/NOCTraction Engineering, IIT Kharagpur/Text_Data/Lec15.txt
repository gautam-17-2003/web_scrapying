Lecture 15: Tutorial 3 – Computation of rolling resistance of rigid wheel and pneumatic 
wheel  
 
  Hi everyone, this is Professor H. R aheman from Agricultural and Food Engineering 
Department, IIT Kharagpur. I welcome you all to this NPTEL online course on Traction 
Engineering. This is the lecture 15, where I will try to take a tutorial related to rolling 
resistance. That means, how to find out rolling resistance of a rigid wheel as well as a 
pneumatic  wheel.  
 
 So, the concept will be , how to find out rolling resistance of a rigid wheel on a horizontal 
as well as inclined surface, how they are different , and then finding out the rolling 
resistance of a pneumatic wheel. When I say , pneumatic wheel means there will be two 
modes of operation, one is rigid mode and the other one is elastic mode ; and how to find 
out rolling resistance in these two modes of operation that we are going to discuss with 
the help of simple problems. Now, if you look at the problem which are given here , if a 
free rolling rigi d wheel of diameter 80 cm, section width 10 cm and the total weight 10 
kg. This has to be operated on a horizontal surface with shear deformation modulus 2000 
N/mn+2 and exponent of sinkage as 0.5. Under these conditions , you have to find out what 
is the force required to tow the wheel. So, the information which are given as very clear . 
One is diameter which is given as 80 cm, the other one is section width which is given as 
10 cm, b is given as 10 cm and weight which is acting on the wheel is 10 kg. Now, if a 
wheel is there and we want to find out the rolling resistance . This is a horizontal surface , 
as I said so, then the first thing is , what is the sinkage and what equation we are going to 
utilize.  
 
 Since the diameter is more than 80 cm. So, we can conveniently apply B ekker's equation 
for finding out rolling resistance.  So, which is nothing,  
𝑅= 𝑏𝑘𝑍𝑜𝑛+1
𝑛+1 
and we are interested in because Z 0 is not known. So, we have to find out what is the 
value of for Z 0. Now, this is W ok.  
  So, expression for Z 0 will be , if you look at the B ekker's equation. So, Z 0 is nothing, but 
this will be equal to  
𝑍𝑜=[3𝑊
𝑏𝑘√2𝑟(3−𝑛)]2
2𝑛+1
 
Now, in the problem the value of k is given , shear deformation modulus. So, k is given as 
2000 N/mn+2 and exponent of sinkage n is given as 0.5. So, now, you have to substitute 
this value . That means, weight is given , k value is given , b value is given , diameter that is 
2r is given , 3 minus n , n is given. So, now, you substitute these values and find out what 
is the , what is the value for sinkage. So, once you know sinkage , you substitute in this 
equation . Rolling resistance is equal to (bkZ0n+1)/(n+1). So, we will find out the value of 
rolling resistance. So, rolling resistance is nothing, but the force required to tow the 
wheel.  
 
 So, that is will be the force required to tow the wheel and it comes out to R or the towing 
force comes out to 71.178 N . Since weight is less , sinkage is less , so obviously, the 
rolling resistance will be less. So, it is basically the first thing which you look into this , is 
this rigid wheel , free rolling rigid wheel and there is no power. So, it is a towed wheel.  
 
 So, we immediately apply B ekker's equation, but in B ekker's equation , there are certain 
limitations which are to be looked into. So, limitations is sinkage should be a low and the 
diameter should not be less than 50 cm. So, so , that way it is satisfying , diameter is 80 cm 
and sinkage you can verify from here and then apply B ekker's equation to find out what 
is the rolling resistance. Now, next thing is , if the same wheel is to be towed off on an 
inclined surface , that means, now the surface is no more horizontal. So, it has been 
inclined.  
 
 So, the new setup will be like this and this inclination is given as 15 °. What will be the 
force required to tow the wheel on the slope? So, for this , you have to draw it . This is the 
wheel. Now , weight I said  10 kg. So, it will have 2 components. So, this is θ. 
 
 So, this component will be 𝑊cos𝜃 and this component will be 𝑊sin𝜃 . I want to tow 
the, move the wheel upward against the slope. So, what to do now? We have to find out 
again , because this wheel is satisfying B ekker's theory that is rolling resistance theory. 
So, we will use the same equation . R will be equal to  
 
𝑅= 𝑏𝑘𝑍𝑜𝑛+1
𝑛+1 but this is only for horizontal surface. Now, this in the surface is inclined and there is a 
component is acting along the slope 𝑊sin𝜃 against the direction of travel , opposite to 
the direction of travel.  
 
 So, that means, the rolling distance will be no more the expression which I have given 
for horizontal condition. So, rolling resistance  will be  
𝑅𝑅=𝑏𝑘𝑍𝑜𝑛+1
𝑛+1+𝑊sin𝜃 
So, this is the additional component which will come into picture. Now, what is Z0 in this 
case? How to find out Z 0? For a horizontal s oil surface , we calculated Z 0 is  
𝑍𝑜=[3𝑊cos𝜃
𝑏𝑘√2𝑟(3−𝑛)]2
2𝑛+1
 
 
 So,B is known , k is known , because these are not going to change and exponent of 
sinkage is not going to change. So, W sinθ, we know θ. So, you can calculate W sinθ and 
then immediately you can find out the Z 0 value and then substituting in this equation , this 
will be the final value which is required to tow the wheel upward along the slope. Now, if 
somebody will say , I will move this one downward then the difference will be how 
much? So, instead of plus W sin theta , because we are rolling it the opposite direction , so, 
this will be -Wsinθ, ok. 
 
 So, that is the difference . This component is acting downwards. So, it will be minus 
because we are rolling downwards. So, these are the difference we have to take into 
consideration. I hope , I have clarified in the sense first you have to see whether the 
whether the conditions which are given are applicable to the B ekker's limitations which 
are given within that or not. If it is satisfying then you take the help of B ekker's equation 
and the derivations which are , which we have already done for sinkage that we take and 
find out and from that sinkage then find out what is the rolling resistance.  
 
  And if it is an inclined surface then look at the , first you have to draw it very neatly and 
then see whether we are moving upward or downward because that W will be now 
reserved into two components , one is horizontal component , that the other one is vertical 
component and  that vertical component is responsible for developing that sinkage. So, 
the vertical component will be W cosθ. So, instead of W , we have to replace with W cosθ 
and if you are moving upward then the horizontal component has to be added , and if you 
are moving downward then the horizontal component W sin theta is to be deducted. So, 
this is all you have to keep in your mind then only you can solve this problem.  Now, next problem is , a two -wheel drive tractor when it is fitted with a  13.6-28 tyre at 
the rear axle carrying a load of 15 kN and this has to be operated in soil with a pressure 
sinkage parameters  exponent of sinkage n as 1, frictional modulus of sinkage k ϕ 1520 , 
1520 k N/mn+2 with both the wheel sharing equal load. Then two inflation pressures 70 
and 100 kPa are proposed.  Now, the corresponding pressure due to carcass stiffness is 20 
and 35 k Pa, respectively. So, what is asked is to find out the rolling resistance of rear 
tyres for both the conditions and then from there you have to suggest which inflation 
pressure is to be used. So, when I say it is a pneumatic wheel.  
 
 So, the first thing which you have to look into is , what is the mode of operation . There is , 
there are two modes of operation ; one is rigid mode , the other one is elastic mode. If it is 
in rigid mode then you have to follow B ekker's equation , if it is elastic mode you have to 
follow others , other formulas which I am going to derive which we have already derived 
in our theory classes. So, to find out the mode of operation , we have to first find out what 
is the critical ground pressure.  What is given , n value is given , n is 1, kϕ is given as 1520 
kN/mn+2. Since kc value is not given , that means, kc is assumed to be 0.  
 
 So, kϕ value , K = (kc/b) + kϕ. So, now, since kc value is not given , we assume as to be 0. 
So, this component will be 0 . Now, kϕ will be equal to K. Now, for finding out the critical 
ground pressure , critical ground pressure , so, we denote it as P g critical , PGRc. 
𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙  𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑  𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 , 𝑃𝐺𝑅𝑐=𝑘12𝑛+1⁄ [3𝑊
(3−𝑛)𝑏√𝐷]2𝑛2𝑛+1⁄
=100  𝑘𝑃𝑎  
 
So, the axle has to carry a load of 15 kN. So, W will be equal to 15 /2 and the other thing 
which is given is , both the wheels are sharing the same load . That means, equal load. So, 
that is why , I have divided W as axle weight divided by 2.  
 
 So, that way you get 7.5 kN. Now, to find out b and D. So, the tyre is a bias platter and 
since no aspect ratio is given.  So, we assume that aspect ratio as 0.75. So, now, find out 
the section width b and diameter D. So, section width b will be equal to how much? It is 
given as 13.6.  So, 13.6 × 2.54. So, that will be in centimeter and for finding out D , we 
have already given that formula in the theory class. It is 1.06 times nominal rim diameter , 
which is here 28 , this is in inches. So, I have to convert it into centimeter or meter then 
plus 0.75 , which is the aspect ratio into 2 × 13.6 into … this  is in inches , again multiplied 
2.54. So, that way we will get a diameter of 1.27 meter , ok. 
 
 So, D is now calculated , b is calculated. Now, substituting here , you have to find out and 
exponent of sink is given. So, this comes out to be 100 k Pa critical ground pressure. Now, 
two inflation pressures are suggested ; one is 70 k Pa. So, Pi is 70 and corresponding carcass stiffness is 20 psi. So, Pc corresponding to 70 is 20 kPa. 
 
 The other condition , Pi is 100 kPa and P c is 35 kPa. So, P i + Pc in the first case is 90 kPa 
and in the second case P i + Pc will be equal to 135 kPa. 
𝑃𝑖=70 𝑘𝑃𝑎 ,𝑃𝑐=20 𝑘𝑃𝑎  
𝑃𝑖+𝑃𝑐=90 𝑘𝑃𝑎

So, now the second condition says , 𝑃𝑖=100  𝑘𝑃𝑎 ,𝑃𝑐=35 𝑘𝑃𝑎  
𝑃𝑖+𝑃𝑐=135  𝑘𝑃𝑎

  Now this is the rolling resistance for a single wheel . If you want to find out rolling 
resistance for a single wheel , so, that means, you have , this has to be multiplied with 2 . 
Same is the case here , multiplied 2. Now you verify , where  the rolling resistance is more 
than accordingly . We reject that one the , where the rolling resistance is less , that has to be 
taken and then that , corresponding to that what is the inflation pressure that has to be 
recommended for continuous operation. So, while calculating the rolling resistance , there 
are 2 things to be seen ; one is what is the mode of operation . Once you decide the mode 
of operation , that means, we have to first find out what is the critical ground pressure and 
then knowing the inflation pressure and the pressure due to carcass stiffness , if some of 
these 2 pressures are lesser than the critical ground pressure then we recommend , we say 
that the wheel is operating in elastic mode . If it is more than critical ground pressure , we 
say that this is operating as a rigid wheel. So, if it is in under rigid wheel , then we apply 
Bekker's equation to find out what is the rolling resistance and if it is in the elastic mode 
then we first find out Z0 sinkage , taking into consideration the sum of inflation and 
carcass pressure and the modulus of sinkage and then from there we find out what is the 
rolling resistance.  
 
  Hope , I have clarified this problem. So, in brief , I can summarize , in this tutorial , I tried to cover the concepts of computing rolling resistance on a horizontal as well as inclined 
surface , where how to take the component of weight , that is important in inclined surface. 
So, once you decide that , then it becomes easier for you to calculate the rolling resistance. 
So, if it is rolling down , then the component , that is sin θ component of W , has to be 
deducted . If it has to be rolled up , then the cos θ component is to be taken up. Similarly, 
we tr ied discuss about the rolling resistance of a pneumatic wheel , where we discuss ed 
what is the rigid mode, how to find out rigid mode , then what is the elastic mode and how 
to decide that the wheel is in under elastic mode . And once you decide that , then 
following the equations which are given , you can find out what is the rolling resistance. 
So, the inflation pressure and the carcass stiffness pressure gives to carcass stiffness 
which gives minimum rolling resist ance that has to be recommended for using the using 
in the tr ack. Thank you.
