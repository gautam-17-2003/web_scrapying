Comparison of single tyre with dual tyres  
Hi everyone, this is Professor H Rahman, from Agricultural and Food Engineering department IIT 
Kharagpur. I welcome you all to this NPTEL course on Traction engineering.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:48)  
 
This is lecture 23rd, where I will try to compare the performance of a single tyre with dual tyres.  
(Refer Slide Time: 00:56)  
 
Means, the concept which will be covered is how to compare and on what basis you should 
compare. Should I go for comparing tractive efficiency or should we go for comparing coefficient 
of traction or should we go for comparing rolling resistance? So, we wi ll discuss in detail. Usually 
rolling resistance, coefficient of traction both are dependent on a number called mobility number. 
If you are concentrating on Brixius equation, then there is a number called mobility number which 
combines both soil parameter s, fuel parameters and the weight which is coming on the tyre.  
(Refer Slide Time: 01:38)  
 
So, this is expressed as  
𝐵𝑛=𝐶𝐼𝑏𝑑
𝑊×(1+5𝛿
ℎ)
(1+3𝑏
𝑑) 
Since rolling resistance is a function of mobility number, coefficient of traction is also  a function 
of mobility number and of course, productive efficiency, which is the ratio of coefficient of traction 
to coefficient of gross traction, so, that is also a function of mobility number. Hence, instead of 
calculating rolling resistance or calcula ting coefficient of traction or calculating productive 
efficiency, what we have to do is simply we have to calculate the mobility number and then 
compare the mobility  number of a single tyre with a dual tyre. So, that is good enough to indicate 
that which tyre is good or bad. That means, higher the mobility number better will be the 
performance. So, a tyre having higher mobility number will give you better performance.  
(Refer Slide Time: 03:04)  
 
So, what I will do is, I will take an example in the sense I will take a single tyre and then I will 
take 2 tyres of same dimensions. That means if a single tyre if I took so, this is having width b, 
diameter D. I will take a dual tyre, so that means 2 tyres will be there. So obviously their dimension 
will change. So, this is b 1 this is b 1, so, summation of b 1+b1 should be equal to b and diameter will 
remain same.  
So, now I try to find it, find the mobility number. These are denoted a single tyre, this is dual tyres. 
Here we are maintaining the dimensions same that means, twice b 1 will be equal to b and diameter 
for single will be equal to diameter of dual. So, the weight which is coming in a single wheel tyre, 
if it is W so, here it will be W 1; W/2, W /2. That means W will be shared by the 2 tyres. So, only 
the weight  will change. So now, for finding out the mobility number of a single tyre, so, that will 
be equal to  
𝐵𝑛𝑠= 𝐶𝐼𝑏𝐷
𝑊×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏
𝐷) 
Now, for mobility number of dual tyres , it will be ,  
b will be equal to twice b1 or we can say you can find out mobility number of 1 tyre then you 
multiplied with 2 that is also possible.  
𝐵𝑛𝑑=2×(𝐶𝐼𝑏1𝐷
𝑊2⁄×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏1
𝐷)) 
b1×D/d, ’d’which I have written in small , and  that is capital D that is diameter, capital D. So,  
So, now, if I want to find out which one is better, then I can take the ratio B ns by B nd. So, obviously,  
𝐵𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝑛𝑑= 𝐶𝐼𝑏𝐷
𝑊×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏
𝐷)
2×(𝐶𝐼𝑏1𝐷
𝑊2⁄×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏1
𝐷)) 
So, now, if you simplify this one, so, this will cancel out now, this will be 4W . So, W, W will 
cancel out so, CI, CI will cancel out because we are operating in the same soil and D will also 
cancel out. so, what is remaining is  
𝐵𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝑛𝑑= 𝑏
4𝑏1×1+3𝑏1
𝐷
1+3𝑏
𝐷 So, this ratio . If it is lesser than 1 that means, dual tyre is performing better than the single tyre. If 
this ratio is higher than 1, that means single tyre is performing better than a dual tyres. This is the 
case when the tyre dimensions are remaining same whatever dime nsions we follow for single tyre, 
same dimensions we are following for dual tyres.  
That means the combined width will be equal to the width of the single tyre. So, if you look at the 
ratio here, obviously, we are dividing with a higher number in the denominator, so it will be always 
lesser than 1 this ratio is always less than 1 that mea ns dual is better than dual tyres are better than 
single tyres if same dimensions as that of a single tyre is maintained for dual tyres. Now, the other 
extreme case is, when the dimensions are different somewhere somebody selects a 13.6-28 tyre  
and somebo dy wants to use dual tyres of different dimensions, may  be diameter is less or the more. 
So, then we have to find out which diameter will give you better performance.  (Refer Slide Time: 09:17)  
 
So again, we will try to draw a single tyre. So , this is having width b1, diameter d1 , and duals  will 
have some, I will take some smaller ones. So , this is , ‘d2, b2’. ‘b2, d2’ that means summation b2 
plus b2 is not equal to b1  and d2 is not equal to d1. This is the condition. In the first case, we 
decided that twice b2 will be equal to b1 and D  remain same, but in this case, we will decide in a 
different way.  
Now again we will take the help of Brixius number. So, Brixius number, sorry mobility number, 
mobility number for single tyre will be equal to, mobility number of single tyre will be equal to  
𝐵𝑛𝑠=𝐶𝐼𝑏1𝑑1
𝑊×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏1
𝑑1) 
Assuming that weights is acting same in both the tyres whether it is single whether it is dual, so, 
that means  W by 2 will be shared by 1 tyre. Now, for dual  tyre, mobility number will be  
𝐵𝑛𝑑=2×
(  𝐶𝐼𝑏2𝑑2
𝑊2⁄×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏2
𝑑2)
)   
Now, if I want to find out the ratio Bns/Bnd, then again , So, that means here it will become  
  
𝐵𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝑛𝑑= 𝐶𝐼𝑏1𝑑1
𝑊×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏1
𝑑1)
2×
(  𝐶𝐼𝑏2𝑑2
𝑊2⁄×(1+5𝛿
ℎ
1+3𝑏2
𝑑2)
)   
So, if I simplify further, so, since they are operating in the same soil condition, when you try to 
compare and assuming that the δ/h ratio is remaining same for both the cases then this can be 
simplified as  
𝐵𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝑛𝑑= 𝑏1𝑑1
4𝑏2𝑑2×1+3𝑏2
𝑑2
1+3𝑏1
𝑑1 
If you want that Bns should be greater than bnd, that means mobility number of a tyre 1 is to be 
greater than the mobility number of dual tyres then be this component this ratio  
𝑏1𝑑1
4𝑏2𝑑2>1+3𝑏1
𝑑1
1+3𝑏2
𝑑2 
If this condition is satisfied then single will be better than the dual tyre. If this is not satisfied, that 
means  
𝑏1𝑑1
4𝑏2𝑑2<1+3𝑏1
𝑑1
1+3𝑏2
𝑑2 
then the duals are better than this single tyre. If duals are better, or if y ou want the dual tyres should 
behave and perform in a better way, then what should be the diameter for a given section width? 
So, to do that exercise, I will show you an example, where it will be clear how to find out the 
diameter which is required to make  the dual tyres performance better than the single tyre.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:02)   
Now I am taking the mobility number ratio on the y axis then I vary the diameter of dual tyres 
starting from that means the b2 value, b2 value I vary from 0.1 to 2, these are in meters. Now, 
section width I have taken initially say 0.2 suppose, initially i t have taken 0.2, then corresponding 
to this I tried to find out for different diameters. Section width I have varied from 0.2 to 0.4, 2 
section width I have taken and diameter d2 I have varied from say 0.7 meter to 2 meter.  
So, initially I took b2 as 0.2 Then I tried to change the value of d2 and found out what is the bn 
dual. Now take the ratio from the single. The derivations which I derived for single tyre, so, if the 
ratio whatever I found, I try to plot it for different values of diameter for a section width of 0.2, I 
varied 0.8, 1, 1.2 like that, then I tried to plot it. So, this is for section width 0.2 meter. Similar 
exercise I carried out for b2 is equal to 0.4 meter. So, and then I varied the diameter from 0.7 to 
1.2 and then I got this line.  
So, if duals had to be equal to single tyres, then the ratio is 1. So, there is a minimum thing. So, I 
draw a horizontal line here, so, wherever it does the 2 graphs, 1 is for 0.4 meters, the other one is 
for 0.2 meter. So, there I draw 2 verticals to touc h the x axis. That means, it will indicate what 
should be the minimum diameter required so that the dual will behave like a single tyre. That 
means, performance of dual tyres will be equal to the single tyre. So, what I observed here is, for 
a section widt h of 0.4 meter the diameter is around 1.1 meter and for a section width of 0.2 meter 
the diameter is around 1.3. So, diameter should be around 1.3. So, this is the minimum diameter 
so, you have to have a diameter more than this then only the dual will perf orm better than the 
single wheel. So, this is how we will, we are going to decide the dimensions of dual tyres, if we 
are interested to replace the single tyres.  
So the simplest way of calculating this is, you do not have to compare the rolling resistance or you 
do not have to compare the coefficient of traction or you do not have to compare the tractive 
efficiency. All these 3 parameters, they are strongly depende nt on mobility number, if you are 
using brixius equation for evaluating its performance. Hence, instead of calculating all those 
values, we just compare the mobility number that is sufficient to compare the performance.  (Refer Slide Time: 19:13)  
 
Briefly, I tried to compare the performance of single tyre with dual tyres  when they are of same 
dimension. That means the diameter or width of single tyre is equal to diameter and width of dual 
tyres then I varied the diameter and width of dual tyres. They are not same as single tyres, so for 
both the cases I have given the exp ressions. Then the second thing I tried to find out what should 
be the minimum diameter if you are changing a single tyre to dual tyres. So , for different sections 
width, I have found out I have plotted and that gives you an idea how to compare the performa nce 
of a dual tyre with a single tyre.  
(Refer Slide Time: 19:58)  
 
So, you can refer to some of these books that will help you further to calculate this performance. 
Thank you.
