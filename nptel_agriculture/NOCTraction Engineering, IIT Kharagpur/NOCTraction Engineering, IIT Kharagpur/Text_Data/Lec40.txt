Lecture 40: Tutorial - 8 
Hi everyone, this is Professor H. Raheman  from Agricultural and Food Engineering 
Department.  I welcome you all to this traction engineering course.  This is lecture 40 where I 
will try to give a tutorial on how to compute slip angle, understeer coefficient and verify the 
slide slope stability of  a tractor while moving across a slope.   
So, the concepts will be a computation of lateral force and slip angles developed by a tractor. 
Then we will be finding out under steer coefficient to decide the steering condition whether it 
is under steer, over steer or neutral steer.  Then we will try t o verify the stability of the tractor 
while moving across a sloppy land.  So, I will discuss three problems.   
The first problem is a 6 -16 tractor tyre has a cornering stiffness of 133.30 kilo Newton per 
radian and a camber stiffness of 229 Newton per radian.  The camber angle at which the tyre 
is fitted to the axle is 4 o.  If both the cornering force and camber thrust are acting in the same 
direction and they are linearly related to slip and camber angle respectively, then determine the 
total lateral force developed for a slip angle of 3 o.  So, what we have to do in this problem is, 
we have been given the data re lated to cornering stiffness of front that is tyre 6 -16 and the 
camber stiffness.   
So, we know that total force which is developed side force developed is dependent on the lateral 
force due to slip angle 𝐹𝑠𝛼 plus lateral force due to camber angle  𝐹𝑠𝛾. So,  
𝐹𝑠=  𝐹𝑠𝛼+ 𝐹𝑠𝛾 
 I have put a plus sign because I have indicated that they are acting in the same direction.  So, 
that is why I have put a positive sign.  If I have indicated that they are acting in opposite 
direction then obviously, I have to put a minus sign depending o n their directions.  Now what 
is given is, they are linearly related obviously, t hese slope, the slip angle is 3o and the camber 
angle is 4o.  So, obviously, at a smaller angle, we know that a side force is linearly related to 
the cornering stiffness.  
So, what you can write is  
𝐹𝑠𝛼= 𝐶𝑠𝛼×𝛼=133 .33 ×3×𝜋
180 𝑘𝑁 
Similarly, for finding out the side force due to camber angle, we have to take the camber 
stiffness.  So, 𝐹𝑠𝛾 which is the side force of the lateral force developed due to camber angle.  
So, I can write as  
𝐹𝑠𝛾= 𝐶𝑠𝛾×𝛾=229  ×4×𝜋
180  𝑁 So, what we get is in Newton, what we have got here is in kilo Newton.  So, change the units 
then add it that will give you the total lateral force which is developed by a 6 16 tractor tyre 
with the given data.  So, basically you have to see that what is t he relationship since it has been 
given that it is linearly related.  So, it becomes easier for you to calculate the lateral force.  And 
the second thing which has to be seen is whether the directions of this lateral force that is due 
to slip angle and the  lateral force which is developed due to camber angle whether they are in 
the same direction or they are in the opposite direction. So, that has to be seen then only you 
can easily calculate what is the total lateral force.   
The next problem is related to the steering.  A two-wheel  drive tractor which has a total weight 
of 18.2 kilo Newton , it has a wheel base  1.85 meter with a static weight distribution of 30 
percent at the front axle and 70 percent at  the rear axle . The cornering stiffness of each of the 
front tyre is given and that of  the rear tyre is given.  So, what you are been asked to find out is 
draw conclusions for the slip angle of front and rear tyres ok.  So, what you have to find out is 
first the understeer coefficient . For finding out the understeer  coefficient, what you have to do 
is, k us is nothing, but weight coming on the front  wheel divided b y c, the cornering stiffness  
𝐾𝑢𝑠=W𝑓
𝐶𝛼𝑓−W𝑟
𝐶𝛼𝑟 
So, now in this data which are given we have to find out these values then only you can compute 
k us.  So, what data is given , cornering stiffness is given for the front tyre and the rear tyre.  So, 
these values are given.  
So, 𝐶𝛼𝑓 is given as 38.92 and 𝐶𝛼𝑟 is given as 36.25 and W f and W r we have to find out.  So, 
how to find out Wf is the weight coming on each of the wheel.  So, the axle weight now you 
have given the distribution with a total weight.  So, 
W𝑓=0.3×18.2/2 
for the rear axle ,  
W𝑟=0.7×18.2/2 
So, you know 𝐶𝛼𝑓 you know W f you know 𝐶𝛼𝑟 you know W r. So, if you substitute in this 
equation that will give you a value.  So, if the value is positive that means, this is an understeer 
condition.  If value is negative this is an overst eer condition.  If  the value is 0 then it is neutral 
steer.  So, we have to draw  conclusion about slip angles.  
So, slip angles are nothing, but α.  So, α is nothing, but F by c s F , lateral force by Csf so that 
means, what is the lateral  force developed by C sf.  So, first we have to find out 𝐾𝑢𝑠. Once you 
know the 𝐾𝑢𝑠 value then we will find out whether  it is a neutral steer , understeer or oversteer.  
Now, if it is neutral steer the turning radius , the other component which I ask is turning radius  
is constant.  If it is understeer the n turning radius will be decreasing and if it is oversteering  
that means , when the 𝐾𝑢𝑠 value is negative it is oversteering that means, the turning radius is  
increasing.  So, that is the conclusion you have to find out.  Now, he is asking the determine the speed 
above which the tractor exhibit directional instability .  So, when we find out 𝐾𝑢𝑠 that will 
indicate whether you are in understeer oversteer condition. If  you are in understeer condition,  
then you have to calculate the Vcharacteristic speed  which is nothing. B ut in this case , what we 
observed is , we are getting a 𝐾𝑢𝑠 value  which is negative that means  that means it  is an 
oversteering condition.  So, oversteering condition means we have to find out the critical speed.  
So, critical speed , Vcritical will be equal to √𝑔×𝐿
−𝐾𝑢𝑠. 
So, since 𝐾𝑢𝑠 you got a negative value.  So, when you substitute here , you will find out the 
velocity some value.  So, roughly around it is coming 13.1 m/s so that means, this is the critical 
speed  beyond which if you exceed then there will be directional instability.  Suppose the data 
which are given that will lead you to a value of k us positive.  
So, what will happen if is a positive value that means, the turning radius is decreasing.  So, you 
have to calculate b characteristics which is nothing, but √𝑔×𝐿
𝐾𝑢𝑠.  So, that will give you a value 
which will indicate the limit beyond which if you exceed that  is going to give you directional 
instability.  I hope I have clarified.   
 
Then the third problem will be related to the side slope stability. A tractor fitted with 6 16 tire 
in the front axle and 13.6  28 tire in the rear axle . It has a total weight of 2400 kg with a weight 
distribution of 35 percent and 65  percent at the front and rear axles , respectively.  The tra ck 
width 1.2 meter and it is cg is at a height of 0.8 meter from ground and this tractor  is moving 
across a sloppy land, which is 20o with the horizontal.  The front tire has a cornering stiffness , 
camber stiffness.  The rear tire has a cornering stiffness of this much.  The camber angle at 
which the tire is fitted with the front axle is given.  If both the cornering forc e and camber 
thrust are acting in the same direction and they are  linearly related to slip and cambe r angles 
with a slip angle of 4o for the front tires  and 3 o for the rear tires . Verify whether the tractor is 
stable during operation against  overturning and sliding.  So, for overturning we have to find out 
𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  value.  
So, 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  is nothing, but 20o, beta is given as 20o.  Now you have to find out  
track  width  
height  of c g from  the ground 
If 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  value is greater than this, then there is a possibility of overtu rning.  So, in our condition 
track width is given as 1.2×0.8/ 2.  So, if you take tan inverse of this value , then  this will give 
around 36o. Whereas, 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  will give you a value around 0.36  and and this value is around 0. 5 
something.  So, that means 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  is lesser than this expression.  So, the vehicle is stable , it is 
not going to overturn.  So, this is one condition.   The second condition is; we have to verify the stability against sliding . We have verified that 
the vehicle is stable  against overturning.  Now for  sliding, we know that there is a vehicle or 
tractor is moving. c  g is here.  So, it will have a component 𝑊sin𝛽 and this is lateral force , 
which is developed at the  rear wheels . Similarly,  lateral force will be developed at the front 
wheels.  Now 𝑊sin𝛽 has to be supported by this lateral force.  So, now the second component 
we have to find out , what is the total lateral force acting on  the tractor or the vehicle.  So, to 
find out total . There will be two front wheels , there will be two rear wheels , assuming that  each 
of the front wheels will be developing the same lateral force.  So, for the front wheel, we have 
to calculate lateral force for the front wheel . We have to  calculate lateral force due to slip angle . 
This has to be added with lateral force  due to camber angl e and they are linearly related, the 
thrust is a linearly related.  
Total lateral force for front wheel =  lateral force due to slip angle  + lateral force due to camber 
angle . 
=1000 ×133 .2×4×𝜋
180+229 ×4×𝜋
180 
This is the lateral force , which is developed at the front wheel.  This has to be multiplied with 
2 to find out the total lateral force developed by the front wheels.   
Similarly, you have to find out the lateral force which is developed at the rear wheel since  there 
is no camber angle in case of a tractor at the rear wheels.  So, we are only considering lateral 
force due to slip angle only.  So, it is given rear wheels cornering stiffness is given as 90.  
=1000 ×90×3×𝜋
180 
 So, this has to be multiplied with 2 to find out the total lateral force developed by the 2  rear 
wheels.  Now, since total lateral force you have to find out for the tractor.  So, that will be 
summation of this force plus this force.  So, that will be equal to , at least equal to 𝑊sin𝛽. W 
is given as 2400× 9.81× sin𝛽. 
So, this should be equal to at least then only the vehicle is not going to slide.  If it is higher than 
these two summations,  then the vehicle is going to overturn.  If it is lesser than these two then 
the vehicle is stable.  So, let me repeat this one.  The first case is we have to find out regarding 
the overturning.  
For overturning we have to find out 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  value should be greater than  T by 2 H, ok.  So, this 
condition has to be satisfied.  If 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝛽  is less than this value,  then there is no overturning.  Now, 
the second condition of instability is your sliding.  So, that will come , this 𝑊sin𝛽 component 
should be lesser than this side force which is developed by the tractor.  Since the tractor has 4 
tires and we assume that each of the front wheel will develop  the same lateral force and each 
of the rear wheels will be developing the same lateral  force.  So, we try to find out what is the 
lateral force developed by the front e ach of the front wheel .  So, since front wheel has both slip 
angle and camber angle so you have to find out lateral force  due to slip angle and you have to 
find out lateral  force due to camber angle.  And since the cornering stiffness and the camber stiffness are given so by multiplying this. W e can find out , what is the total lateral force acting 
on each of the wheel.  Then we multiply with 2 to find out what is the total force from the front 
wheels.  
And in case of rear wheel , since there is no camber . So, only you will calculate the lateral force  
which is developed due to slip and we follow the same procedure because the slip angle  is 
given and the cornering stiffness for rear tires are given.  So, whatever value is obtained that 
has to be multiplied with 2 and the summation of these  2 forces should be greater than this 
𝑊sin𝛽  then only there will be no sliding otherwise  there will be sliding.  So, in brief I have 
discussed how to calculate lateral force, then how to calculate the steering characteristics  that 
means whether the vehicle is understeer, oversteer or neutral steer.  And basically this is 
calculated taking into consideration the understeer coefficient which is  a function of weight 
distribution and is a function of the cornering stiffness.  Then we try to calculate the side slope 
stability for 2 conditions , one is yo ur overturning the other  one is sliding.  
I hope these 3 problems is , they are going to help you in understanding these concepts, concepts  
of over steering, under steering, side slope stability.  Thank you.  You can refer to theory of
