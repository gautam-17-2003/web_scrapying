Lecture 13: Motion resistance of a track  
 
  Hi everyone, this is Professor H. R aheman  from Agricultural and Food Engineering 
Department from IIT Kharagpur.  I welcome you all to this NPTEL certification course 
on Traction  engineering.  This is lecture 13, where I will try to cover how to find out 
motion resistance of a track .  Track  and wheel, these are the two important traction  
systems which are used for developing traction i n case of a tractor or crawler tractor or in 
case of high HP tractors.  
 
So, the concept will be , how to find out motion resistance of a tr ack? That means , how 
much fo rce is required to tow this tr ack.  So , the tr ack is basically assumed to be similar 
to rigid footing and the tr ack, if you look at the right -side figure , there I have indicated a 
track.  So , it will have certain amount of l ugs, but the l ugs are not that prominent as in 
case of a wheel. So , it has certain width which is not visible in this diagram.  
 
 So in the cross section , I have given width as B and length as L and it will be carrying 
certain amount of weight W and there will be rollers to give tension to this tr ack so that 
during engagement with the soil that means during shearing action which the tr ack is 
going to create during operation , so, the belt has to be in tension or the tr ack has to be in 
tension . That is why , we have provided these rolle rs. So here , what we have assumed is , 
the normal reaction during the interaction process with the soil the reaction will be 
exerted on the tr ack by the terrain , and here we have assumed that the pressure is uniform 
throughout the contact . That is an important assumption you can say. And the normal 
reaction exerted on the tr ack by the terrain can be equated to that beneath a sinkage plate 
at the same depth in a plate sinkage test. So , this is very important.  
 
So, the normal reaction will be equal to your pre ssure beneath a sinkage plate which is at 
the same depth as that of the n depth at which the tr ack is moving. So, the assumptions 
are, the tr ack layer does not tilt in operation . That is number one assumption , and the load 
on the tr ack is uniformly distributed.  If it is not uniformly distributed then the reaction 
which you are getting at the soil tr ack interaction surfaces , it may not be uniform. So , that 
is why we say load on the tr ack is uniformly distributed and the tr ack layer  does not tilt 
during opera tion. The contact area very simpl e, I have done , this is  the length and this is 
the width.  
 Length and width multiplication will give you how much will be the contact area and the 
force which I have indicated F here , is the thrust force. But we are not interested in 
developing thrust force . Now we will be discussing about that little later. So , only what 
we can discuss is , how much is the force required to tow this forward.  So , we know that 
in a plate at sinkage test  
𝑝=𝑘 𝑍0𝑛 
𝑝=𝑊
𝑏𝑙 
If plate has to be sunk into a depth of z 0 then pressure at that depth will be equal to  
𝑍0=(𝑝
𝑘⁄)1𝑛⁄
=(𝑊
𝑏𝑙.𝑘)1𝑛⁄
 
Now P , as you have assumed that the pressure is uniformly distributed that means load is 
uniformly distributed. So , weight divided by area , that can be denoted as pressure. Now I 
substitute here , W is the normal load which is acting on the tr ack, then b is the width of 
the tr ack and l is the length of the tr ack in contact with the soil.  
 
Now , the work which is done in compacting the soil along the tr ack length l and it will 
make a r ut of width b, because wheel width is B. So , this is your width B which is 
denoted as B.  So , it will make a r ut in the bottom surface when it is in contact with the 
soil so that area is equal to B into L.  Now , what will be the work done in making a r ut of 
depth Z0?   
𝑊.𝐷.=𝑏𝑙∫𝑝𝑑𝑧𝑍0
0=𝑏𝑙∫𝑘 𝑧𝑛𝑑𝑧𝑍0
0=𝑏𝑙 𝑘 𝑍0𝑛+1
𝑛+1 
 
=𝑏𝑙
(𝑛+1)𝑘1𝑛⁄ (𝑊
𝑏𝑙)𝑛+1
𝑛 
 
This is the work done expression. Now , if I want to tow this tr ack to a distance ‘say L’ in 
a horizontal direction . And then the work done in towing this tr ack by a force which is 
called towing force that will be equal in magnitude to the motion resistance due to torque 
and compaction. So , let me repeat again. If I want to tow this tr ack to a distance L by 
applying a force which is called towing  force then that towing force will be equal in 
magnitude to the motion resistance. Why?  Due to compaction of soil.  
 
And, if that is so , then I can write , work done in compacting the soil will be equal to your 
towing force. Towing force , if you denote it as R , it has to be to wed for a distance l. So,  𝑊.𝐷.=𝑅.𝑙 
𝑅×𝑙 =𝑏×𝑙
(𝑛+1)(𝑘𝑐
𝑏+𝑘∅)1(𝑛)⁄  ×[𝑊
𝑏𝑙](𝑛+1)𝑛⁄
 
R=𝑏
(𝑛+1)(𝑘𝑐
𝑏+𝑘∅)1(𝑛)⁄  × [𝑊
𝑏𝑙](𝑛+1)𝑛⁄
 
R=1
(𝑛+1)𝑏1𝑛⁄(𝑘𝑐
𝑏+𝑘∅)1(𝑛)⁄  ×[𝑊
𝑙](𝑛+1)𝑛⁄
 
 
 
So, contact area we have taken as  length of the flat person L 1 × section width. So, W by 
L2 × B, so, that means more or less they are similar . Then the question arises , which one 
will give you lesser rolling resistance when they are carrying the same parameters nearly 
same expressions because P gr(n+1)/n, (W/ BL)(n+1)/n. Then the question arises , which one 
will give you lesser rolling resistance and why? So, if you think little bit , this BL for 
track and BL1 for wheel , they are not same. Usually , the tr acks are longer and width of 
tracks are longer whereas, the section width of wheel or contact length of a flattened 
portion of the wheel , they are much smaller than the contact length and section width of 
track.  So , that means , this area of the wheel is , if you denote it as area of wheel and if 
you denote it as area of tr ack. 
 
So, area of wheel is much -much less than area of tr ack. For the same load , your contact 
pressure is more in case of wheel and in case of tr ack, it is less . That means , there will be 
more compaction in case of wheel and hence , there will be more rolling resistance. So, 
that is the reason a tr ack gives lesser rolling resistance as compared to your pneumatic 
wheel. Now, if you compare with a rigid wheel , rolling resistance of tr ack and rolling 
resistance of a towed rigid wheel. So, what is the difference? Here , you are not getting 
anything related to pressure . You are only getting in terms of W , in case of in terms of 
diameter , and the section width B and the modulus of sink age is K, so, it is difficult to 
compare in fact.  
In the previous case , these are similar . So, that is why , I made it very clear , which one 
should give you lesser rolling resistance. But if you look at now this equation , it is 
W(2n+2 )/(2n+1 ). This is very -very high , whereas , it is only W(n+1)/n. So, that itself gives you 
that, yes tr ack is better than rolling resistance of a rigid wheel. If the weight is same the n track is going to give you lesser rolling resistance.  
 
Now, coming to the diameter , as we increase the diameter , the rolling resistance of towed 
rigid wheel reduces because is the negative , the power (2r)-(n+1)/(2n+1 ). Here also , the 
area(n+1)/n. But the area which is obtained in case of a tr ack and the area which is obtained 
in case of a towed wheel they are also different. The area of a tr ack is much -much higher 
than area of a towed rigid wheel. Because , towed rigid wheels , its width cannot be more 
than say 5 centimeter , 2 inches , whereas , track width is much more than that . And length 
of the tr ack is even , if it is kept same as the diameter of the towed wheel then definitely , 
At will be higher than Atrw. 
 
So, that means tr ack, rolling resistance of a tr ack is lesser than the rolling resistance of a 
rigid wheel. Now, comparing the modulus of sinkage , because this is same for you , 
cannot change the soil conditions. So, it is K1/L whereas , it is K-1/(2n+1 ). So, there is a n 
advantage here. Advantage means , -1/(2n+1 ). 
 
So, this will give a little higher resistance. Denominator is 2 n+1, whereas , it is in the 
numerator,  it is only 1 /n. So, that way if you compare again , the rolling resistance of a 
track can be seen to be lesser than the rolling resistance of a rigid wheel. So, in total , we 
can say , rolling resistance of a tr ack will be always lesser than the rolling resistance of a 
pneumatic wheel when they are operated in the same soil condition , in the same under 
same weight , and same is the case with rolling resistance of a rigid wheel.  
So, in this lecture , what I have done is , I have tried to derive expression for rolling 
resistance of tr ack. Then , we tried to compare the rolling resistance of pneumatic wheel 
and rigid wheel  expression which we derived earlier , and then we had a comparison 
individually , and then what we conclude from here is that rolling resistance of a tr ack is 
lesser than the rolling resistance of a pneumatic wheel or rigid wheel. So, briefly , if I 
conclude about this lecture , I have made an attempt where I derived the equation for 
predicting motion resistance of a tr ack, then I tried  to verify how it is different from 
pneumatic wheel or towed rigid wheel and you can refer the book theory of ground 
breaking by Wong J Y. Thank you.
