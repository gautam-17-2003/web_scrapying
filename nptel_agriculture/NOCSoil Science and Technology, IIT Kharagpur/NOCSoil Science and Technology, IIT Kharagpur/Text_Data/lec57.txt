Modeling Continuous Variables
(Refer Slide Time: 00:28)
Welcome friends to this second lecture of week 12 of Soil Science and Technology and
in this lecture we will be talking about the different data processing for digital soil
mapping and then we will be talking about different types of continuous modeling for
digital soil mapping. 
So, as I told you that digital soil mapping requires some data processing because all soils
are not measured universally at the same depth because as you can see here there are
different horizon like O A B C these are the master horizons; however, in the legacy soil
data which are compiled by different scientists you will see some data is available some
data is not available. So, you see some time the data for O and A is available; however,
the B and C data is not available. However you will sometime you will see O and C data
is available; however, B and A data is not available.
So, there is a continuous there is a heterogeneity in terms of data availability and that is
why we require some digital using some data processing. So, some soils are sampled per
you know all soils are not measured universally at same depth, some soils are sampledper horizon or at regular dips, some soil studies examine only the topsoil while other
sample the bedrock depth and then different soil attributes are measured at some location
and depth, but not on others.
So, you can see huge amount of heterogeneity as far as the, you know, this legacy soil
data is concerned that is a number of pre processing steps are needed to fulfill the
requirements of DSM.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:56)
So, what are these steps? With the first step is that soil depth function and the traditional
method of sampling soil involves dividing a soil into profile into horizon as you can see
O A B and C and the number of horizon and the position of each are generally based on
attributes easily observed in the field such as morphological properties you have already
discussed that. And from each horizon a bulk sample is taken and it is assumed to
represent the average value for a soil attribute over the depth interval for which a sample.
For example, if you are taking a bulk sample from the B horizon, then we generalize the
property of that sample as the representative property of B horizon.(Refer Slide Time: 02:41)
However what is the problem in that case? The first issue is from the pedological
perspective soil generally varies continuously with depth; however, representing to the
soil  attribute  values  as  the  average  over  the  depth  interval  of  horizon  leads  to
discontinuous or stepped profile representation. 
For  example,  we  remember  that,  we  know,  we  know  that  the  soil  property  varies
continuously from the top of the profile to bottom of the profile, but according to this
bulk soil representation if we take one sample from here, one sample from here and one
sample from here and based on the measurement of that particular samples, we are
generalizing the whole depth that is the whole horizon.
So, that is producing some discontinuous or stepped profile representation so that is
problematic, this so what if one wants to know the value of an attribute at a specified
depth. So, if we want to know the value at this particular depth what is how it will be
possible? It will not be possible if you are taking a bulk samples and generalizing the
whole, you know, horizon. So, that is why we need some depth function and let us see
what are the other issue?(Refer Slide Time: 04:01)
The second issue is difficult for DSM modeling because observation at each horizon for
each profile will rarely be the same between any two profiles. So, observation at each
horizon for each profile will be rarely be same between any 2 profiles.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:20)
So, these are two issues for which we require some pre processing and the solution is we
cannot, remember that we cannot ignore the legacy data because this is the major base
data which we require for digital soil mapping. So, we need to derive a continuous
function using the available horizon data as input for example, if in this case we arehaving the depth data from, you know, somewhere between 10 to 30 and then 30 to 60
and then up to 140 or something like this.
So, these are our available clay data and we need to fit a polynomial and exponential
decay type of depth function, as you can see this is a polynomial or exponential type of
depth function this red line and this is a continuous depth function also I am sorry this is
a continuous depth function like equal area quadratic spline function. So, as you can see
here these are the available soil data for different depths like, you know you know, for
say for 10 to 20 and then 20 to 60 and so on so forth up to 140.
So, we are fitting a continuous depth function like equal area quadratic spline function
here represented by this red line and using this continuous depth function we can predict
the depth at a particular point.
(Refer Slide Time: 05:54)
So,  this  is  an  example  and  let  us  see  in  details  about  the  mathematical  function;
obviously, this equal area spline the formula for equal area spline was first we got from
this Malone et al in 2009, where we assume that the measurement of bulk sample from
layer i is assumed to reflect mean attribute level apart from measurement error. So,
mathematically the measurement can be modeled as y i equal to f i bar plus e i. So, it is
assumed that the true soil attributes really vary across very smoothly with the depths.So, the soil attribute varies smoothly from the top of the profile to the bottom of the
profile and this is translated into mathematical terms. So, we denote depth function by x
and  the  depth  function  describe  the  two  attribute  values  by  f  x,  a  function  of  x.
Obviously, so which means that f x and its first derivative are both continuous and the
first derivative of x is a square integrable. So, the depth of the boundaries of n layers are
given by for example, x n x n and x n.
So, the f i bar here this f i bar is the mean value of this f x over the interval of x i minus 1
to x i. So, it is for one layer it is the mean value over the interval and e i as the
measurement error; obviously, this is a measurement error and with the vary with the
mean 0 and variance sigma square. So, f x represent a spline function which can be
found by minimizing this term and this term basically represent the first term basically
represents the fit to the data and the second term measure the roughness function or
penalty. So, roughness function or f x, so expressed by its first derivative.
So, the parameter lambda here basically this is a lambda which is called the tuning
parameter, it is basically tradeoff between fit and the roughness penalty and the solution
is a linear quadratic smoothing spline. So, let us see, so this is basically a mathematical
function of these linear quadratic smoothing spline and let us see how it will work
(Refer Slide Time: 08:11)
So, this is basically the equal area spline or linear quadratic spline. So, this is a quadratic
spline which you use to harmonize the soil data across our desired depth, remember thatthis is called equal area spline because for each horizon area to the left fitted spline you
know; obviously, equal to the area to the right fitted spline. So, that is why it is called
equality, so you can see this is spline, this area will be equal to this area, this area will be
equal to this area, this will be equal to this area. So, that is why it is called the equal area
spline.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:50)
Another name of this spline is called mass preserving spline, because the original data is
preserved and can be retrieved again via integration of the continuous spline. So, the
spline parameter are the value of soil attribute at the standard depth that are specified by
the users and remember that using the spline profile, using this mass preserving equal
area spline you can harmonize soil profile data and model at a specified depth.(Refer Slide Time: 09:17)
So, as I have told you the global soil map dot net project is a global consortium that, you
know, aim to make new digital soil map of the world using this state of the art and
averaging and this emerging technologies for soil mapping and predicting soil properties
in fine resolution, they have prescribed some 6 standardized depth. These 6 standardized
depths are these 0 to 5 centimeter, 5 to 15 centimeter, 15 to 30 centimeter, 30 to 60,
centimeter 60 to 100, centimeter and 100 to 200 centimeter.
So, if our profile data looks like this the original legacy data looks like this it is possible
by using this equal area spline to get the continuous value or, you know, of this particular
parameter up to our desired depth by fitting this equal area spline.(Refer Slide Time: 10:15)
So,  guys  another  important  aspect  of  data  processing  is  intersecting  soil  point
observation with environmental covariates. So, in order to carry out DSM in terms of
evaluating the significance of environmental variables in explaining the special variation
target soil, you know, the target soil variable under investigation, we need to link both
sets of data together and extract the values of the covariance at the location of the point
data.
Obviously, as you can see as we have discussed already the workflow of in the work
flow of DSM, the first starting point is our legacy soil data and remember all this legacy
soil point data is, you know, is associated with some x and y coordinate data because we
are using our GPS receiver to measure their coordinates. So, once we measure their
coordinates the next step we can see we are stacking all the covariance data and it is
required that the covariate values from the grids once you stacked all these covariates
you know.
The next step we have to extract all the covariates values which is available for this
particular soil point data and all these will be related by this x and y coordinates. So,
again once we get the legacy soil data and their coordinates the next step will be to
extract the soil covariate information for those particular points. So, we do not need the
soil covariate information at for all the area, we only need the soil covariate information
for those particular points for which the legacy soil data is available. So, we call itintersecting and this is another major pre processing step before we go for digital soil
mapping.
So, in a nutshell you know; obviously, we will start with this x y data, we will start with
this geo data, legacy soil data and then we will fit a mass depth integrating function or
equal area spline to get the depth wise values of that variable up to our desired depths.
There are 6 desire depths as proposed by global soil map dot net project and once we
harmonize all the profile data up to that standard depths the next step is to stack the
covariates and extract the covariate information for those particular points for which we
have the soil point data.
Now once we get this thing then we will use this in the spatial prediction model using
some mathematical function to produce the 3D maps of soil for that particular property.
So, this is in a nutshell about the work flow in the digital soil mapping and so we have
covered the basic overview of digital soil mapping, the next and very very important
topic of in digital soil mapping is modeling and mapping of continuous variables.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:29)
And in this we will be discussing about the model validation and then what is multiple
linear regression, what is decision trees and what is cart and also we will be discussing
about random forests in brief also.(Refer Slide Time: 13:45)
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:51)
So, guys if we talk about the model validation let us see what is regression? Now in the
regression basically we are interested to predict certain variable using another random
variable. So, for example, if we have two variable say x and y or in other words say y is
our as far as the soil data is concerned for example, soil organic carbon and x is our for
example, let us say it is soil clay.
So, if we want to have for example, we have 100 soil samples and for 100 soil samples
we have 100 records of organic carbon and 100 records of corresponding clay content.So, if we want to predict this y or target variable using our independent variable let us
see this y is our target variable and x is the independent variable, if we want to predict or
if we want to make a relationship where we will predict the y in terms of x, that is called
regression.
So, simple linear regression basically takes the form mx plus c or here y is our target, x is
the predictor, m is the slope and c is the offset. Now you can see here, this is the
regression in a nutshell; obviously, in the x axis these are the predict these are the
predictors, in the y axis this is the target variable and ultimately we try to fit a linear
regression; we try to fit a linear, you know, we try to fit a linear relationship as you can
see here this is the straight line and it has a representation of b x i plus alpha; obviously,
alpha is the offset and beta is beta is that here the slope. 
So, this is called regression this is the simplest form of regression and in case of multiple
linear regression when there are more than one predictor variable then we call it multiple
linear  regression.  So,  guys  this  is  the  overview  of  regression  and the  why  we are
discussing this let us see. Now, if we go back so once we create a model for predicting a
particular soil property, why we create a model?
We create a model so that it can generalize or it can predict any particular property using
some unknown samples. So, that is the major use of creating a model. So, once we create
a particular linear model or any other non linear model using some soil data or soil
covariate data, the next step is to, you know, ascertain their accuracy, model accuracy.
Now the model accuracy can be calculated by model validation statistics.
The model validation is basically the appraisal of the usefulness of the model or in other
words whether the created model or calibration model we call it. The calibration model
can be used to generalize or to predict any unknown sample that can be, you know, that
can be predicted via validation. So, there are several important points; obviously, like
root mean squared error; root mean squared error can be, you know; obviously, you can
say this is a formula of root mean squared error.
And this is one of the major important index of soil index of model validation we always
want the root mean squared error to be minimized because the less the root mean squared
error the more accurate the model and also bias which is called the mean error of
prediction and it is defined by this formula and then Pearson correlation coefficient;Pearson  correlation  coefficient  basically  shows  the  strength  of  linear  relationship
between two variables. So, this is another index of model validation.
And then Linâ€™s concordance correlation coefficient which is a single statistic that both
evaluates  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  relationship,  remember  that  it  is  often
referred to as the goodness of the fit along the 45 degree line thus it is probably a more
useful statistics than the R square alone. So, if we consider this x and y and we create a
model like y equal to alpha plus beta x so, this will be a linear regression and in this
linear regression; obviously, remember that these are some important indices like R
square RMSE.
Remember that R square measures the strength of the regression relationship and R
square varies from 0 to 1 as R square tends towards 1, the model is more accurate and as
it goes towards 0 the model is there is no relationship and RMSE is also Root Mean
Squared Error, as you can see this is root mean squared error. So; obviously, this is an
RMSE and RMSE measures that what is the strength of this linear relationship. So, these
are some important indices of model validation and they have some spacing values
which generally tells us whether that model is good or bad.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:11)
So, let us see what are the different types of model validation, model validation is of two
types; one is, you know, basically the first way of doing the model validation is using
some additional independent data set which is basically unbiased and we can draw thatby simple random sampling and or stratified random sampling this is the best way. I
mean you create one model and then you draw a random sample and independent data
set and which is unbiased and you use this, we know, independent data set to judge the
accuracy of your created calibration model.
So, this is the first, you know, way and this is the most important way. Another is the
data sub setting and we will be talking about in details. So, the data sub setting basically
are of three types one is random hold back or hold out and then K fold validation and
leave one out cross validation or LOOCV. Now in the random hold back or hold out
basically we divide the data into 70 percent and we create the model using this 70
percent data we call it calibration data set, the rest 30 percent of the data is used for
validating the model ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 21:38)
So, let us see them one by one. So, model validation basically, ask whether, you know,
can we fit our data into this model. So, for example, here there is an particular example it
is a independent variable and this is a dependent variable, the question is can we learn or
create a relationship that fits our data y equal to f x plus noise or f x plus error.
So, you can see there are three different relationship one is the linear relationship another
is quadratic relationship another here you can see piecewise linear relationship. So, let us
see them one by one and our question is which one is the best.(Refer Slide Time: 22:24)
So, you can see what do we really want? So we why not choose the method with the best
fit of the data. So, our intention is to select the best model which can generalize this
behavior either linear or quadratic or piecewise linear.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:42)
So, first let us see what is the holdout method? So the holdout method is a simplest kind
of cross validation. The data set is separated into two set randomly sometimes called the
training set and testing set. Training set, another name is calibration set and testing set
the other name of testing set is validation  set and the function approximator  fits  afunction using the training set only and then the function approximator is asked to
predict the output values for the data in the testing set.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:13)
So, let us see this in the step by step. So, let us see this is test set method, so randomly
first in the first we randomly choose 30 percent of the data to be in the data test set and
the remainder is in the training set. So, as you can see these blue dots are basically the
training set and these red dots are the test set and in the next step is learning the model
from the training set. So, once we created this division between the learning or training
set and the test set, let us use this training set to create a first model y equal to alpha plus
beta x.
So, this is our next step, the next step says estimate your future performance with the test
set. So, once we create a model now let us use our test set to use in this particular
relationship to predict and then let us estimate our future performance with the test set.
For example, if we have created a particular model for example, y equal to say for 3 x
plus 2.
So, here we will then input. So, this is our calibration model, now once you create this
calibration model let us input our validation data points or test set into this relationship
and get some values these will be predicted values. So, once we get the predicted values
we also know their original values, so let us make a relationship let us see how they areaccurate or not or let us make a relationship between the predicted and actual so this
relationship is called the validation relationship.
So, again once you create the trading model or calibration model then we will estimate
our future performance with the test set and then we will calculate the mean square error
by using this particular formula and then mean square error; obviously, and then we will
estimate our future performance. So, in this case our mean square a particular example
mean square error is 2.4. So, this is an example of the random holdout method.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:48)
Second is test set method so randomly choose again and this for quadratic function the
similarly just like we did for linear regression for this for quadratic regression, this is for
piece wise regression. And ultimately we will get an estimate of mean squared error you
can see in the first linear regression we are getting a mean squared error of 2.4 and in the
quadratic method we are getting mean squared error of 0.9 and in the test set in the
piecewise method we are getting a mean squared error of 2.2.
So, according to, you know, by come by seeing this result we can say that this quadratic
function shows the best fit of in the available data. Now; obviously, there are some
positive things and negative things in this test set method, the positive things are they are
very very simple and they can simply choose the method with the best test score and the
problem is there is wastage of data; that means, best model is estimated using only using
30 percent less data because we are using only 70 percent of the data.And if we do not have much data, our test set might be just lucky or unlucky because it
may be possible that that test set samples are completely different than that of our
calibration set and as a result of that there will be complete mismatch and the model
validation will produce very very poor results.
 (Refer Slide Time: 27:31)
So, advantage of this method is that it is usually I am sorry it is the previous method
holdout method we have not gone to our next method. So, the advantage of this method
is that it is usually preferable to the residual method and takes no longer to compute;
however, itâ€™s evaluation can have a high variance and the evaluation may depend heavily
on which data points end up in the training data set and which end up in the test set and
the evaluation may be significantly different depending on how division is made so it is
very very important.(Refer Slide Time: 28:02)
The second method is called the K fold cross validation; now K fold cross validation is
one way to improve over the hold out method. And the data set here is divided into k
subsets and the holdout method is repeated k times, in each time one of the k subsets is
used as a test set and the other k minus 1 subsets are put together to form a training set,
then the average error across all the k trials is computed. The advantage of this method is
that it matters less how the data gets divided and every data gets to be in the tests set
exactly once and gets to be in a training set k minus 1 times.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:44)
So, as you can see here this is an example of K fold cross validation and the K fold cross
validation let us divide for example, this is our total data set let us randomly break the
data set into k partition in our case let us do three partition and we denote them into red,
green and blue. And in the second step for the red partition let us use the; for the red
partition let us train all the points not in the red partition find the test sets comes square
error on the red points.
So, basically what we will do? Will use all the red, all the green points and the blue
points as our training points we will fit a training model and then we will produce then
we will see the error from the by using this red test cases. And in the next iteration we
will do the same using the green samples and the last step we will do the same using the
blue samples.
So, you can see in each of the step we are holding one particular set. In the first time we
are holding the red set, the second time we are holding the green set and the third time
we are holding the blue set as test set and we are using the rest of the two for creating a
calibration model and then we are producing, we are estimating the error. So, once you
complete all these three iteration we will have an average and then this will be our mean
and you know this will give us the mean validation performance.
(Refer Slide Time: 30:31)
So, this is about the K fold cross validation and the K fold cross validation says the
variance of the resulting estimator reduces k is increased and the disadvantage of thismethod is that training algorithm has to be rerun from scratch to k times which means it
takes k times as much as computation to make an evaluation. A variant of this method is
to randomly divide the data into a test set and a training set k different times and the
advantage of doing this is that you can independently choose over large, you know, large
each test set and it is how many trials we average over.
(Refer Slide Time: 31:02)
Then finally, one is leave one out cross validation; the leave one out cross validation is
another form of K fold cross validation, you know, where K equal to â€˜nâ€™ and basically
here what do we do for from the whole data set we select only one sample as a test
sample in each iteration and then for example, there are K if there is an N sample we will
select at each iteration we will select one sample as a test sample and then we will use
the rest N minus 1 sample as training sample.
And we will use this N minus 1 sample to create a calibration model and then we will
estimate the error using this one sample which we used for testing and then we will
repeat this for all the samples and ultimately we will predict the mean error from, you
know, by averaging all the errors from this each iteration.
So, you can see this leave one out cross validation we are leaving one out each time and
then we are creating a model and then we are estimating the error and this is an extension
of K fold cross validation. So, that is why it is called leave one out cross validation,
sometimes we will call it full cross validation also.(Refer Slide Time: 32:39)
 (Refer Slide Time: 32:33)
So, this is an overview of leave one out cross validation you can see and the selection
criteria in which case we will use which one. So, when there are a very few data to work
with; obviously, you will go with the leave one out cross validation. When we can
sacrifice a few data points; obviously, we will go with the random holdout or K fold.
However, in case of random sub setting, there is a chance of biasness because we do not
know in case of random subset which one sample will go to the test set and which
sample will go to the training set there could be complete mismatch. So, this is the
advantages and disadvantages of this method.(Refer Slide Time: 33:10)
And you can see here this is a MLR Multiple Linear Regression and this is a MLR
example of in digital soil mapping, here we regress a target variable against more than
one covariate and we use all the covariates and there are two ways we can do this
multiple linear regression we can use either all the covariates in as the predictor or we
can use stepwise linear regression as you can see this is a multiple linear regression
predicted soil organic carbon stock in 0 to 5 centimeter. So, this map is produced by
multiple linear regression.
(Refer Slide Time: 33:47)
And also this multiple linear regression can produce, not only it will give the prediction
for this 0 to 5 centimeter. You can see it also produces the lower limit of prediction.
(Refer Slide Time: 34:00)
And not only it gives the multiple, you know, the prediction for the soil organic carbon
stock for 0 to 5 centimeter, it also gives you the prediction interval that is lower limit of
prediction as well as upper limit of prediction. So, you get a sense of the uncertainty in
this in this DSM product.
So, guys let us stop here and we will start from here in our next lecture and we will try to
finish this continuous model and categorical model in our next lecture and I hope that
you have learned something new and in the next lecture we will talk about different types
of non linear models also.
Thank you very much.
