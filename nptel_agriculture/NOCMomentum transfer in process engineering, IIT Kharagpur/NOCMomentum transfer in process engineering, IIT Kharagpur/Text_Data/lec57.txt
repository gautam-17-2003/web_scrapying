Problem and solution (Continued)  
Yeah, so , we have done a problem let us do another problem and this solving problem will help 
you in assessing the situations that you have to keep in mind not only in mind the values will 
give you idea really if you are working in industry. So , that more and more problems you solve 
more and more you come across with the ideas with the real applications, right? So let us then do 
the similar problem.  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:04)  
 
A tubular heat exchanger and a plate heat exchanger is separately used to heat water. Diame ter of 
the tube is 15 millimeter. Gap in the plates is also 15 millimeter. Water has a viscosity of 1.2 into 
10 to the power minus 4 Pascal second and density of 1000 kg per meter cube.  For both the heat 
exchangers N Re is said to be 5000. What are the aver age velocity and pressure drops for the two 
cases, right? I think this we should change this should be R capital, so by mistake it was so R 
capital should be, right?  
So, in the previous one also it was there r but I did not change, so you please change th at r is 
capital, okay. So , we repeat, A tubular heat exchanger and a plate heat exchanger is separately 
used to heat water. Diameter of the tube is 15 millimeter. Gap in the plates is also 15 millimeter. 
Water has a viscosity of 1.2 into 10 to the power mi nus 4 Pascal second and density of 1000 kg 
per meter cube.  For both the heat exchangers N Re is said to be 5000. What are the average 
velocities and pressure drops for the two cases?  
If you remember , in this previous problem we also dealt with a similar on e and we said we saw 
rather that the it was for a juice and the property values where different a little may not be very 
widely different but different and we saw that tubular heat exchanger had higher velocity as well 
the pressure drop compare to those of  the plate heat exchangers, right? And this was true when 
the flow was not laminar but somewhere intermediate we took if we remember we took around 
3000 as the Reynolds number, but here we have taken Reynolds number to be 5000.  
So, it is no more that laminar flow that is what we have done for the previous one for pressure 
drop calculation, right? That Hagen Poiseuille delta P we cannot directly use, right? I hope you 
have by this time you have done many other problems solutions also , so here instead of Hagen 
Poiseuille some other formulation we have use and that I hope you have come across or you can 
understand or make out that what could be that, right?  
So, that is why,  in this case , I am, we are comparing or rather there can be a comparison between 
the fluid in the earlier case it was a juice and in this case it is water and viscosities and densities 
are also quite different, right? So that should also tell on both the velocities as well the pressure 
drops, right? Now let us look i nto how far really it is telling on the values, right?  (Refer Slide Time: 5:50)  
 
So, let us see that whatever has been told we have been said that for tubular heat exchanger the 
given things are diameter of the tube is 15 millimeter is equals to 15 into  10 to the power minus 3 
meter, right? Viscosity of the fluid or water mu w is 1.2 10 to the power minus 4 Pascal second, 
right? And Reynolds number given is 5000, right? And density that is rho of water given is 1000, 
right?  
So, since it is a pipe flow, flow through the pipe we can use directly use that relation of N Re is 
equals to D v rho by mu, right? So D is given as 15 10 to the power minus 3, v , we have to find 
out, rho is given 1100, mu we have not 1100 it is 1000 and mu we have 1.2 10 to the power 
minus 4 Pascal seconds, right? So , if that be true, then let us also take this that let us also take, 
okay v is equal to of course these are all v average, v average is equals to then N Re is 5000 into 
1.2 into 10 to the power minus 4 over 15 times 10 to th e power minus 3 times 1000, right? So , 
this has gone there v is there v average is so.  
So, let us look into how much it is, it is 5000 into 1.2 into 10 to the power minus 4 is so much 
divided by 15 divided by 1000 divided by 10 to the power minus 3 it is 0 .04 meter per second, if 
you remember when it was a juice to my memory it was much more than this, velocity was much 
more than this it was not 0.04 somewhere it is at least 4, 5 times greater than that, right? So , just 
check, okay. So , velocity has become so much and now let us look into the pressure drop, right?  
Now , since it is not the laminar flow and the flow is turbulent 5000 turbulent so , we need to 
apply  that relation where it is with the fanning friction factor. So , delta P is equal  to 4 f, right? 
Rho L by D v square by 2 if we remember correctly v average by 2, so this was the fanning 
friction factor, right? So , what we need from the fanning friction factor chart Moodyâ€™s chart that 
if you remember that we had said N Re versus f, right? That was give n for different epsilon value 
or epsilon by D these values where there and from the Moody's chart we can find out what is the 
value of f, right?  
Since we do not have here that Moody's chart let assume that corresponding to N Re equals to 
5000, right? The values  of f of course we need to know the epsilon by D the value of f say it can  
be 0.01, right? Let us assume it, then we can find out the value of delta P that 4 into 0.01 into rho 
is 1000 into L, L was given 10 meter if I remember let us look into, righ t? 5015 millimeter 
diameter of the tube same density this was, okay gap in the plates is so much, okay.  
Then so it is 1000 into 10 meter over into v average, right? L by D, D is 15 into 10 to the power 
minus 3, right? And this is 2 v average , v came out t o be 0.04 square, right? So , if we look at 
this, then we can see that 0.04 v square so it is square into 10 into 1000 into 0.01 into 4 is equal 
to divided by 15 divided by 2 divided by 10 to the power minus 3. So this came to be equal to 
21.33 Pascal, righ t? And just check corresponding to this velocity delta P for the turbulent flo w 
we have done for the laminar flow or intermediate when the flow is intermediate there we have 
found out that what is the value of pressure drop and what is the value of velocit y. 
Now , we have also found out of course the fluid is a different that is for water what is the value 
for this, right? If there is a little time we will go back to the previous problem and do this same 
for the pressure drop, because velocity for pipe flow will also more or less similar, okay. Now , 
for tubular heat exchanger it was like that, for plate heat exchanger if we look at that value N Re 
and this is case of course plate heat exchanger like the earlier one we say that this is the flow 
through slit thi s is flow through pipe and this is flow through slit, right? Because the gap is very 
small and it is moving through that, right?  
So, for plate heat exchanger we can write that N Re is equals to 4 del v rho by mu, so it is 4 and 
del same sorry del same 2 de l is 15 so del is 15 by 2 , i.e., 7.5 millimeter. So , we write 4 into 7.5 
into 10 to the power minus 3 into v we have already found out that is to be, v we have to find out, okay , so v into rho is 1000 divided by mu is 1.2 into 10 to the power minus 4. Ther efore v 
comes out to be NRe is 5000 into 1.2 into 10 to the power minus 4 divided by 4 into 7.5 into 10 to 
the power minus 3 into 1000, right?  
So, this comes out to be let us see how much it com es out, so , 5000 into 1.2, right, i nto 10 to the 
power minus 4 divided by 4 divided by 7.5 divided by 1000 divided by 10 to the power minus 3 
it is 0.02 it was in this case 0.04, in this case 0.02 meter per second, right? Now , the question 
comes for the delta P, right? What will be the delta P, now if we see that de lta P through the slit 
the expression for that it is again in this case this for the pipe it was assumed to be 0.01 now for 
the slit let the value of f from of course N Re versus f corresponding to that we can get value of f 
to be equals to say 0.015, right ?  
So, if it is like that, then we had earlier assumed it is 0.01 so let us say it is 0.015, right? So , then 
we get that delta P is equal to that 4 f rho, right? L by D v square average by 2, right? And this is 
of course not 4 f this was for pipe, so for s lit we write 2 f rho v average square, right? L divided 
by 2 into 2 del, right? So , this is what is for the flow through the slit. So , that comes to be 2 into 
0.015, right , into 1000 into v average we have found out 3.02 into L was 10 and this is 2 into 2 
del, 2 del is 15, right? So , 15 millimeter so 15 10 to the power minus 3, right?  
Now , if we look at this value calculate it then it comes to be say 2 t imes 0.015 times 1000, right, 
times 0.02 square times 10 is equal to this divided by 2 divided by 15 div ided by 10 to the power 
minus 3, right? So , that comes to be 4, right? This is equal to 4 Pascal, right? So , here it was 
again high, here it is low. Now I said that the two cases we have dealt with both for laminar as 
well turbulent, but I said that if we look at the previous problem where it was laminar or not 
laminar it was intermediate and in that intermediate the values of delta P and v what we got that 
was for the that was for your juice apple juice if I remember, right?  
Now , if we do the same for tur bulent one, for the apple juice let us look into how the value is 
different, right? Let us look for turbulent how the value is different, let me open that this was the 
problem, right?  (Refer Slide Time: 24:50)  
 
So, instead of 3000, okay. Let us do for t he yeah, so , what we get that for turbulent flow for 
tubular heat exchanger, right? N Re for apple juice apple sauce is equals to D v rho by mu and 
Rho of fluid and D was we have to find out v so v is N Re mu over D rho, right?  
So, NRe in this case 5000 mu it was 7 10 to the power minus 4, right? And D is D was 0.015 and 
rho was 1100, right? So , if we see what is the value, right? It is 5000 into 7 into 10 to the power 
minus 4 divided by 3.5 divided by 1100 it is 9 10 to the power minus  4 meter per second, right? 
So velocity has gone down, right? So , 5000 when the Reynolds number is so high 5000 so this is 
7 10 to the power minus 4, right? 0.015 and it is 1100 so 5000 into 17 rho minus 4 actually we 
might have done something wrong let us  look into once again it was 7 10 to the power minus 4 
viscosity, yes so the value should not go so low because Reynolds number has gone up so 5000 
into 7 into 10 to the power minus 4, right? Divided by 0.015 is equal to divided by 1100, 0.1 that 
is what n ot so this was wrong it is 0.12 meter per second, and if we look at what is the value? It 
was 0.127 so velocity has gone up, right? Similarly if we look at the pressure drop delta P, delta 
P was 4 f rho v square by 2 12 by D, right? And it was 4 f we took say, 0.01, right? Into 1100 
into v we got 0.212 square by 2 into L was 10 and D is 0.015, right?  
So if we look at that, then also we see this is 4 into 0.01 into 1100 into 0.212 square is equal to 
this into 10 so much divided by 2 divided by 0.015 is equal  to 659, so it is 659 Pascal, okay 0.17 
okay so 659 and if we look at what is the value for delta P, it was 126 Pascal. So that means 
when from laminar flow or it was not laminar intermediate, so when it is like that from 
intermediate to to the other one t hat is turbulent it went up the both the velocity and the pressure 
drop went very high, right? Thank you.
