Problem and solution (Continued)  
Okay, now we have been doing problems on different aspects, now another problem which is 
very, very useful that for Newtonian and Non -Newtonian fluids, right? We have done flow 
through Newtonian, flow through pipes, flow through slits for Newtonian fluids we have also 
done flow through pipes, flow through slits for Non -Newtonian fluids no and in the Non -
Newtonian fluid it flows the power law equation and there we have seen that the flow behavior 
and consistency coefficient or index indices they are having tremendous effect on the  flow 
characteristics, right?  
But, we also need to know the what could be the values which are normally we handle with, for 
example if is Newtonian fluid then the value of n is 1 and the viscosity is the k that is the 
consistency coefficient we call it to  be that viscosity, but if it is not Newtonian if it is Non -
Newtonian then both the consistency coefficient and the flow behavior index or indices this we 
must have some idea about the values, right? So , let us do also some problem to be solved or 
problem solution such that we have some idea on that, okay.  (Refer Slide Time: 2:43)  
 
 
So, let us look into this problem that, A fluid is flowing through a tube having an inside diameter 
0.008 meter and  a length of 0.3 meter at a flow rate of 5 into 10 to the power minus 5 meter 
cube per second and thereby induces a pressure drop of 1000 Pascal. Calculate , the apparent 
viscosity as defined as the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid which exhibit the same pressure drop 
as this fluid at the rate of flow through this t ube, this is 1.  
Then, if the flow rate of the fluid is 1 10 to the power minus 4 meter cube per second and the 
length of the tube is reduced to 0.2 meter keeping the same diameter induces a pressure drop of 
2000 Pascal. What will be the flow behavior and c onsistency indices of the fluid, right? So , if we 
reread the problem is like this, A fluid is flowing through a tube having an inside diameter of 
0.008 meter and a length of 0.3 meter.  
(Refer Slide Time: 4:26)  
 
So, inside diameter D is equal  to 0.008 me ter and length L is equal  to 0.3 meter, at a flow rate of 
5 10 to the power, so Q is equal  to 5 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter cube per second, thereby 
induces a pr essure drop, so, delta P is equal  to 1000 Pascal. Calculate , the apparent viscosity as 
defined as the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid which exhibit the same pressure drop as this fluid at 
the rate of flow through this tube.  
Second question, if the flow rate of the fluid is 1 into 10 to the power minus 4 meter cube p er 
second and the length of the tube is reduced, so L is 0.2 meter the same diameter (induce) 
keeping the s ame diameter that is D is equal  to 0.008 meter and indices a pr essure drop, so, delta 
P is equal  to 2000 Pascal, right? What will be the flow behavio r indices and the consistency 
induces of the fluid, right?  
So, this we have to do, so let us solve it now for solution I think you may have a little problem in 
this let me try, now from the Hagen Poiseuille’s equation which we know from the Hagen 
Poiseuil le’s equation which we know  that delta P is equal  to 32 mu v average L by D square, 
right? So this is the delta P, okay therefore from there we ca n write that v average is equal  to 
delta P D square by 32 mu L that can be written as delta P R square by 8 mu  L, right? So , if we 
call it to be equation number (1), right?  
Now , this equation can be used to determine the viscosity of Non -Newtonian fluid if the 
viscosity obtain will be apparent your viscosity this will be apparent viscosity and using a single 
rate of flow and in that case w e can say mu apparent is equal  to delta P R square by 8 v average 
into L, right?                 
So, given D is so much so R by 2 rather D is so much so is equal  to 2 R should not be R by 2 is 
equal to 2 R, right? So R is equal  to 0.004, right? So , if we write that value we can say that delta 
P given is 1000;  R is 0.004 square 8, right? Now , v average that can be fo und out from v average 
is equal  to flow rate has been given , i.e., Q over area , cross sectional area, right? So , if we say 
that this is  equal  to flow rate has been given Q , 5 10 to the power minus 3 meter cube per second 
and area is pi R square pi 0.004 square, right?  
So, this is we get so much meter per second, so , if we apply that 8 v average 8 v average is that 
so 8 into pi into 0.004 square, right? L, L given is 0.3 meter, right? So , we can write that this is 
into 0.3 and this is already done, this is so and here pi into did we do wrong, yes , we had done 
wrong , 1000 into 0.004 square by 8 v average is that so , into 5  into 10 to the power minus 3 in 
the denominator, right , into L is 0.3 into numerator is 5 and this is 0.004 square, okay.  
So, this comes to equal to let us look into that 1000 into 0.004 square this much into pi into 0.004 
square this much divided by 8 di vided by 5 divided by 10 to the power minus 3 divided by 0.3 is 
equal to 6.7 10 to the power minus 5 so much Pascal second, right? 6.7 10 to the power minus 5 
Pascal second, why it is 10 to the power minus 3 is coming here 10 to the power minus 3 it is pi 
0.004 square 5 10 to the power minus 3 meter cube per second this is meter square, so 1000 delta 
P 0.004 square pi into 0.004 square, fine by 8 v average is this 5 10 to the power minus 3 and L 
is 0.3.  
So, somewhere again we have done little wrong let us look into 0.004 square into 0.004 square is 
equal to this much into pi into 1000 this much divided by 8 divided by 5 divided by 0.3 divided 
by 10 to the power minus 3, yeah , it is coming 6.7 10 to the power  minus 5, right? So , perhaps 
we have done something wrong, v average is coming 0.995 , let us see once whether v average is 
coming 5 into 10 to the power minus 3, yeah , divided by pi divided by 0.004 square this is so 
99.47, so , that was something wrong it was done here is not 5 so there it is comes it is correct, 
okay.  So, mu apparent is so much, then next we what we have to find out is second case, first case we 
have been asked that what is the mu apparent, right? Apparent viscosity we have found out, now 
second case we have to do that v average second case we have to do v average this is equal to 1 
10 to the power minus 4 Q divided by pi into 0.004 square, right? This is equal to 1 into 10 to the 
power minus 4 this much divided by pi this much divided by 0 .004 square this so , 1.989 so , 1.99, 
right , meter per second.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:03)  
 
So, if it is so 1.99 meter per second, then we can write mu apparent, right? So , mu apparent how 
much it is coming for 2000 delta P into R square 0.004 square divided by 8 into v average, v 
average is 1.99 into L, L is 0.2 so this comes equal to 2000 into 0.004 square that is this much 
divided by 8 divided by 1.99 divided by 0.2, 0.01 00, right? 0.01005, right? So , much Pascal 
second so that can be said 1.005 into 10 to the power minus 2 Pascal second so mu apparent, 
right?  
Now , we can say that shear rate at the wall th at is at R is equal  to R the Newtonian fluid is minus 
dv / dr at th e wall is equal  to 4 v average over R, right? Whereas for a Non -Newtonian fluid 
whereas for a Non -Newto nian fluid mu apparent is equal  to K into gamma to the power n minus 
1 and minus dv  / dr at the wall is equal to v average into 3 n plus 1 over n into 1 by R that can be 
written as 4 v average divided by R into 3 by 4 plus 1 by 4 n, right?  
Or, we can say gamma at wall w is equal to 4 v average divided by R times shi, so, where we can 
say, shi is equal to 3 by 4 means 0.75 plus 1 by 4 means 0.25 over n, right? So mu apparent we 
can write to be k into 4 shi divided by R to the power n minus 1 v average to the power n minus 
1, right?  
(Refer Slide Time: 22:45)  
 
 
Now , if we use now if we use 1 an d 2 for subscript for velocity and corresponding apparent 
viscosity then this is at viscosity means at 5 10 to the power minus 5 meter cube per second and 
1 into 10 to the power minus 4 meter cube per second, right?  
So, for these two flow if we use 1 and 2 as its subscripts, then we can write that mu apparent 1 
over mu apparent 2 this can be written as K into del 4 shi by R to the power n minus 1 v average 
1 to the power n minus 1 divided by K 4 shi divided by R to the power n minus 1 v average 2 to 
the po wer n minus 1, right? So , this is nothing but v average 1 by v average 2 to the power n 
minus 1, right? So , if we take log in both the sides so , we can say log of mu apparent 1 over mu 
apparent 2 this is equal to log of v average 1 over v average 2 to the power n minus 1 or we can 
write substitute the values log of 6.7 10 to the power minus 3 divided by it is was 6.7 it was 6.7 
10 to the power minus 5 not minus 3, 6.7 10 to the power minus 5 and second one we got to be 
mu apparent 1.005 into 10 to the power  minus 2, right?  
This is equal  to n minus 1 log of v average is equal to that we have found out average v , this is in 
one case , we have gotten average v to be 1.99 in one case , and in other case we have seen here it 
to be 5 into 10 to the power minus 5 by  5 0.004 square, right? So , let us look into that 5 into 10 
to the power minus 3 square 3 plus minus is equal to divided by pi divided by 0.004 square. So , 
that is 99.47, right? 99.47 meter per second, right? So , that if we substitute here that log v 
average 1 was 99.47 over 1.99, right?  
So, we can say then 6.7 10 to the power minus 5, 6.7 into 10 to the power minus 5 is equal to this 
divided by 1.005 into 10 x to the power minus 2 this is equal to this, right? S o, log of 0.0066 is 
equal to n minus 1 into log of 99.47 by 1.99 is equal to 49.98, right? So , n minus 1 is equal to log 
of that means let us put that 49.98 log is this much divided by 0.0066 log is equal to minus 2.18, 
right? So , n is equal to this plus 1  minus 1.18 just check whether this value is correct or not, okay 
we will continue in the next class, thank you.
