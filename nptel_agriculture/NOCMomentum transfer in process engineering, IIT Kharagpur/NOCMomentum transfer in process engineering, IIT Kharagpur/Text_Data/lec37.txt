Problem on Pneumatic conveying Part-1 
We had  done  this  conveying,  right?  Pneumatic  conveying  and  now, with  this  pneumatic
conveying, we will do a problem because, a problem solution, and this problem will be, earlier,
we had said, that may, this for particularly compressible fluid, things are complicated, and your
expressions are bigger, so, it may, or may not be possible to do in a one shot, so there, it may be
required some trial and error or things like that. So, maybe this problem, we will handle and
there it may be required, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 1:19)
So, let us go to that, I think this is on 23, yes. So, the problem says like this, A granular material
is to be conveyed pneumatically in a line of 15 cm diameter and 130 meter long at a rate of 2000
kg per hour. The discharge end of the line will be open to atmosphere, 25 meter above the feed
point. And it is intended to retain a 12:1 solid to air mass ratio. If, under the operating condition
the factor alpha, you remember, we had said that this alpha, we had taken as factor multiplied
with all losses, frictional losses, everything, and we said this alpha maybe given, or may not be
given, sometimes you may find out, sometimes it might have been given.
So, in this typical problem, alpha has to be found out. So, the factor alpha has a value of 6, this is
given, what pressure will be required at the feed point? Assume friction factor as 0.006 andtemperature to be 20 degree centigrade, right? So, I repeat, A granular material is to be conveyed
pneumatically in a line of 15 cm diameter and 130 meter long at a rate of 2000 kg per hour. The
discharge end of the line will be open to atmosphere, 25 meter above the feed point. And it is
intended to retain a 12:1 solid to air mass ratio. If, under the operating condition the factor alpha
has a value of 6, what pressure will be required at the feed point? Assume friction factor as 0.006
and 20 degree centigrade as the temperature, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 4:08) 
Now, let us look into the solution of this problem. From the given problem, it is coming that the
diameter of this is D is equal to 15 centimeter is equal to 0.015 meter, right? Height of this is z or
delta z, whatever we call, that is given as 25 meter, so height is equal to 25 meter, right? And the
rate of the mass flow rate, m dot is equal to 2000 kg per hour, right? And this solid to air ratio,
this is 12:1, then friction factor is 0.006, and temperature is equal to 20 degree centigrade that
means, 273 plus 20 is equal to 293 Kelvin, right? 
So, if that be true, m dot is given, so, mass flow rate is given, we can write G, right? G as 2000
kg per hour, right? That can be written as 2000 divided by area that is kg per hour so we can
write, 3600 as kg per second into area pi by 4 D square, D is 0.015, not 15 centimeter, then, it is
0.15 not 0.015, so, it is 0.15 meter, that should be clear, right? 15 centimeter is 0.15 meter, this is
square, right? And this comes to equal to, let us look into that calculator, okay, so, 2000 divided
by 3600 divided by pi by 4, okay, is equal to this divided by 0.15 square is equal to 31.438,
right? So, so much kg per meter square per second, right? This is the mass velocity, G. So, that, we said
earlier that, mass velocity, rho v; G is equal to rho v, so that we got 31.438 this thing, right?
Okay. Now, RT by M, this is equal to, R, is 8314 into this is 293, molecular weight of air is not
given, so, assume molecular weight of air to be 29, so, by 29, this comes to equal to 8314 into
293 is equal to this, divided by 29 is equal to 84000.06 or 0.07, so, so much joules per kg or
meter square second square, so is or this is joules per kg, this meter square second square, joules
per kg, this conversion, we had done in one of the earlier problems, if you remember, and we
showed, how this is convertible in terms of unit, that we had done, right? We are not re-doing
here, okay.
Now, if this is true, that 84000, of so much, now, some other are required, GRT over M square is
equal to this G is 31.438 into R, 8314, RT by M, so RT by M is 84000, let us ignore the other
one, right? So, this square divided by 2, so, this becomes equal to, let us look into how much it
becomes, so it is 31.43 into 84000, this square, that is square divided by 2, so, that comes equal
to 3485116807200, so, is equal to 3.48 into 10 to the power 12, right? So, that is what 3.48 10 to
the power 12, so much joules square per meter square per second square.
So, this will be meter to the power 4, right? Joules square because, this GRT, that was joule per
kg, right? This is kg, G is kg per meter square per second into RT by M that was joules per kg,
so, this square this is equal to this kg, kg goes out, this joules remains, so, becomes, joules square
per meter to the power 4 second square, right? So, that is what it is coming, okay. 
Now, let us look into the third one that is what next, next is we have been given the pressure,
right? We have been given the pressure, one inlet pressure is given, what outlet pressure, we have
to find out, that is what exactly, we have been given that and length also in this case, we, total
height was so much, so, if there would have been like this, so, total length was 130 meter, right?
And pressure was given, alpha was given, is equal to 6, and pressure will be at, I can remember
the problem, material; conveyed pneumatically in a line at a rate of so much, and the discharge
end of the line will be open to atmosphere, and what we have to find out, what pressure will be
required to the feed point, okay.
So, this discharge end is atmospheric pressure, so, it is 1 atmosphere, and here the pressure p
inlet, how much has to be found out, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 15:18)If, that be true, then let us then find out, what is the value of 1 plus alpha, 1 plus S, so, it was 1
plus S plus 4 alpha f L by D, what is the value of this? This is 1 plus S, is given 12:1, so, 12 plus
4 alpha is 6, L is, alpha L is given as L by D, okay. So, L is given as this, 4 into alpha into f, f is
given 0.006, right, into L is given 130 meter by D is given 0.15, right? This we can write like
this, right? 4 alpha f so this.
So, this is equal to 1 plus 12 that is 13 already, so let us look into how much, what is that again,
we have taken out, so 4 into 6 into 0.006 into 130 divided by 0.15, right? So much plus 12 plus 1
is equal to 137.8, right? 137.8, right? 137.8. So, this, if we take other value is 1 plus S into g into
z1 minus z2, that was equal to 1 plus 12 is, g is, 9.81, right, into 9.18 into z 2 minus z1, that is
given, or this is z1 minus z2, so, against the gravity, so 25 meter, it was given, so, into 25, right?
This becomes equal to how much? 1 plus 12 is equal to this into 9.8181, sorry, so 9.81 into 25
plus minus is equal to minus 3188.25, right? 
So, that is what we got, 1 plus S. Now, let p 1 by p2, that is equal to 1, right? Then, we get left
hand side, the equations we had given earlier in the previous class is 0 plus 0 minus 3188.25,
right? So, if it is 1, then this becomes 0, 0 into 0 plus 0 minus 3188.25, so this is less than 0,
right? This is less than 0, so, let another p 1 over p2, so this to be 1.2, right? Then, left hand side of
the equation, this becomes equal to how much? 
(Refer Slide Time: 21:01)If, we go back to, I hope the equation we need to write somewhere, right? So, we had equation,
let us write here, this is RT by M ln of p 1 over p2 plus 1 plus S plus 4 alpha f L by D, right, into
GRT square divided by 2 M square, right? This times 1 minus 1 by P 1 whole square minus 1 by
p2 square, right? This plus 1 plus S into g into z 1 minus z2, this is equal to 0. So, this is the
equation, this was the equation, which we have to do.
So, RT by M ln p1 by p2 plus 1 plus S 4 alpha f L by D into GRT square by 2 M square, right, into
1 by p1 square minus 1 by p 2 square plus 1 plus S g z 1 minus z2 that is equal to 0, right? So, in the
first case, we said left hand side is equal to p 1 by p2 that is ln 1 so 0, and this p 1 is equal to p2, so,
this goes off, right? So, this was also 0 and we had the third term this one, this we found out to
be minus 3188.25, so, it was this, it is less than 0, right? 
Now, if we assume p 1 by p2 is 1.2, then what we get? We have RT by M is 8400, so RT by M is
8400, ln of 1.2 plus 1 plus S plus 4 alpha f L by D, so, this we got here is minus 3, right? 1 plus S
plus 4 alpha f L by D, no, no, this is, 137.8, right? So, 137.8, right, into GRT by M square, so, by
2 GRT by M square, this whole thing we got 3.48 into 10 to the power 12, right? So, this is 10 to
the power 12, and this becomes 1 by p 1 square minus 1 by p 2 square. So, we have taken p 1 is
equal to 1.2 p2, right? So, 1 by p1 square minus 1 by 1.2 square p 2 square, right? 
So, if that be true, then, we get minus 3188.25, that was the last term, right? So, if we take p 1
square out, then we can write left hand side is equal to 8400 ln of 1.2, so, 8400 ln of 1.2, 1.2 ln is
this, into 84000, right? So, it was like that, which came 84000 from here, right? So, this becomes
equal to 15315, 15315 plus 137.8 into 3.48 10 to the power 12, right? So 3.48 into 10 to the
power 12 is equal to this into 137.8, 137.8, right, is equal to so much, if we take this is equal to4795440, right, into, if we take 1 by p 1 square common, then it becomes 1 minus 1 by 0.2 square,
right, minus 3188.25, right? 
So, 1 minus 1 by 1.2 square is how much? 1.2 square inverse of that is this, plus minus this plus
1 is equal to 0.3, so 0.30 into that 479544 into 10 to the power 9, right? So, much plus 15315 is
equal to this, right, minus 3188, we have written right 3188, yes, 3188.25 is equal to some value
is equal to, it has come 1465273334560, right? Which is greater than 0, right? So if this is like
that, this means this has come like that and our values are like that which is greater than 0, if we
take that this has become 1 minus 1 by 1.2 square p 1 is 1.2 p2, right? This was done p 1 is 1.2 p2,
so, that should have been p 1 is 1.2 p2, right? 
So, we should have written here, 1.2 square p 2 and this is p2 and then this should come out and
our this value should have been 1.2 square inverse of that minus 1, so this is equal to minus 0.03,
right? So, that means the whole term, so irrespective of the values, so, this is a value of A and
this becomes value of say negative, B minus a value of negative C, A is less than B plus C, so it
is a negative, some value, right? Which means it is also less than 0, right? 
So, we have taken two trials, one is p 1 by p2 is 1, second is p1 by p2 is 1.2 and in both the cases,
we saw that the expression left hand side whatever, we had, that is less than 0, that means we can
have p1 by p2 higher than 1.2, okay. We will do in the next class, time is not there, thank you.
