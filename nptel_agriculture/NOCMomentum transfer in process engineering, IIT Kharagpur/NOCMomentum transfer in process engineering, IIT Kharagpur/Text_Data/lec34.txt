Variable fluid flow-problems and solutions 
So, we have seen that what are variable flow, and how much time it takes for the pressure to drop
from an initial pressure to a final given pressure. And, we also said that, this will be under critical
pressure ratio condition, right, p 0 by p will be 0.528, till the pressure p by p a increases to the level
that p equal to 1 by 0.528, i.e., 1.894 atmosphere, it reaches the 1.894 atmosphere, till it reaches
that value, it will be under critical pressure ratio condition, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 1:26)
So, if we do a problem on it like this that, A nozzle of 20 millimeter diameter releases air from an
air reservoir to the atmosphere. Initial pressure and temperature of air are 6 atmosphere and 20
degree centigrade respectively. Volume of the reservoir is 20 cubic centimeter. If Cd is 0.928,
molecular weight is, this should be capital M, molecular weight is 28.97, gamma is 1.3, how long
will it take to lower the pressure to 3 atmosphere? Right? 
So, this is our problem, so from 6 atmosphere to 3 atmosphere, how long it will take? So, I
repeat, for the benefit of students, A nozzle of 20 millimeter diameter decreases air, sorry,
releases air from an air reservoir to the atmosphere. Initial pressure and temperature of air are 6
atmosphere  and  20  degree  centigrade  respectively.  Volume  of  the  reservoir  is  20  cubiccentimeter. If coefficient of discharge Cd is 0.98, molecular weight of air is 28.97, heat capacity
ratio is 1.3 or gamma is 1.3, how long it will take to lower the pressure to 3 atmospheres? Right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 3:56)
Now, this we can solve very easily, because we have seen in the previous class that the relation
was t is equal to vc under root K2 over K1 ln of p1 by p2, right? So, if p1 is the initial and p 2 is the
final, right? So, if that be true, we also said that K 1 is equal to K1 rather it is equal to, we had said
to be equal to K1 K2 so, that was in the other page, yeah, K 1 was Cd A0 under root 2 gamma by
gamma minus 1 times p 0 or p1 over p2, initial is p1 and final is p2, so in this case we should write
that p, okay, p1 by p2 as we are writing here to the power, this is under critical condition, right? 
This to the power point 2 by gamma or rather 2 by gamma minus p 1 over p2 to the power gamma
plus 1 by gamma under critical condition, this was K 1, right? And, since, the values, which are
given to us are like this, Cd is 0.95, 0.98, not 95, then, molecular weight M is given as 28.97,
then, we are given gamma to be 1.3, we are given p 1 is equal to 6 atmosphere, you are given p 2 is
equal to 3 atmosphere, and also we are given the volume of the container v c is equal to 20
centimeter cube, right? 
So, these are the values we are given, then, also we were given a nozzle of diameter, i.e., D nozzle is
equal to 20 millimeter, right? So, 20 millimeter diameter is equal to 20 into 10 to the power
minus 3 meter, right? So, if we substitute, then Cd is 0.98, A 0 is pi by 4 Dnozzle square, i.e., 20 into
10 to the power minus 3 whole square into under root 2 gamma 2 into 1.3 by 1.3 minus 1 times
this ratio is under critical, so 0.528 to the power 2 by 1.3 minus 0.528 to the power 1.3 plus 1
divided by 1.3, right? This was our K, now if we see this in the calculator, what we can see that, yeah, so, we have 0.98
into pi divided by 4 into 20 into 10 to the power minus 3 whole square into 20 into 10 to the
power minus 3, this my mistake, okay, let us do this first 20 into 10 to the power minus 3, okay,
whole square, this is the square, right, into 0.98 into pi into, say, 1 is equal to this much by 4 is
this side, right? Now, what about under root? So, let me also write it otherwise, 15393804002,
how come it is so, somewhere again something has been made wrong, how, come it is 10 to the
power minus 3 whole square, so it cannot be that.
So, it is 20 into 10 to the power 3 plus minus is equal to this, now this square is this into pi by 4
into pi into 0.98 is equal to this divided by 4 is equal to this, right? And, now this into, so, this we
can write, this was 3.0787 into 10 to the power minus 4, right, times this factor, say, this is A,
right? So, now what is A? Already we have made into, so, we can write here 1, 2 in the second,
we can write, or it can be third, 2 into 1.3, right, divided by 1.3 minus 1, i.e., 0.3 divided by 0.3,
right? So, this into first bracket that is 0.528 to the power 2 divided by 1.3, right, minus again
0.528 to the power 1.3 plus 1, i.e., 2.3, divided by 1.3, something wrong 1.3 hopefully we have
done wrong 9.4 which is not true.
So, let us see this second part, second part was 0.528 to the power 2 by 1.3 2 by 1.3, so, this was
this, right, minus 0.528 to the power 2.3 divided by 1.3, this 1, this 2, right, into or, we can make
is equal to, my goodness, we are making something wrong repeatedly, So, it is 0.528 to the
power 2 by 3, so that becomes 2 by 1.3, pardon me for this, to the power 2 by 1.3 is, this is equal
to this, right, minus, again 0.528 to the power, what 2.3 divided by 1.3, this again, second
bracket, and this is equal to, right, 0.05, that is what should have been, fine, into 2 into 1.3
divided by 1.3 minus 1, i.e., 0.3, this, so, this is this, right, into we have 3.0787 into 10 to the
power minus 4 this is coming 1.3 10 to the power minus 4, 1.368, 10 to the power minus 4, this
check, whether this is correct or not, okay.
K2 is coming to be equal to M by RT, M is given here as 28.97, R is 8314, and T is 20 degree
centigrade, which we have not written T is 20 degree centigrade, that is equal to 20+273, so, 293
Kelvin. So, 293 Kelvin, so, this is equal to 28.97 divided by 8314 divided by 293, so, this is
equal to 1.18, right? This is equal to 1.18924 10 to the power minus 5 K 2, right? And therefore,
the time t we can write from here, time t is equal to v c is given, this is 20 centimeter cube, 20 into
10 to the power minus 2, right, minus 3 somewhere, this we made wrong here, okay, square that
was square, but this v c, 20 into 10 to the power minus 3, minus 2 meter cube, right? So, into 3, that is it that, what it should be, right? And, this is that t, okay K 2 is 1.185 10 to the
power minus 5 185, not 9, okay, 5 10 to the power minus 5 by K 1, K1 we got 1.368 10 to the
power minus 4, right? ln of p 1 by p2, p1 is 6 initial, final is 3, right? So, if this is true, than we can
write that, vc is 10 20 centimeter cube, so, 10 to the power minus 2 or minus 6, so, rightly, we
write, it to be 10 to the power minus 6 meter cube. So, 20 10 to the power minus 6 meter cube,
that if we write, if we put it here, then, we get 10 to the power minus 6 into 20, right? 
So, this much meter cube is volume v c, K1 is 1.185, into 1.185 into 10 to the power minus 5,
right? So this divided by K 2, that was K2 and this is K1, 1.368 into 10 to the power minus 4, this
is divided by, so is equal to this divided by 10 to the power minus 4, so, this is equal to this
much, right, times 6 by 3, i.e., 2 ln of 2 times 1.73 times 2 ln what is ln, yeah, 1.7324 10 to the
power minus 6, right, times 2 ln, right? I again think we have done wrong, 10 to the power minus
6, yeah, we again done wrong, perhaps, so, it should be 1.713 10 to the power minus 6 plus
minus, right? Actually, we are not so much used, 1.713 into 10 to the power minus 6 plus minus
this, right, into, let it be like this, 2 of ln, ln of 2 is this, so into this is 1.1873 10 to the power
minus 6 somewhere, we have done something perhaps wrong.
However, this comes to 174.3 second, right? So, this comes to 174.3 seconds, so, when we make
it here, we see that the thing where we have done wrong is K 1 is given as Cd pi by 4 D square,
okay, into under root 2 gamma by gamma minus 1, p by p 0, p0 by p to the power 2 by gamma
minus p0 by p to the power gamma plus 1 by gamma, so this comes to 2.0528 10 to the power
minus 4, please check whether it is correct or not, right? 
Then, K2 as it is M by RT, which we also got the same, 28.97 by 8314, right, 8314.34, that you
can take, into 293, that comes to be 1.18519 10 to the power minus 5, right? And, thereby, we get
time t is vc under root vc into under root K 2 by K1 times ln of p1 by p2, right? Now, vc, here, the
difference is not 15 and 20, this 15 this 15, was perhaps 20 cubic centimeter, so, that is why our
thing was coming so low, 20 cubic centimeter, we had taken, but here in the problem, actually,
we have taken 15 meter cube, right? 15 meter cube into this root K 2 that under root 1.18519 10 to
the power minus 5, it was so divided by K 1, i.e., 2.0528 10 to the power minus 4 ln of 6 by 3 p 1
over p2, or, p0 by p, this should not be p 0 by p, this is p1 by p2, in that t expression which we got
earlier, right? Here, perhaps this p 1 by p2, okay.So, got ln of 6 by 3, this on simplification gives 174.3, so, the change is here 15 meter cube
instead of 20 cubic centimeter, if we take 20 cubic centimeter, perhaps, whatever we were getting
that should come, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 29:31)
However, this is a, this is only a calculation, which you can do it with your calculator, not like
this online, where lot many other difficulties are there, please check and here in the problem let
me also change here that will be better, that instead of 20 centimeter cube, let me write 15 cubic
centimeter, right? So, then only we can say that this is what is coming that cubic 15 cubic
centimeter, then only this is coming 15 times v c is 15, 15 times this over this K 2 by K1, root K2 by
K1 ln of 6 by 3, then it is 174.3, okay, this also you practice, and hopefully, we can do as many
problems we can come across, and you also do some practice with other problems, okay. Thank
you.
