Problems and solution for flow through flat plates or slits
So, with homogenization, we said that we will derive how the velocity profile and other profiles
are getting changed, or how can we find out the average velocity, or instantaneous velocity, or
maximum velocity, things like that, okay. So, let us look into that. So, it will be like this, just a
minute, one more yeah, so, here it is, we have done this, right? And then we have found out this
velocity profile, average velocity, and we also have found out what is the relation between
fanning friction factor and delta P, right? This also we have found out, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 1:30)
Then, we can say, now, up to this we had finished, delta P was 4 f, instead of 4 f, we had said let
us, for pipe flow, delta P was f rho L by 2 delta into v average, right? L by 2 delta into v average. So, if
that was there, then what we do, we take this v average square, this 2 f rho, right, L by 2 delta v average
square by 2. This way we can write that 2 f rho L by 2 delta and v average square by 2, right? Similar
to the pipe flow that was 4 f rho, then L by D then, v average square by 2, right? This was there for
delta P versus f relation, right? 
Now, if we substitute this for v average, then we can write “f” is equal to 2 delta P delta by, this was
for pipe flow, this is this is for slit, okay. So, if we substitute them 2 delta P delta by L rho v average
square, right, is equal to 2 into 3 mu L v average delta over delta square L rho v average square, right?This is equal to 6 mu by delta rho v average which can be written equal to 24 by 4 del rho v average
divided by mu, now this is equal to 24 by N Re, right?
So, then, for slit we see that, it is 24 by N Re, f is 24 by NRe, for pipe, we have seen it was 16 by
NRe, right? So, this was for pipe, so this f is related for your slit flow, this is 24 by N Re, right? So,
the difference is that, in the pipe flow we had N Re equal to D vaverage rho by mu, this was for pipe
flow, whereas, for slit flow N Re is equal to 4 delta rho v average divided by mu, right? So, this is the
difference, this is for slit flow, this is the basic difference, right? And corresponding f tend to be
16 by NRe, and corresponding f tend to be 24 by N Re, right?

So, once we know this, then we can do a problem like this. A plate heat exchanger is used to
sterilize apple juice. The gap between the plates is 10 millimeter and of 3 meter long. Assume
density and viscosity of apple juice to be 1060 kg per meter cube and 1 into 10 to the power
minus  4 Pascal second respectively. What is the average velocity and pressure drop if the
Reynolds number is 1200, right? So, I repeat the problem, this problem says that, A plate heat
exchanger is used to sterilize apple juice. The gap between the plates is 10 millimeter and of 3
meter long. Assume density and viscosity of apple juice to be 1060 kg per meter cube and 1 into
10 to the power minus 4 Pascal second respectively, then what is the average velocity and
pressure drop if the Reynolds number is 1200, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 7:07)Now, from here, we see that, the Reynolds number is given. Solution of the problem, that
Reynolds number is given equal to 4 delta v average into rho by mu, right? Therefore, we can write
vaverage is equal to NRe into mu divided by 4 delta, sorry, 4 delta into rho, right? So, what is given
here, 2 delta is equal to 10 millimeter, right? Therefore, we can write, v average 2 delta is equal to 10
millimeter. Other property values, what we have seen, they are your, mu is equal to 1 into 10 to
the power minus 4, right? 1 into 10 to the power minus 4 Pascal seconds, and rho, density is
given as 1060 kg per meter cube, right?
So, we put them and also given N Re is equal to 1200, right? So, we put N Re is 1200 into 1 into 10
to the power minus 4 is the mu divided by 4, right? 2 delta is 10 millimeter. So, delta is equal to
5 millimeter. So, 4 into 5 into rho, i.e., 1060, so how much it comes, let us look into, how much it
comes, i.e., 1200 into 10 to the power minus 4 divided by 20, 4 into 5 is 20, divided by 1060,
right? Is this much, and that divided by 10 to the power 4 so, it is 5.66. 5.66 10 to the power
minus 6 meter per second, right? 
Let us put it down, so, it is okay okay. If we change, a little change, a little in the sense, say, in
the value, we change this to perhaps, that was a, we change this value to 3, right? Then, how it is
coming? 
(Refer Slide Time: 11:05)How, it is coming? It is coming N Re vaverage is equal to 1200 into 1 into 10 to the power minus 3
divided by 4 into 4 into 5, right? 5 millimeter, right? 
So, that we forgot, 5 into 10 to the power minus 3, right, into 1060, right? So, 10 to the power
minus 3, this 10 to the power minus 3 goes out, right? These 5 fours are 20, okay. Let us put
directly there. 1200 divided by 20 divided by 1060, so, it is 0.056, yeah. 0.056 meter per second,
right? So, that is what, here also we got, but in the problem it was shown 10 to the power minus
4 that is why it was coming erroneous, okay.(Refer Slide Time: 12:42)
Now, this is average velocity, so what about delta P? delta P is 3 v average mu L divided by delta
square, right? So, this is 3 into 0.056, mu is 1 into 10 to the power minus 3 and L is given 3
meter long into 3 divided by delta square, delta is 5 into 10 to the power minus 3 square, right?
So, if we do this, we can see that, it is coming. If we do this we can see that, what it is coming, 3
into 0.056, 0.056 into 10 to the power minus 3 into 10 to the power 3 plus minus sorry, I made
mistake.
So, 3 into 0.056, 0.056 into 10 to the power minus 3, 10 raise to the power 3 plus minus, so, it is
that into 3 into 3 this is equal to that divided by 5 into 10 to the power minus 3, 10 to the power
minus 3 this square, right? So, that means this is 20.16 is equal to 20.16 delta P, so much Pascal,
right? So, that is what we are also getting here, right? Though, this means, if we do some
problems, if we do some solutions, then obviously, we come across with the formulae in more
close way, and you can solve the problems and figure out what is the value, these values also, we
should know, here delta P is around 20.16 Pascal, right? 
So, normal pressure is 101, right, 101.325 kilo Pascal. So, in that case, this is so much, that delta
P, pressure drop is not very high, okay.(Refer Slide Time: 16:03)
So, let us look into another problem, this problem says, whole milk is heated in a tubular heat
exchanger having a diameter of 10 millimeter. The Reynolds number is 5000. The density and
viscosity of whole milk is 1030 kg per meter cube and 2.12 into 10 to the power minus 3 Pascal
second  respectively. Calculate  the  average  velocity  of  milk  and  pressure  drop  in  the  heat
exchanger of 3 meter long.
I repeat, whole milk is heated in a tubular heat exchanger having a diameter of 10 millimeter.
The Reynolds number is 5000. The density and viscosity of whole milk is 1030 kg per meter
cube and 2.12 into 10 to the power minus 3 Pascal second respectively. Calculate the average
velocity of milk and pressure drop in the heat exchanger of 3 meter long, right? (Refer Slide Time: 17:19)
So, the solution, then this can be that average velocity, this is equal to N Re mu over D into rho,
right? So, it had been given, having a diameter of 10 millimeter, so, 10 millimeter diameter is
already given, like the previous one, where it was 2 delta equal to 10 millimeter, right? 
So, this can be, and here given are, diameter D is equal to 10 millimeter, right? And Reynolds
number NRe is equal to 5000, right? And density equals to 1030 kg per meter cube and viscosity,
mu is given as 2.12 into 10 to the power minus 3 Pascal second, right? As well, the heat
exchanger has a length, L is equal to 3 meter, right? So, then from here, what we can write, we
can write, the Reynolds number to be 5000, mu to be 2.12 into 10 to power minus 3, then D
given as 10 millimeter. So, 10 into 10 to power minus 3 this will give, if we just change, we did
not do this change of millimeter to meter. So, these are, be careful, when being done and this is
density 1030, right? 
So, from this, we can calculate, and say that how much, unless you do with calculator on your,
you do not find out the mistakes. Normally, we do, right? 5000 into 2.12, 2.12 into 10 to the
power minus 3, 10 to the power minus 3, so, it is so much divided by 10 divided by 1030 divided
by 10 to the power minus 3.
So, this is equal to 1.03, say two lines mean, 3, 1.03 meter per second, right? Hopefully, we also
got there similar. So, 1.029, give a 3 meter per second, right? So, now, what we need to know
that, corresponding to this, because, here you see from the problem given, what we understand
that whole milk is heated with a tubular heat exchanger.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:50)So, one milk, tubular, one, over other, so, like that annular which is shown in the morning, so,
this is one heat exchanger, right? And that is another, right? 
So, one fluid is moving, say this way in a tubular heat exchanger, it has not been said, whether co
current are counter current, generally we take in the counter current. So, having a diameter of 10
millimeter, so, tubular heat exchanger, diameter of 10 millimeter, so, in this it is being heated,
now, the Reynolds number is 5000, the density, viscosity has this much, calculate the average
pressure and the velocity. Now, when we have taken diameter and length in the previous sections
or, previous classes, we had said that, whenever you have such a thing, where, N Re is given, you
do not know the friction factor, then, you find out it from the Moody’s chart, right? 
The Moody’s chart was what, like that, there, we log-log graph, right? This f versus N Re and
corresponding to this, epsilon by D, has to be found out. So, what is the epsilon by D, that can be
taken  in  this  case,  epsilon  separately  not  given,  but  let  us  take  that,  this  epsilon  by  D
corresponding to that, and N Re to be 5000 the corresponding, f value, you can achieve, say
around 0.011, right? So, if assume, 0.011 to be to be f value, then, delta P is equal to 4 f rho L by
D vaverage square by 2, right? That is normal pipe flow, right? 
And if that be true, then you can write, this is 4 into 0.011 into, L is given 3, and D is given 10,
right? So, 10 millimeter is 10 raise to minus 3 meter and v average, which you have found out, is
1.03 square by 2, right? So this comes equal to, let us look into that calculator, so, what is
coming that 4 into 0.011, 4 into 0.011, right, into 3 , right, into, so, 4 f L, okay, into point 1.03
whole square, into 1.03 square. So, this is that divided by 10 divided by 2 divided by 10 to the
power minus 3, right? 10 to the power minus 3.So, this becomes equal to 7.00194, that means, 7.002, right? So, much of Pascal, let us look into
this as 6.543, why 6.543? Because, you must have done, some mistake somewhere, so, 4 f was
0.011 in to, we have not taken density, i.e., what is, so, 7.002, into 1030 if we make 7.002 into
1030. So, this becomes equal to 7211, that means 7.2 kilo Pascal, right? This becomes 7.212 kilo
Pascal, right? We hope, there also 6.543, the reason being, the difference is here, we have taken
0.011, right? Whereas, in this case, it has been taken as 0.1.
So, that is the fundamental difference, why this 6.543 is coming and we have got 7.212, right? 1
point, and here, also we have taken 1.03, they have taken 1.029 square. So, for which the value is
obviously, a little less, right? But, the thing is, like that, when you have these values, and when
you have here, you see, though it was pipe flow, though it was problem, where it was not
explicitly said that it is a pipe flow, right? It is said that whole milk is heated in a tubular heat
exchanger, and as I showed that, tubular heat exchanger is like this, right? So, in which, one fluid
is entering from the inner and another through the annular, so that is the annular heat exchanging
is happening. So, the way it is said, it appears that the milk is appearing, going through the inner
one, right? So, heating medium is not said, that is a heating medium. Now, when it is said, it is
also said that, if the flow is such that N Re is 5000, right? And also it is said that it is the fluid
milk, which has a density of 1030 and viscosity, 2.12 length which, it is passing is L, that is 3
meter, right? 
Viscosity is 2.12 into 10 to the power minus 3 Pascal second. Now, consequently it came to the
mind that, which shall we do, since it is a simple pipe flow, so, we have taken pipe flow relation
for that, and in the pipe flow, we could have also used Hagen–Poiseuille’s equation, but, the
moment you take a Hagen–Poiseuille equation, you will see the difference between Hagen–
Poiseuille, and using the fanning friction, there is a difference.
So, 5, 10 percent difference, what we will get, what will be that. So, we have taken that fanning
friction relation, with the delta P, and that fanning friction relation, with the delta P, the moment
you put it, so, this becomes a simple pipe flow and the delta P with the fanning friction factor,
whatever is coming. So, this way if you practice some more problems, from different sources,
and solve them then, I hope, more and more confidence level you will gain, and you can do and
solve very easily, okay thank you.
