Problems and solution of Non Newtonian fluid -Part -2  
Okay, I hope you have tried with at home that problem which was given, right? And if you could 
have solved it extremely well, but for all students who tried or could not do it for the benefit of 
those students let us also do this in this class, right? So , let us s ee what has been given and what 
we have to find out, right?  
(Refer Slide Time: 0:58)  
 
 
So, for that we read that problem , that two Non Newtonian fluids such as 50 percent 
concentrated milk so milk we have been given 50 percent concentrated and having a d ensity of 
rho is equals to 1030 kg per meter cube, right , applesauce having a density of 1100 kg per meter 
cube, right? So let us write rho milk and rho apple, right , are being pumped through a pipe 
having a diameter 10 meter 10 millimeter. So diameter of the pipe is 10 millimeter or is equals to 
10 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter, right?  
So, D is 10 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter, right? And the length of the pipe L is equal to 10 
meter, consistency and flow behavior indices for applesauce are that  is consistency coefficient is 
0.5 Pascal second to the power n and flow behavior index n is equal to 0.7, right? And for milk 
this k say apple , n apple k milk is equal to 30 Pascal second to the power n and flow behavior 
indices nm is 0.6 . Reynolds number  for the two cases are , Reynolds numbers are 500 and 5000 
for both the liquids, so , NRe equals to 500 and 5000 for both the liquids. Calculate , the average 
velocity, so , what we have to find out is v average , how much the pressure drop , delta P is how 
much, right?  
So, if we again read out, two Non Newtonian fluids such as 50 percent concentrated milk that is 
one Non Newtonian fluid having density of 1030 kg per meter cube and applesauce having 
density of 1100 kg per meter cube are being  pumped through a pipe having a diameter of 10 
millimeter and length of 10 meter. Consistency and flow behavior indices for applesauce are 
assumed to be 0.5 Pascal second to the power n and 0.7 and those of concentrated milk are 30 
Pascal second to the pow er n and 0.6 respectively. If the Reynolds numbers are 500 and 5000 for 
both the liquids, calculate the average velocities and pressure drops.

So, this we have to find out, right? Now if we do this , we have already writ ten it dow n that what 
has been given and what we have to find out, right? And for first , let us try for concentrated milk , 
the generalized coefficient of viscosity , gamma this is k to the power k prime 8 to the power n 
prime minus 1, right? So , this is from the defi nition, now , if we substitute k prime n prime with k 
and n, then we can write gamma is equal to k into 3 n plus 1 by 4 n to the power n and this is 8 to 
the power 1 minus n, right? Because , this n prime minus 1 this can also be written as k prime 
divided b y 8 to the power 1 minus n prime, right?  
So, that is what exactly we have written here, so , we have k prime and k relation and n prime and 
n relation , these two we have utilized which , we had given you earlier, right? So , it is in terms of 
k 3 n plus 1 by  4 k into 3 n plus 1 by 4 to the power n 8 to the power 1 minus n. Now , given k for 
milk, concentrated milk , it is k is equal to 30, right , into 3 n, n is given as 0.6, so , 3 into 0.6 plus 
1, right , divided by 4 n 4 into 0.6, right , this to the power n that is 0.6 divided by 8 to the power 1 
minus n 8 1 minus 0.6, right? So , now let us see how much it comes, so , it is 30 or 3 into 0.6 
equal to so much plus 1 is equal to so much divided by 4 divided by 0.6 is equal to so much to 
the power 0.6 is equal to so much into 30 is equal to so much divided by 8 to the power 1 minus 
0.6 so much is equal to so much 14.32, right?  
This is for gamma, right? Now , NRe general , this is given as 500 so , it is 14.32 Pascal second to the 
power n, right? So , if N Re general  is given for 500, then we can write the average velocity , vaverage , 
right? This is equal to N Re general , right , into gamma divided by D to the power n rho this to the 
power 1 by 2 minus n, right? So , for that N Re general  is 500 into this gamma has been found  out to 
be 14.32, right? D has been found out to be 10 millimeter , i.e., 10 into 10 to the power minus 3 
whole to the power n, n is given as 0.6 and rho given is 1030, right?  
So, this whole to the power 1 by 2 minus 0.6, right? So , let us also find out ho w much it is, right? 
So, 500 into 14.32, right , is equal to so much divided by 10 into 10 to the power minus 3 that is 1 
into 10 to the power minus 2 that is 10 to the power minus 2 minus 2 that is here plus minus 2 
whole to the power 0.6 divided by 1030, so, x to the power 1 by 2 minus 0.8 1 divided by 2 
minus 0.6 not 8 0.6 so 1.4 this much , so, should be this much 28.749 or 75 so , much meter per 
second, right?  
So, vaverage  for concentrated milk is 28.75, right? So , that is true, now let us also find out the delta 
P, for this we have to also find out not only this delta P, right? So , delta P we can write , 32 
gamma L by D v average by D to the power n, right , is equal to 32 into gamma we have found 
out 14.32 into L by  D, right? L is 10 meter so into 10 divided by D is 10 millimeter , so, 1 into 10 
to the power minus 2, right , into v average , we have just found out to be 28.75 over D is 1 10 to the 
power minus 2 whole to the power 0.6 n, right? So , this comes equal to , let us look into that 
28.75 divided by 10 to the power minus 2 whole to power 0.6 into this , is 10 by 10 to the power 
minus 2, so , into 10 to the power minus 3, right , into 10 to the power 3 into 14.32 into 32 is equal 
to 54484843, right?  
So, this is equals  to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right? So , equals to 554.84 kilo Pascal, no this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5 so , 554, so much Pascal, so , it is 554 and okay divided by bar so this we can write 55484 
bar, right? Because , 1 bar is 101325 kilo Pascal or Pascal , so, that is roughly this 554.84 bar or is 
equal 544 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 so 54484 kilo Pascal, right? So , if we convert it into bar then it is around 
554.84 bar, right?  (Refer Slide Time: 19:32)  
 
 
Now , this is for milk , we also have to do the same thing for the applesauce, so , for applesauce 
the same thing we have to do for 500 and 5000, so , for N Re general  is equal to 5000 , so, vaverage  is 
equal to N Re general  gamma by D to the power n rho to the power 1 by 2 minus n, s o, this is equal 
to 5000 into 14.32 divided by 10 or 1 into 10 to the power minus 2 to the power 0.6 into 1030 
this becomes equal to 5000 into 14.32 divided by 1 into 10 to the power minus 2 to the power 
minus 0.6, so , divided by 1 into 10 to the power min us 2 to the power 0.6 is equal to so much 
divided by 1030 is equal to 1101.73, right? So much meter per second, right? 1101.3, we have 
not done another thing , 11.01 this to the power 1 by 2 minus n that is we have to do 1 by 2 minus 
n that is 1 by 2 minus 0.6, right? So , if we do this to the power , x to the power y to the power 1 
divided by 2 minus 0.6, right? So , this is done this is done , so, this is equal to 148.9, so , this is 
148.9 meter per second, okay.  
So, delta P then that comes equal to, right , delta P that then comes equal to 32 gamma L by D 
vaverage  by D to the power n, so that is equal to 32 gamma , we found out to be into 14.32, right , 
into L, L was 10, right? And D was 1 into 10 to the power minus 2 or 11 0 millimeter into v average 
is 148.9 by D is 1 10 to the power minus 2 to the power n, right? n is 0.6, right? So , if we do this 
in the calculator , this becomes 148.9 divided by 10 to the power minus 2, right , whole to the 
power 0.6, right , into this is minus 2 and this is 1 minus pl us 3, so , into 10 x to the power 3 into 
14.32 is equal to into 32, right? 14160432 is equal to 14160430 , so much Pascal is equal to 
14160.43 kilo Pascal is equal , sorry , 146160430.  
So, this so much 1461 or 2 say , rounded of 1462 bar, right? So , this is wha t the delta P  is. Now , 
we need to also find out this is for milk, so , for applesauce we can write that gamma is equal to k 
into 3 n plus 1 by 4 n to the power n is equal to for applesauce we had , if you remember , we had 
rho is 1100 , D remain s same, n remai ns same, k is 0.5 n is 0.7, right? So , k is 0.5 into 3 into 0.7 
plus 1 by 4 into 0.7 to the power 0.7 this much equal s to we write 3 into 0.7 is equal to so much 
plus 1 yeah equal to this divided by 4 into 0.7, right , is equal to this whole to the power 0. 7 is 
equal to 1.07, so , earlier , it was 14. Now, it is 1.073 because , earlier value of k was 30 , now, the 
value of k is 0.5.  
So, if gamma is so much, so for given v general  NRe general  equal to 500 , so, vaverage  is equal to we can 
write that 500 into 1.073 divided by 1 into 10 to the power minus 2 whole to the power 0.6 so 
here it is 0.7 into 1100, right , 1100 whole to the power 1 by 2 minus 0.7, so , if we do it in 
calculator , it becomes 500 into 1.073, right? So , much divided by 1100 is equals to so much , I 
hope , we have done rightly divided by 10 to the power minus 2 to the power 0.7 equal to this 
whole to the power 1 by 2 minus 0.7 43. So , 43.46 meter per second is the average velocity 
which , was 28.75 for that , so, gamma value is less, there gamma value was more so , that is why 
viscosity was less there and viscosity velocity is less there and velocity is more there, right?  
This is for gamma and earlier gamma value was 28.75 so viscosity was viscosity was 28.75  
gamma was 14.32, right? So , for 500 , this we have done, now delta P is equal to 32 into gamma, gamma is found out to be 1.073, right , into L by D is 10 by 1 into 10 to the power minus 2 into 
vaverage  that is 43.46 divided by D that is 1 into 10 to the pow er minus 2 whole to the power 0.7, 
right? So , this is equal to let us do quickly the this time is very short, so , 43.46 divided by 10 to 
the power minus 2 , sorry , 43.46 divided by 10 x to the power 2 minus equal to this much to the 
power 0.7 is this much i nto this 10 and this so 1000, right , into 1.073 can we additionally did 10, 
so, into 32 is equal to 12089615.9 or 16 we can rounded of so much Pascal is 12089.616 kilo 
Pascal is equal to 120.89 bar. So , one we have done for 500 both velocity and delta P so , you 
please find out the velocity and delta P for 5000 N Re general , okay time is out thank you.
