Problem on Pneumatic conveying Part -2 
So, if you remember , we had been doing one problem , and this was on typically trial and error 
type of solution, right? So , when we had taken trial and error , we had done first two trials you 
saw that , it was not coming as the solution.  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:05)  
 
Now , let us look into the third one, okay , but, to recapitulate , because , otherwise , you have to go 
back to your previous lecture, that is difficult . So, from where we started that , let us write , we 
wrote that , the equation was RT by M ln of p 1 by p 2 plus 1 plus S plus 4 alpha f L by D, right , 
this into GRT square by 2 M square, right , into 1 by p 1 square minus 1 by p 2 square, right , plus 1 
plus S into g into z 1 minus z 2 is equal to 0, right?  
We found out in the previous class , value of RT by M is equal to 8.4 int o 10 to the power 4, 
right? We found out 1 plus S plus 4 alpha f L by D , this is equal to 137.8 , we also found out GRT 
by M square half of that, right? GRT by M square , half of that was equal to 3.48 10 to the power 
12, right , and these are the 3 , and the fourth one , 1 plus S into g into z 1 minus z 2, this was of  
minus 3188.25, right?  
So, we got tri al 1, assuming p 1 by p 2 is equal to 1 , that, therefore , p1 is equal to p 2 and we got this 
left hand side of this whole equation was equal to less than 0, right , was negative, right? That is 
less than 0, why? Because , p1 by p 2, p1 was equal to p 2, so, this went off , this is ln of 1 , i.e., 0, so, 
first two terms 0 , this was negative , so it is less than 0. In trial 2 , we had assumed that let p 1 by p 2 
is equal to 1.2 , i.e., p1 is equal to 1.2 p 2, right?  
So, if we write that , we had written it, so , instead of p 1, we had written , 1.2 p 2, so, here it was 1.2 
p2 square and here , 1 by p 2 square , so, if we take p 2 square out, so 1.2 square minus 1 that 
became negative, so , this term became negative , this was positive , this term negative , so, this 
value was very small, so , left hand side again became negative , so this is less than 0, right? Now, 
let us take the third trial.  
So trail 3 , let us take , if it is , 1.2 is less, tha n, let p 1 by p 2 is equal to say 1.5, yeah , say let us take 
p1 by p 2 is equal to 1 point,  something, maybe 4 or 5 , so that , this becomes 1.5 , this becomes 
positive. So , if we take this, this value , we have found out to be RT by M , 8.4 into 10 to the 
power 4 plus, this value , we have seen 137.8, right? Of course , here one, ln of p 1 by p 2, i.e., ln of 
1.5 into this 137 , this into , we had this whole stuff , to be 3.48 into 10 to the power 12, right? 3.48  
into 10 to the power 12 , and we took 1 by p 2 common and inside of it becomes 1.5, right? 1.5 p 2 
square minus 1 by p 2 already taken out, so , 1.5 square divided by 1 minus , we had this 3188.25, 
right?  
So, if we make this solution , and see what the value, so, we get , 1.5 square inverse, right? 1 
squar e 1 by 1 square, okay , so, this value is 0.44 minus 1 is equal to minus 0.55 , are we doing 
correct , so, 1 by p 2, 1 by p 2 comes out, right? So , p1 is, 1 by p 1 is 1.5 p 2, right? So , if we write , 
1.5 p 2 square , so, 1.5 p 1 by p2 goes out, so , 1 by 1.5 square m inus 1, right? So , that becomes , 1 
by 5 square so that is minus 0.55, right? And this is 1 , and let us see , what about ln of 1.5, 1.5 ln 
is positive 0.40, right? So , this is positive , this is negative , this is also negative, right? If that be 
true, so , 1.5 minus this is that, though , we had this GRT by this thing was 10 to the power 12, 
okay , so, it was 137.8 into 10 to the power 12 , so, 1 by 1.5 square minus 1 , so, this becomes , ln 
of 1.5 into 8.4 into 10 to the power 5, so , let us see , 8.4 10 to the p ower 4 , so, that becomes 
34059, right? So that becomes 34059 , right?  
And this we have seen to be negative, okay , that was negative , that is 1.5 square inverse minus 1 
is equal to that minus , into 137.8 into 3.48, is it 10 to the power 12 , or 10 to the pow er 9? It was 10 to the power 3.48 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 , yes 12. So , 3.48 into 10 to the power 12, 
okay , then how come it becomes positive , then, 26 our this thing was GRT square by 2 M square, 
right? GRT square by 2 M square , 1 plus S 4 alpha f L by D , so, that has become 137.8 , this is 10 
to the power 12 , and this is minus of that , 1.4 p 2, right? And without the value of p 2, p2 is 1 
atmosphere , so if we take 1 p 2, then 1.2, right? This is 1.5 , so, 1.5 square  minus 1 this is minus 
and that became equal to minus 26641, so , it is still a bigger number, right?  
This is still a bigger number , 10 to the power 12 , so, how come it is then , it has become p 1 by p 2, 
1.5, so, this is 34099 is okay, but how it has come so  less, our 1 by 2 GRT M square is this, so , 
3.489 10 to the power 12 , is okay , and this has become 3 minus 3.88 , fine, so, when I took ln of 
p1 by p 2 is 1.5, then this became , this number, fine , but how come this has become so low , 
26015 , because in our ex pression it was GRT by 2 M square, yes , 1 by p 1 square minus 1 by p 2 
square, not cube , 1 by p 2 square by 1 by p 2 square.  
So, if that is true, then ln of p 1 by p 2 is 1.5 , so, it has become that 34059 , or something , and this 
value is 137 , this value , 10 to the power 12 , this value has minus 0.55 something. So , if so much , 
and this is negative , then how come then this has become 1.5 , this 26016.236, right? So , this has 
become so low , 14308 , in that first case , 1.2, when we took , it came like that, so , it was 3.489  
into 10 to the power 12 , so it was 1 by p 1 square minus 1 by p 2 square, so p 1, p2, so, p1 1.12 p 1, 
we have taken p 2 is 1, so we have taken the ratio p 1 by p 2 is 1.2, right?  
So, p1 is 1.2 , this is 1 , and if it is taken 1.2, then , p1 is 1.2 p 2, right? So , if we substitute here, 1 by 
p1 and p 1 is 1 atmosphere, right? And if we take 1 atmosphere 101325, right , Pascal , so, that has 
to be taken , then only this number will come so low. So , 1 by p 2 square , that is into this 1 by 1.2 
square minus 1, ri ght? So , when we are taking p 2, p1 no, p2 is given as 1 atmosphere, right? That 
is 101325 Pascal, right? That is p 2, so, if we write the value of p 2 as 101325 square into 1 by 1.2 
square minus 1, so if we look at that, then 1 by 1.2 square , 1.2 square is t his, inverse of that 
minus 1 is equal to this, right? Okay , divided by 101325 square is equal to so much , into we had 
this value , where this one 3.48 into 10 to the power 12 and 137, so into 137.8 into 3.48 into 10 to 
the power 12 is 14272, right?  
So, that is how it came negative , for this case , if we write it was for first time , it was okay , this 
term was 0, this term was 0 and it was negative , this term is negative , for the second one , this has 
become 1.2 ln, right? So , this is some positive value , this has become negative , and negative is how much minus 14272 , and this was 3188 , and this was RT by M , it became 8.4 into 10 to the 
power 4 , this came 8.4 into 10 to the power 4 is equal to 84000, okay , this into ln of into 1.2 , 1.2 
of ln is 0. So , 15315,  15315 , so, plus 15315 minus 14372 minus 3188 was a negative value , it is 
true, right? So , we have to convert this 1 atmosphere to Pascal , and substitute this into p 2, then 
only, we can get i t. So, in that case , this value , we have got for p 2, right? 1.5 that is if p 1 by p 2 is 
1.5, then this value , we got for the first term, second term we got let us look into again , what is 
the value of second term, second term came out to be 1 by 1.5 square, right , inverse minus 1 is 
equal to this , divided by 101325 squa re, equal s to this into , it was 3.48 into 10 to the power 12.  
So, it came to be minus 188, so , our thing was 34059 minus 188.31 minus 3188.25 , if we neglect 
that, then it became to be calculated as 34059 minus 188.31 , if we do minus 3188.25 , this is 
equal to 30682, right? So , that means , this is a positive value, right? So , this is a positive value, 
right? That means , this is greater than 0, which means that the value is lying between 1.2 which 
was negative and 1.5 which is positive , this has become negativ e, this has become positive, 
right?  
So, it is lying between 1.2 and 1.5 that is , the ratio p 1 over p 2 is between 1.2 and 1.5 . It lies 
between that. So , now we have to take 1.4 , in a similar fashion , we have to find out , that is why I 
said these compressible fluid flow , the calculations are very big , and that is why typically I have 
taken that with the help of the calculator let us also try online , the reason being , you also 
practice, right? Otherwise, we could have done outside , and put the value , then it would have 
become very difficult for you to understand.  
For example, here we had said in the problem that outlet pressure was 1 atmosphere, right? And 
inlet pressure is to be found out, right? If we put 1 atmosphere , in an atmospheric term, then this 
problem will be very  difficult  to solve and the units , which we have , so, here atmosphere has to 
be converted into Pascal. So , 1 atmosphere is 101325 Pascal, so , the moment we took that 
101325 Pascal we could realize that fir st trial , when p 1 was equal to p 2 was there , that time , it 
was okay, but , when it became p 1 is equal to p 2 other than that, 1.2 times p 2, then it became 
negative , first time also it became negative, right?  
We found whatever we had done was not coming, so , then we realized that , no, it should be 
converted into Pascal, the moment , if you convert it into Pascal , we found the solution , it was 
like that and then we carried out for 1.5 , we saw this is to be positive.  (Refer Slide Time: 28:12)  
 
Now , if we take the value of p 1 by p 2 to be 1.4, then by properly doing , I am not , because , now 
we are running out of time. So , if we do 1.4, then the first term , left hand side , first term is 
coming 28283.668, second term is coming minus 22936.763, third term  3188.25 , and when it is 
coming like that if we add up , then, it becomes equal to greater than 0, right?  
So, it is positive, right? So , this becomes positive , so, it is less than , then, that means , p1 by p 2 
lies between 1.2 and 1.4, right? So , p1 by p 2 less than 1.2, but greater than rather , greater than 1.2 
but less than 1.4, right? So , if that be true, now let us take p 1 by p 2 to be equal to 1.3 , and left 
hand side , we will see this is still negative , right? And that means , it is less than 0, so , we can say 
1.3 is less than p 1 by p 2 less than 1.4. So, it is lying between 1.3 and 1.4, so, now let us take p 1 by 
p2 to be 1.33, right? And we will see that , it is, this is then , not positive, this is negative , so, it is 
less than 0 , that is this 1.3 rather 1.3 and 1.33, p1 and p 2 lies between 1.3 and 1.33. So, if we take , 
1.33 then we will see , left hand side , this is greater than 0, right? This is positive and greater than 
0. So , that means 1.3 less than p 1 by p 2, greater  than 1.33, rather , 1.33 should have been p 1 by p 2, 
right?  
So, it lies between 1 .3 and 1.33, so , this way if we , how many number of digits, so , it is 1.3. So 
how many number of digits , you want it to be accurate , so, you have to go on doing the trial , and 
then, find out whether it is 1.33 or  1.3, 1, 5 , things like that, right? So , this is a way , you have to 
do the trial error , and find out the value, right? Okay, thank you.
