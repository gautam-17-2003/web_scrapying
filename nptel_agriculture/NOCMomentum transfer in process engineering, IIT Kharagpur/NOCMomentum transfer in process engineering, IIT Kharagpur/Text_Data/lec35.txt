Variable fluid flow-problems and solutions (Continued) 
Okay, we have done variable flow, right? And we have done a problems also with that and let us
do  another  problem  because  solving  problem  will  give  you  confidence,  that,  yes,  you  are
proceeding in the right way. Whenever, you do anything, you try to make solutions of problems,
and numerical problems, and the moment you do it, that gives you two things, number 1, the idea
of the numerals, what is the pressure, what is the velocity, all these you can come to know, like
coefficient of discharge, unless you have some idea, while doing the problems.
So, suddenly you cannot tell that, what is the coefficient of discharge values, more or less what
different, of course it is company make, so, that depends on the nozzle, or that came with
instruments, and this is a company make, and company will tell you that, what is the value of
that Cd, but still, while you are doing the solution of the problems, you come across, and you can
definitely tell, that the values are around 0.98, 0.95 it can also be 0.85, depending on the design,
depending on the valve, depending on the comnay, depending on the nozzles, which you are
getting from the supplier, right? (Refer Slide Time: 2:11)
So, let us do another problem, and this problem tells that, A reservoir of oxygen is maintained at
900 millimeter of mercury pressure, and 25 degree centigrade temperature. A 10 millimeter
nozzle, fitted to this reservoir, releases oxygen to a pressure of 650 millimeter of mercury. If
molecular  weight  of  oxygen  is  32,  what  is  the  rate  of  release  of  oxygen?  Further, if  the
downstream pressure falls to 200 millimeter of mercury, what is the percentage increase in the
rate of supply of oxygen? You assume, Cd value to be 0.98, molecular weight, this I should
change because, small m is not molecular weight, so, it is capital M. So, molecular weight of
oxygen is 32 and the given heat capacity ratio is 1.4, right? 
I repeat, A reservoir of oxygen is maintained at 900 millimeter of mercury pressure and 25
degree centigrade temperature. A 10 millimeter nozzle, fitted to this reservoir releases oxygen to
a pressure of 650 millimeter of mercury. If molecular weight of oxygen is 32, what is the rate of
release of oxygen? If the downstream pressure falls to 200 millimeter of mercury, what is the
percentage increase in the rate of supply of oxygen? Assume Cd 0.98, molecular weight already
given 32 and gamma 1.4, right? Here also we should write, otherwise it is millimeter 200
millimeter of mercury that millimeter is coming capital so it should be small millimeter of
mercury, right? Yeah, fine.(Refer Slide Time: 5:37)
So, then, if we solve it, then, we know, w at 650 millimeter of mercury, whatever has been said,
this is equal to Cd A 0 under root 2 gamma p rho by gamma minus 1, right, into p 0 by p to the
power, or, rather, 2 by gamma minus p 0 by p to the power gamma plus 1 by gamma, right? So, if
that is true, then, we can write, given, let us write that, Cd is 0.98, then M is given 32, then D is
given, D of nozzle is given 10 millimeter, so, it is equal to 10 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter,
then, temperature given, 25 degree centigrade, is equal to 273 plus 25, i.e., 298 Kelvin, right?
And gamma given is 1.4, then p 1 is given at 900 millimeter of mercury and p 2 is given 650
millimeter of mercury, right? 
So, and also we have to find out that what is the value of A 0, A0 is pi by 4 D0 square is equal to pi
by 4 into 10 into 10 to the power minus 3 whole square, right? And this is equal to pi by 4 isequal to this into 10 to the power minus 3 that is 1 into 10 to the power minus 2, so, into 10 to the
power 2 plus minus is equal to, that is what, so, when you calculate, you have to be very careful
so, pi by 4 into 10 into 10 to the power minus 3, whatever is written, let us take that otherwise
chances of mistakes are there and it is occurring.
So, this square, right, so, that means, this 7.853 into 10 to the power minus 5, right? So, we can
write w650, this is equal to 0.98 into 7.853 into 10 to the power minus 5 under root 2 into 1.4
divided by 1.4 minus 1 into p, p given is your 900, right? p given is 900 millimeter of mercury,
okay, and millimeter of mercury, 900 millimeter of mercury, so it is 900 into 760, 900 into 760,
atmosphere, is equal to 760 millimeter of mercury, right? Or 1 millimeter of mercury is 1 by 760
atmosphere, right? So 900 millimeter of mercury is equal to 900 divided by 760 into 101325
Pascal, right? 
So, there should be written 900 into 101325 divided by 760, right, into 760, so, this is what this
times, we can write here, since, this is ratio, so, we can write this p o, 650, p is 900 to the power 2
by 1.4 minus, 650 divided by 900 to the power 1.4 plus 1 by 1.4, right? So, till now, it is okay,
so, this part is done, let us do this part. So, if we do 650 by 900 is equal to this, to the power 2 by
1.4 is this, so, that is becoming this minus, so, let us take first this, and second, this that 650
divided by 900, right? So, this is equal to this to the power 1.4 plus 1, i.e., 2.4 divided by 1.4,
right? So, this becomes that, then, that becomes this, then, this is equal to this, fine.
This times 101325 times 900 times 1.4 times 2, right, is equal to this divvied by 1.4 minus 1 i.e.,
0.4 divided by 760 is equal to so much, this is under root, so much into 0.98 into 7.853, 7.853
into 10 to the power minus 5, 0.0166 is equal to 0.01666, right? This much of w, that is kg per
second, right? And this is divided by 3600, is equal to, sorry, into 3600 square is equal to 59.96
kg per hour, right? So, if it is w 650, so, what about then, w 200. So, w200 is 0.98, right, into pi by 4
10 to the power minus 3 square, right, into this remains under score 2 into 1.4 into this is from
900 to 200, so, 900 into 101325 divided by 1.4 minus 1 into 760, right? 
So, these times this is 200 by 900 to the power 2 by 1.4 minus 200 by 900 to the power 1.4 plus 1
by 1.4, right? If this is true, then this we have already done, this is equal to 7.853 into 10 to the
power minus 5 times let us see how much is this, right? So, that comes to be equal to 200 by 900
is equal to this to the power 2 by 1.4, right? So, this is so, minus 1 then, 200 by 900 to the power
2 by 1.4, right? So this is 1, 2 minus, right, minus 1, 200 by 900, right, to the power 1.4, 2.4 by
1.4, so, this becomes, that becomes, this becomes this, right? So, hopefully, then, I again, some mistake has been done, some mistake again has been done. It
is better do it carefully? 2 by 1.4 so that is this minus 1, 200 divided by 900 this goes x to the
power y 2.4 divided by 1.4, is this, and this is closed and finally is this, right? That we got it
perhaps correctly into 2 into 1.4 into 900 into 101325 is equal to this divided by 0.4 divided by
760 is equal to this, so, this is under root this times 0.98 times 7.853 times 10 to the power minus
5, 10 to the power 5 plus minus, this is equal to this, right? So, it is 0.0142, right? kg per second,
0.0142, say 4, right? This divided by, not divided by, this into 3600, is equal to 51.25 kg per
hour, right? So, it was 59.96 kg per hour, here it is 51.25 kg per hour, hopefully they also got a
similar number 0.0192, in our case 0.0142, in our earlier case 0.0166, in their case it was 0.0186.
However, then this means that this pressure that w 200 was this 0.0192, 0.0186, 0.014, 0.0166, so,
how much percentage increase in the rate? So, it is coming to be decrease 59 to 51 so, it is
coming to be decreased, but actually it is increased, that was, it is being shown that this is
becoming an increase and this increase is w 650, that we have found out, in otherwise, we have not
done anything wrong, that 0.985, there is Cd pi by 4, this is the diameter 10 to the power minus 3
whole square, so, 2, that gamma 1.4, p 900, right? 101325 divided by 1.4 minus 1 into 760 what is
not done is rho that is PM by RT, that is not there should have been done.
So, rho is equal to PM by RT, where it is 900 into 32 by 8314 into 298, right? So, that should
have been there, right? So, if that value comes to, then it is 900 into 32 is equal to this divided by
R, 8314, divided by 298, is equal to 0.0116 kg per meter cube. So, that should have been there
which, here also, it is missing, that value of rho, right? Because, this is 2 gamma p rho, so, value
of rho should have been there, and that we can find out, from rho is equal to PM by RT, so much
0.0116 kg per meter cube.
However, if we put that then, it is here into 650 by 900 p 0 by p to the power 2 by gamma, i.e., 2
by 1.4 minus 650 by 900 to the power 1.4 plus 1 by 1.4. So, this is supposed to come a value
which obviously is not also this one, some other, please check and see how much actual it is
coming, and in a similar way w 200, in this case w200 will be your this is rho, 900 so, w 200 will be
again, PM by RT, so we can write 200 into 32 here also some more thing had to be written
101325 by 760, so this may not be the right number, some number in kg per meter cube will be
there, so, here also 200 into 32 by 8314 into 298 into 760 into 101325, so, this you put that
becomes equal to some value.So, that rho value also has to come here, right? 0.985 by 4 into D square into 2 1.4 into 900 into
101325, fine but, here, rho value has to be there, 1.4 minus 1 into 760, 200 by 900 to the power 2
by 1.4 minus 200 by 900 to the power 1.4 plus 1 by 1.4. So, this what will happen? This value
will have lower value, whereas, this value will have higher value and from there we can show
that the increase is this much, and we can find out the percentage, this is what exactly the
intention of the problem, given is that you work with value and calculate and get really the
insight of it, or get really the numbers which are associated, for example 5 percent, 3 percent
increase or decrease whatever if depending on the cases it will be, right? 
So, when it is like that, then we can find out the real difference, okay so, thank you for this class,
thank you.
