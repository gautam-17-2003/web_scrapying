Solving Problems on Ergun's Equation (Contd)  
In the previous class we have solved one problem on packed bed, using Ergun’s equation. 
What did we do? We assumed value of Delta p and from the Ergun’s equation we because 
from that Delta p we found out the exact pressure and from that average here densit y between 
the inlet and outlet, so , that average density we utilised and we got the assumed and actually 
calculated values by closed. And we said that if possible future we will also try to do similar 
problems or if we come across another problem then we c an practice and utilise the Ergun’s 
equation more meaningfully. So , let us do another problem, this is like this.  
(Refer Slide Time:  1:32)  
 
Air at 390 Kelvin flows through a packed bed of cylinders having a diameter of 0.0127 meter 
and length the same as diameter; this means the cylinder can be treated as a sphere. The bed 
void fraction is 0.45 and the length of the packed bed is 4 meters. The air enters the bed at 2.5 
atmospheres absolute at the rate of 3 kg per meter square second, so mass flux is set ba sed on 
the empty cross -section of the bed. Calculate the pressure drop of air in the bed given 
molecular weight is 29 and Mu 1.5 10 to the power minus  5 Pascal  seconds. So , I repeat, this 
is like that air at 390 Kelvin flows through a packed bed of cylinde rs having a diameter of 
0.0127 meters and length the same as diameter that this means that the cylinder can be treated 
as sphere.

The bed void fraction is 0.45 and the length of the packed bed is 4 meters. Air enters the bed 
at 2.5 atmosphere absolute at the rate of 3  kg per meter square second based on the empty 
cross -section of the bed. Calculate , the pressure drop of air in the bed given molecular weight 
of air is 29 and viscosity of air is1.5 10 to the  power minus  5 Pascal se conds. So , if you solve 
this, what is said that we have a packed bed of cylinders, now these cylinders do have this is 
the cylinder height, so , height is equal to the diameter , that is why this can be taken as D and 
this is D, so, these 2 D are same, so this cylinder can be assumed to be sphere. But if you 
assume a cylinder to be a sphere than all cylinders can be equal to sphere, so , then it appears 
that you may have to find out the sphericity, how close it is to a sphere, so , that we will find 
out. 
1st, you have to find out that air , as we have said that if this is a cylinder , if this height , and 
this diameter are same, then , theoretically diameter and height of cylinder , if they are same 
then, that appears to be equal to a sphere. But , whether it is a sphere or not or what is the 
sphericity of that sphere, sphericity means , how close it is to the sphere that , 1st you have to 
find out , and then you can use the other things. So , let us find out that the length of the 
cylinder , i.e., L is equal to diameter of the cylinder , say D cylinder. Therefore, volume of the 
cylinder V cylinder , that should be equal to Pi by 4 into D of cylinder square into D of 
cylinder , which is the height , that means Pi by 4 D c cube. So this should be equal to Pi by  6 
Dp cube that is the actual volume of the sphere having particular diameter D p. 
So, our given thing was , the cylinder has a diameter of D cylinder = 0.0127 meter, so , if that 
be true then D p cube = this Pi this Pi goes out , so, 6 by 4 D c cube or D p = cube root of 6 by 4 
Dc cube = cube root of 6 by 4 D c is 0.0127 , so much cube. So , let us look into , how, what the 
value is, so , 0.0127 cube x to the power y or x is cube, so , this is that into 6 divided by 4, so , 
it is cube root, cube root is equal to 0 .0145 , so, that means , particular diameter is 0.0145 
meter. Then , we can say that Phi s is 6 V p by D p Sp, this you have done in the packed bed class 
beginning, Phi s is 6 V p by D p Sp = 6 into Pi by 4 V p is Pi by 4 D c cube divided by D p. We 
have already found  out to be say this is the value , but, this we can also write to be cube root 
of 3 by 2 into D c cube.  
So, we can also write this to be cube root of 3 by 2 D c cube no D p is D c cube root , so, it is D c 
not cube root , cube root of this, here D p cube is 6 by 4 D c cube , so, Dp is cube root of , okay , 
Dc cube , is that 6 by 4 D c, so, cube root , if it goes out , so, it is 3 root 3 by 2 D c, we write this 
way, cube root 3 by 2 D c because this D c cube, cube root , it goes out okay. So , Dp is so much 
and S p, this into S p, Sp is how much? It is Pi D c square , 3 by 2 Pi D c square , Sp is 3 by 2 Pi D c 
square, so , this becomes equal to , this is D c cube , so, Dc square, so , this goes out, this Pi this 
pi goes out , and this is 6 by 4 , this is 6 by 4 , i.e., 3 by 2 , so, this 3 by 2 , this goes out , so, then, 
it remains 3 by 2 under root 3 , 3 by 2 under root 3.  
3 divided by 2 is equal to so much, cube root of that , so, this becomes cube root of 3 by 2 , 
okay , Dc into 3 by 2 Pi by S p is Pi D c square clear, so , it is Pi , this is square , so, this 3 by 2 
may not be going out , so, 6 by 4 , so, it becomes 3 by 2 , okay , because , Sp is how much , Pi D c 
square , so, well, from this 3 by 2 comes, so , then this D c cube goes out , then 3 by 2 , and this 
divided by under root 3 by 2 , it is cube root. So , it is 1.5 divided by that came to be 1.14, Pi 
into D c cube fine  and D p is from here cube root of 3 by 2 D c fine and this is Pi D c square , that 
is the S p, that is the surface area of this particle that is Pi D c square.  
Pi, Pi goes out, 6 b y 2 remains, 3 by 2 , by root 3 cube , root of 3 by 2, so , this is 3 by 2 , 1.5,  
so, 3 by 2 cube root is 1.144 , so 1 by 1.5 by 1.144, so , 1.144 divided by 1.5 , no, no, no, no, I 
think , I have made a mistake , that is 3 by 2 , 1.5, 1.5 cube root of this , inverse of this , yes, so, 
it was , no, 3 by 2 is there. Then , it becomes equal to this 3 by 2 goes out, 1 by cube root of 3 
by 2, so, that becomes equal to 0.873 , so Phi s is 0.873.  
  (Refer Slide Time:  18:04)   
 
Then Phi s is 0.873 , then we can write N Re = Phi s by Mu to D p into G prime by 1 – Epsilon, so 
this becomes equal to Phi s is 0.873, D p is, Dp we have found out to be the cube root of this , 
no, okay , so, that we put D p, Dp not given, D p we have to find out , that is 6 by 4 0.127 cube , 
so, that goes out Dc that is cube root of 3 by 2 , Dc, so, cube root of 3 by 2 D c. D c we have 
been given , that, so, it can be 0.0145 and G prime, G prime is i t given? G prime is given as 3 
kg per meter square, into 3 divided by Mu , given is 1.5 10 to the  power minus  5, and e psilon , 
given is 1 – 0.45, so , this becomes equal to 0.0127 is given , oh, it is just having a diameter of 
0.0127 , yes that D p is given 0.0127 , so, not required, it is 0.0127, so this is 3.  
So, we can write that 0.873 into 0.0127 into 3 divided by this divided by 1.5 , this divided by 
1 – 0.45, divided by 10 to the power minus  5, 4031. So that means that our energy is very , 
very high, so , in the outlet pressure depends on Delta p , so, we, assumin g as 1st 
approximation , density is equal to that at  inlet pressure. So , inlet pressure , given is 2.5 
atmosphere, so , Rho inlet = p M by R T , or p inlet by R T = 2.5 atmosphere into 1.01325 10 
to the power 5, M is 29, R is 8314 and T is given 390 , T given i s 390 , so, it comes to be 2.266 
kg per meter cube.  
  
(Refer Slide Time:  24:14)   
 
Now , from Ergun’s equation , we have seen that  Delta p Rho by G prime square phi s Dp by 
Delta L epsilon cube 1 – epsilon 150 by N Re + 1.75 , so, from this , we can write that , Delta p 
to be equal to G prime square by Rho into Delta L by Phi s Dp, 1 – epsilon by e psilon cube 
into 150 by N Re + 1.75. So , this, if we write , that means , this is 3 square by Rho, Rho , we 
found out 2.266, Delta L given is 4 meter , here, it is 4 meter, s o, 4 by Phi s, Phi s, we have 
found out as 0.873 , we have found out , or say 4, 3 something was there , so, rounded of to 
0.874. So , Delta p , so, 1 – this has been given as 0.45 div ided by 0.45 cube into e psilon 150 
by N Re, N Re is 4036 + 1.75, this is equal to 15.439 kilo Pascal, so , Delta p is 15.439 kilo 
Pascal.  
Therefore, since , p inlet = 2.5 into 1.01325 10 to the power 5 Pascal, there , and Delta p is 
15.439 Pascal, so therefore p exit or outlet = 2.5 into 1.01 325 10 to the power 5 – 15.439 
Pascal, this is also Pascal, so this means that Delta p comes to be equal to or p outlet comes to 
268.7515 kilopascal. So , with this outlet , as again one, so , then, and this is p inlet so , p 
average can be found out as p inlet + p outlet o ver 2 = this comes to be 261.032 kilo P ascal. 
Therefore, Rho average , that can be written as p average M by R T , and that can be said to be 
equal to 2.34 or 2.334 kg per meter cube. And if we do the same way Delta p calculation, 
then, Delta p comes to be 1 4.589 kilo  Pascal, which is to be very close to the assumed value , 
or, what we have found out p average from there , and 1st approximation.  
So, very close to the Delta p assumed, so , we can say Delta p to be equal to 15.069 kPa 
finally. So , this way by doing trial and error , you can find out that what is exactly Delta p or 
if one is given p 1, we can also find out the outlet , whatever  is given depending on the 
situation. So , here you have seen that we have taken both, the laminar part, length  part, that is 
the entered Ergu n’s equation and from there if one  is given like inlet pressure is given, outlet 
is not given , and in this case , we assume that both inlet, outlet they are different , true, what 
we assumed that density to be at the inlet pres sure and we found out Delta p. With that Delta 
p, we found out pressure outlet and from there again average , and from that average , again 
we found out what is the Delta p, so , this way by trial and error we can find out the actual 
value , okay , thank you.
