Nozzle flow-problems and solutions 
So, we had finished in the previous class that sonic, I mean not sonic, velocity we had done with
the nozzle flow, right? And, we also have seen that what is the velocity when your nozzle flow is
normal, and what is the maximum velocity and what is the discharge corresponding to the
maximum discharge or corresponding to the velocity maximum the discharge maximum that also
we have seen, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 1:14)
Now, that if you remember, we had given that v 0 was equal to, yeah, under root 2 gamma p
divided by gamma minus 1 into rho into 1 minus p 0 by p to the power gamma minus 1 by
gamma, right? This was our normal velocity, and velocity under maximum, which we call it to be
critical velocity, and, this was under 2 gamma p, right, by gamma minus 1 into rho into 1 minus
p0 by p to the power gamma minus 1 by gamma under critical, right? 
So, if we remember that, it was like this, critical was that, okay, p 0 by p, yes, w was, this was, 2
by gamma, no, this was not this, this was velocity, okay, and w was given like this, w, discharge,
was given as Cd A 0 under root 2 gamma p by gamma minus 1, right, and this with rho and thiswas p0 by p to the power 2 by gamma and this was p 0 by p to the power gamma plus 1 by
gamma, this was normal discharge, and discharge under critical condition, was Cd A 0, right, 2
gamma p rho by gamma minus 1, and this was p 0 by p to the power 2 by gamma under critical
condition, p0 by p to the power gamma plus 1 by gamma, right? So, this was our critical velocity,
under nozzle flow, and critical discharge, under nozzle flow, or flow through the nozzle, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 4:25) 
And we had done also solved the problem. So, now, if we see another problem, let it be here, if
we see another problem, which tells that, this problem, we had done. So this is another problem,
that it says, Air flows through a nozzle of diameter 1.3 millimeter having a discharge coefficient
of 0.95, from a pressure of 5 atmosphere to a pressure of 1 atmosphere at 25 degree centigrade,
what is the maximum velocity and mass flow rate? 
I repeat, Air flows through a nozzle of diameter 1.3 millimeter having a discharge coefficient of
0.95, from a pressure of 5 atmosphere to a pressure of 1 atmosphere at 25 degree centigrade.
What is the maximum velocity and mass flow rate? (Refer Slide Time: 5:34)
So, if we go back to that previous, which we have already written here, that in the nozzle flow,
the velocity is like this, and velocity under critical condition is like this, discharge was like this,
and discharge under critical condition was like this. Now what was that critical condition? 
(Refer Slide Time: 5:57)
If we just remember a little that we said, if the ratio of p 0 over p, if this is equal to 0.528, then we
call that, this is under critical pressure ratio, right? Or, the converse is also true, that, if the
pressure ratio of p by p 0 is equal to 1.893, then also, it is under critical pressure ratio that is called
p0 by p under critical, this is also p by p 0 under critical, right? So, if we apply that, right? (Refer Slide Time: 6:47)
And, here in this problem, we have been given that the pressure p is equal to 5 atmosphere and
pressure p0 is equals to 1 atmosphere. We are also given a diameter, we are also given a diameter
of D is equal to 1.3 millimeter, is equal to 1.3 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter, right? And, we
are also given that the coefficient of discharge, i.e., Cd is equal to 0.95, and temperature, T is 25
degree centigrade, is equal to 25 plus 273, is equal to 298 Kelvin, right? 
So, these are all given, obviously, from the relation, which, we had given that velocity, v 0, is
equal to under root, 2 gamma p by gamma minus 1 rho, into 1 minus p 0 by p to the power gamma
minus 1 by gamma under critical condition, this to know, that, we know p we know p 0, we know
gamma, gamma we cannot give, so, we can assume it to be say, 1.4, like the previous one.
So, gamma is equal to1.4. If we assume, right? And, rho, we have, it has not been given, so, rho,
we can write equal to PM by RT is equal to p is 5 atmosphere, 5 into 101325 into, air, so, we can
say, molecular weight of air is 29, so, it would be 29 divided by R, 8314 into 298 T. So, this
comes to equal to, let us look into that calculator, 5 into 101325 into 29 is equal to this divided
by 8314 divided by 298 is equal to 5.93, is equal to 5.93 kg per meter cube, right? 
So, if it is 5.93 kg per meter cube, then, v 0 from this, we can write to be equal to under root 2 into
gamma, 1.4 into p, 5 into 101325 divided by gamma, 1.4 minus 1, rho, into 5.93, into under root
1 minus p0 by p critical, so we can write 0.528 to the power 1.4 minus 1 divided by 1.4, right?
So, if we start from here, so, we can calculate it like this. This is 1 minus, one bracket 0.528 tothe power, xy, to the power 1.4 minus 1, that is 0.4 divided by 1.4, right? This is equal to, that is
equal to this is equal to 0.166, right? 
So, this into 101325 into 5 into 1.4 into 2, this is equal to that, divided by 1.4 minus 1, i.e., 0.4
into 5.93. So, this is, that is equal to 99749, right? So, hope we have done, somewhere something
wrong. So, let us redo that is 0.528 to the power 1.4 minus 1 that is 0.4 divided by 1.4 is this to
the power is that, right? So this is plus minus this so plus 1 is equal to 0.166 fine, into 101325
into 5 into 1.4 into 2 is equal to this, right? Divided by 0.4 into 5.93 is equal to so is equal to this,
okay this is under root so if we take square root yes it is 315.83 so equal to 315.83 meter per
second this is the velocity under critical or maximum velocity. So maximum velocity is 315.83
meter per second that is the velocity under critical pressure ratio, right? So this we have done,
Now we like to see what is the discharge know. 
(Refer Slide Time: 16:15)
And for that discharge under critical pressure ratio we have seen Wcr is Cd A0 under root 2
gamma p rho by gamma minus 1 into p0 by p to the power 2 by gamma under critical pressure
ratio minus po by p to the power gamma plus 1 by gamma under critical pressure ratio, right? So
if we know see that what is the A0, right? What is the value of A0, A0 because Cd is given, so
what is the value of A0 if we look at then we can see that A0 is pi by 4 into D square that is pi by
4 into D was D was given, yeah D was given 1.3 10 to the power minus 3 meter, right? So 1.3 10 to the power minus 3 square, so this becomes equals to cancel pi by 4 into 1.3 into 10
to the power minus 3, right? So this becomes that this square of this now square of this is this,
right? So this becomes equals to 1.327 into 10 to the power minus 6 meter square, right? So if
that is true, then Cd is given Wcr critical condition Cd is given Cd was given 0.95, right? So Cd
was given 0.95 A 1.327 into 10 to the power minus 6 and this is under root 2 gamma is 1.4 p is 5
into 101325 rho we got previously yeah rho we got 5.93, right? 
So we got 5.93 by 1 minus gamma or 1.4 minus 1 into this times p0 by p critical, so 0.528 to the
power 2 by gamma 1.4 minus 0.528 to the power gamma plus 1 1.4 plus 1 divided by 1.4, right?
So this is that, so if we look at what is the value so then let us start from the other end that is
0.528 x to the power 2 by gamma that is 1.4, right? So this is equal to that minus how much
0.528 so 0.528 to the power 1.4 plus 1 that is 2.4 divided by 1.4 is this, so is this so is equal to
this, right? So this multiplied by 2 multiplied by 1.4 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 101325
multiplied by 5.93, right? 
So this is equal to that divided by 1.4 minus 1 that is 0.4, right? So much, so the whole is under
root so this becomes 2905, right? This become 2905 so that means again we have done a
mistake, so let us redo and first we check whether we have written everything we have not done
mistake my goodness, so after square root we had to add this, so this we have not given
unnecessarily we are redoing, so 0.528 to the power 2 by gamma is this equal to this minus 0.528
to the power (1.) 2.4 divided by 1.4, right? 
So this becomes that, right? And then the second one then is equals to 0.06 earlier also hopefully
it was like that into 2 into 1.4 into 5 into 101325 into 5.93 is equals to so much divided by 1.4
minus 1 that is 0.4 is equal to so much under root of this is this much into which we missed last
time 0.95 is equal to this into 1.327 into 10 to the power minus 6 so this is equal to 0.00149,
right? So 0.00149 so it is then 0.001496 that means 1, 2, 3 so if 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 so it is it is 1, 2, 3
1.4 is equals to 1.4 into 10 to the power minus 3 kg per second, right? 
So this can be made into kg per hour by multiplying 3600 is equal to 5.386, okay kg per hour,
right? Now the difference is that hopefully here it is differing but 0.528 to the power 2 by 1.4 we
have taken, right? 0.528 to the power 1.4 plus 1 by 1.4 we have done, right? 5.93 is the density
we have taken correctly 101325 we had taken for that, but perhaps 5 is missing here, right? Sofrom this value whatever we have gotten there that is (2.) no, 6.69 10 to the power minus 4 so we
know our value this is 5.386 so if we do 6.69 into 10 to the power minus 4 is equal right into 5
under root is this so it comes like that.
So we missed 0.01496 so we missed here somehow this term p that is 5 into 101325 that should
be there, right? So correct it and then it is okay, right? So correct in the slide that 5 this figure
was not there in the p so that should have been so we have made it to 2 Pascal that is true but
somehow missed there so correct one is this 5.386 kg per hour or 0.001496 or 1.4 10 to the
power minus 3 kg per second, right? So we have found out the critical velocity and critical mass
flow rate, right? Thank you.
