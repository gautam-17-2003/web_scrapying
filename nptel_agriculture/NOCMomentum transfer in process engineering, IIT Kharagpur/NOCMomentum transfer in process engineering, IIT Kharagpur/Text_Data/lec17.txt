Laminar and turbulent flow in a pipe 
Okay, we had then seen what the frictional factor is, how it is defined, and how we can find out
from Moody’s chart, right? Now, let us look subsequent things, that after the Moody’s friction
factor, once that is done, we can see that okay. Next we  handle it with a problem for given one,
this is of course nothing but a mathematical problem.
(Refer Slide Time: 0:51) 
For a turbulent flow, in a pipe it has been established that v is equal to v max into 1 minus r by R to
the power 1 by 7. So, then you have to calculate the average velocity. (Refer Slide Time: 1:28) 
So, the problem is for turbulent flow in a pipe, it has been seen that v is equal to v max, right, times
1 minus ratio of small r to capital R to the power 1 by 7. So, if this is there, then, what is the
value of vaverage, right? Now, we have shown earlier for pipe flow also, we have shown that when
you are doing it for average flow that average flow is defined by this way that v average is equal to 1
by pi R square, 0 to R, right? Area is 2 pi r dr, right? 
And this can be written as 2 pi divided by pi R square, right, into v r dr, right? This is between 0
to R, right? Now, this can be written as, 2 v max over R square, right? And 0 to R and 1 minus r
over R, 1 minus r over R to the power 1 by 7, r dr, right? So, this, we can also write is equal to 2
vmax, right, over R square between 0 to R, right? Now, let us define this as, x is equal to 1 minus r
over R, right? Therefore, we can write, small r is equal to capital R into 1 minus x, right? 
Or, we can also say, dr is equal to minus r dx, right? So, if that is true, we can say for r is equal to
0, x becomes equal to 0, and for r is equal to R, x becomes equal to 1. So, this, which we had
earlier done, okay, now, this we can replace for R is equal to 0 to r is equals to R. So, r is equal to
R, it is 1 and r is equal to 0, it is 0, right? So, this is x to the power 1 by 7, R 1 minus x into
minus R dx becomes, there is minus R dx, right? So, between 0 to R, r is equal to 0, x is equal to
0, r is equal to 0, x becomes equal to 0. Now, for r is equal to 0 you see r is equal to R so this
goes out x becomes equal to 1, right? And for r is equal to R, x also becomes equal to 1, okay.
For r is equal to 0, x becomes equal to 0, for r is equal to R, x becomes equal to 1. So, it is 0 to 1
x to the power to 1 by 7 R 1 minus x into minus R dx, okay. So, if this is true, then we can write
this is equal to minus 2 v max, right, over R square, right? And here also R square this R and this Rmakes R square, right? And this we can write between 1 to 0, x to the power 1 by 7 1 minus x dx,
right? 1 to 7 this minus, we have taken out, right? This minus we have taken out minus 2 v max this
R this R has made R square already there was one R, okay and this was 0 to 1, right?
x to the power 1 by 7, right? 1 minus x dx dx, right, and only one thing, which is x is equal to 1
minus r by R, so when r is equal to 0 so x becomes equal to 1, when r is equal to R, x becomes
equal to 0. This is what the problem was. r is equal to 0, x is equal to 1 and when r is equal to R,
x becomes equal to 0. 
So, it should have been 0 to R, so, from there it is x is 0 to 1. So, this was our original, right? 1 to
0, so, that means this we can write to be equal to minus 2 v max R square by R square 1 to 0 x to
the power 1 by 7 1 minus x dx, right? On simplification, we can write, 2 v max, right? R square
goes out and now with a negative then we can write it to be 1 to 0 x to the power 1 by 7 dx,
right? Minus 1 to 0, x to the power 8 by 7 dx this is 1 by 7, right? Minus 1, so it is 8 by x to the
power 1 by 7 into 1 that is 7 plus 1 8 by 7. So, x to the power 8 by 7 dx, okay, 1 to 0, now, this
we can re-write to be minus 2 v max, right? and between x to the power 1 by 7 means x to the
power 8 by 7 divided by 8 by 7 this is between 1 to 0 minus this one x to the power 8 by 7, right,
8 by 7 plus 1, so, 15 x to the power 15 by 7 over 15 by 7, right? So, this is also between 1 to 0,
right?(Refer Slide Time: 11:11)
So, if this is true, then we can write that this is equal to minus 2 v max, right, times now, this we
can write x to the power 8 by 7 and 0 and 1, when we put this limit then, we write 1 by 8 by 7
plus 1 by 15 by 2, right?
(Refer Slide Time: 11:48) 
Because, this when we had seen, this was between the two minus 2 v max we maintained minus 2
vmax, right? And this was x to the power 8 by 7 by 8 by 7 when x is 1, right? Then automatically,
1 minus comes in when x is 1, automatically, because this is 0 minus 1 so when x is 0 this is 0
then, 1 minus this that 1 by 8 to the power 8 by 7 and this is minus 1 by 15 by 7.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:35)So, that is what we got, and this 1 minus, and that minus, made us, this as plus, right? 
So, this on simplification, we can write v max, right? vmax times minus 1 by 8 by 7 which we have
written, so, it is 7 by 8 minus plus 2 by 15, right? So, this is nothing but 2 v max. So, our
denominator 2 vmax, of course here we had a negative, which we forgot, minus 2, negative we
have now, 15 8 120 and this becomes 15 this becomes 8 two’s are 15 8 two’s 16 and 56, right?
This is 8 two’s are 16 minus 15 7’s are 105, 15 7's are 105, right? It is okay. If we take 7 or 7 by
15 to where and 7 by 8, no this 15 by 15 by 7, how come it is 2,(Refer Slide Time: 14:40)
How, come it is 2, this is x to the power 1 by 15 by 7 and 8 by 7, okay. So, this is 1 by 8 by 7 this
is 15 by 7, or that is what the mistake was, so it is 15 by 7. So, 2 v max 16 not 16, we can re-write
minus 2 vmax, right, into this 7, if we take common then it becomes 1 by 8 minus plus 1 by 15,
right? Or, is equal to 7 two’s are 14 v max, right? 7 two's are 14 v max and this becomes 1 by 15
minus 1 by 8, right? So, this is 14 v max, right? 14 vmax, 120, so, this becomes 8 and this becomes
this, becomes minus with this negative was there, this negative is still there so if the negative is
still then why do we carry out.
So, this we can take that negative inside 14 v max, right? 1 by 8 1 by 15, right? That is 1 by 15 over
1 by 8, right? 1 by 15 1 by 8 minus 1 by 15, this is 14 v max, right? And 120 now, so, this is 15
minus 8, right? So, this is 14 v max, 15 minus 8 is 7 by 120, right? And if we divide, this becomes
2 or 7 and this becomes 60, right? So, it becomes 49 by 60 v max, right? This is nothing but 0.817
vmax, right? So, we could find out, what is the average velocity, so, average velocity is 0.817 v max.
This is a typical, your problem. This kind of relations, you can also generate and then find out
what is the average value, with the actual value with the maximum value, right?
But, you must also know that, the relation which you have put here, you, if you remember, we
started with vmax having a v is equal to v max, so much that relation, which we get and so, you must
have one such relation, where it will have a meaningful relation and some value like here, we
have found out, this is to be equal to 0.817, right?
(Refer Slide Time: 18:37) Whereas, we started with that relation was v is equal to v max into 1 minus r over R to the power 1
by 7, right? So, any such relation, if we have, then, you can get the average velocity in terms of
maximum velocity.(Refer Slide Time: 19:11) 
So, we got the average velocity. This is equal to maximum velocity of so much 0.817 times of
maximum velocity. Keep in mind that this relation is a just for 1 exercise to find out the average
velocity, right? Because, average velocity, if you go back to your previous, and previous that 1
by area times the area total, so, were that integrated between the limit 0 to 1 or 0 to 2 pi, then r to
capital R, like that depending on your regime, which you are handling with, and then find out
and then get into it, right? So, this way we can determine a relation, okay. (Refer Slide Time: 20:12) 
Then, let us also solve another problem quickly, so that we are accustomed with this that, A
starch solution at 30 degree centigrade is flowing through a horizontal tube, 0.3 meter long and
0.00254 meter inside diameter. For a pressure drop of 2.75 into 10 to the power 5 Pascal, the
flow rate is 1.127 into 10 to the power minus 4 meter cube per minute. The density of starch
solution at 30 degree centigrade is 1260 kg per meter cube. From the flow data, find the viscosity
of starch solution, right? 
I repeat, A starch solution at 30 degree centigrade is flowing through a horizontal tube 0.3 meter
long and 0.00254 meter inside diameter. For a pressure drop of 2.75 into 10 to the power 5
Pascal, the flow rate is 1.127 into 10 to the power minus 4 meter cube per minute. The density of
starch solution at 30 degree centigrade is 1260 kg per meter cube. From the flow data and the
viscosity of starch solution, find the viscosity of starch solution in Pascal second, right? One
thing given us hint that measurement of flow in circular tubes is one the common methods of
determining viscosity and such devices are referred to as “capillary viscometers” (Refer Slide Time: 22:31) 
So, this is nothing but a problem of capillary viscometer, right? So, if we solve. if we find the
viscosity we will tell that this is the viscosity as measured by the capillary viscometer. So,
capillary viscometer, if it is with your institutes, you can find out and check, knowing the other
values, and check whether your predicted value and the actual value are matching, or how far
they are close that you can determine, right? 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:17)
So, let us look into the solution. From the Hagen–Poiseuille’s law, we know that mu is equal to
pi into delta P to R square divided by 8 Q L, right? 
Mu is equals to pi delta P R to the power 4 not R square R to the power 4 by 8 Q L, right? So,
delta P is rather given, pi into delta P is given, 2.75 into 10 to the power 5 Pascal, right? And R is
also given as 0.00127 m, right, to the power 4 and this divided by 8 Q is also given as 1.127 into
10 to the power minus 4 meter cube per minute, right, times 1 minute by 60 seconds into 0.3
meter, that is L, right? So, this becomes equal to 0.5 Pascal second, right? 
So, viscosity we found out. So, we can say, Hagen–Poiseuille, so, Hagen–Poiseuille law we
found out the viscosity. What it is what the value is, right? Now, we find out Reynolds number
NRe is equal to D vz average into rho by mu that is equal to: 4 Q rho by pi D mu, right? So, if we
substitute these values, then this, we can write this is equal to 4 times 1.127 into 10 to the power
minus 4, so much meter cube per minute 1 minute, per 60 seconds, 1260 kg per meter cube
divided by pi 0.00254 meter times 0.5 second or 0.5 Pascal second given, right? 
So, this becomes equal to 2.37, which is nothing but, the flow is laminar, right? So, this becomes,
the flow is laminar. Now, there is a term that is also called entrance length, so and this entrance
length Le is related with N Re as 0.36D, 0.036 D NRe, right? So, this problem we can we have
handled, and okay we found out this to be 2.37, right?(Refer Slide Time: 27:58) 
Now, I give you another problem, which, I do not tell you, that this is assignment, but okay some
other day if you are not able to answer we will solve it and you first try that is the best thing, you
first try, if you are not able to find out the solution, I will definitely tell this, Do not take it as
assignment, but okay giving a problem which you can try with, right? 
So, for example, A liquid of constant density is flowing in laminar flow at steady state in the
horizontal x direction between two flat and parallel plates. The distance between the two plates
in the vertical z direction is 2z. Using a shell momentum balance, derive the equation for the
profile within this fluid. So, I repeat, right? And hope you can do this that is my expectation that
you can do this till now whatever we have done from that basis you can do this. If, again, you are
not able to do, obviously, I will give you the solution, but first you try, okay, at least till now
whatever has been covered, by that it can be easily done.
So, A fluid of constant density is flowing in laminar flow at steady state in the horizontal x
direction between two flat and parallel plates, the distance between the two plates in the vertical
z direction is 2 Zzero. Using shell momentum balance, derive the equation for the profile within
this fluid, right? So, I hope you can do this because, we have already done similar thing and that
similar thing, the pipe flow we have done, so, you can do it subsequently, right? So, in this
problem, with this given problem, let us complete this class today, and next time if you are not
able to solve, we will come across and solve it, okay, thank you.
