Solving problems on Ergun’s equation  
Yeah, so , we have done Blake Kozeny, Burke Plummer equation, right? And there we have seen 
that whenever  we are using this and whenever we are coming to the final form of the equation , 
known as Ergun’s equation , this Ergun’s equation is very , very useful when , you are applying it 
for packed bed, right? So , you know and I also said , and I am telling you repeatedly that if you 
can solve problems then you can think that yes , you have understood the problem , or you have 
understood the theory whatever has been taught, ri ght? So , now let us go and find out a solution 
of such problem , say one typical problem , as it is given here, right?  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:27)  
 
For example, if we say , Air at 303 Kelvin is flowing through a packed bed of spheres having a 
diameter of 12 mi llimeter. The void fraction of the bed is 0.4 and the bed has a diameter of 0.6 
meter and a height of 2.5 meter. The air enters the bed at 1.2 atmosphere s at the rate of 0.4 kg per 
second. Calculate the pressure drop of air in the packed bed. Given , molecu lar weight of air to be 
28.97 , kg per kg mole , and viscosity , to be 2 into 10 to the power minus 5 Pascal second. So , let 
us solve it but before solving let us read once more.  
Air at 303 Kelvin is flowing through a packed bed of spheres having a diameter of 12 millimeter. 
The void fraction of the bed is 0.4 and the bed has a diameter of 0.6 meter and a height of 2.5 
meter. The air enters the bed at 1.2 atmosphere s at the rate of 0.4 kg per second. Calculate the 
pressure drop of air in the packed bed. Given  molecular weight of air is 28.97 kg per kg mole 
and viscosity of air to be 2 into 10 to the power minus 5 Pascal second, right?  
(Refer Slide Time: 3:54)  
 
Now , let us solve this problem . So, if we solve this problem , what is given , we have a packed 
bed, right? So , bed is like this and there some spherical materials like this are there, right? And 
air is passing through this, right? So , we have been given that temperature T is equal to 303 
Kelvin, right? Packed bed of spheres , so, Dp is equal to 12 millime ter is equal to 12 into 10 to the 
power minus 3 meter, then we had been given that the void fraction epsilon is 0.4 , bed has a 
diameter of 0.6 , so, this diameter of the bed D is equal to 0.6 meter, height of the bed , i.e., this 
height , H is say given here as 2.5 meter, right?  
And bed , it enters , our bed at 1.2 atmosphere s, so, pressure at the bed inlet is equal to 1.2 
atmosphere s, right? And the flow rate is given in this way that it is the G prime , i.e., mass 
velocity is 0.4 kg per second, right? Or , we c an say , not mass velocity , we can say , this to be the 
mass flow rate , m dot to be 0.4 kg per second. Other things , which are given , are molecular 
weight of air , M air to be 28.97 kg per kg mole, right? And viscosity , mu is equal to 2 into 10 to 
the power minus 5 Pascal second, right?  
Now , if we remember that Ergun’s equation , which we said that was delta P is equal to not delta 
P, it was delta P rho by G prime square phi s Dp over delta L epsilon cube over 1 minus eps ilon, 
this was equal to 150 over N Re plus 1.75, right? So , first, let us then find out , the sectional  area 
through which it is flowing . So, cross sectional area of the bed , this we can write to be pi by 4 D 
square is equal to pi by 4 into 0.6 squares,  so many meters  square, right? Therefore , we can write 
that G prime , i.e., mass velocity was 0.4 was kg per second, right?  
So, kg per second divided by the area into 1 by area or CS , cross sectional area , if we write, so , 
this is in terms of meter square, right? So , that becomes equal to 0.4 divided by pi by 4 0.6 
square, right? So , so much kg per meter square per second, right? So , we can say that this is 
based on the empty cross sectional area, right? So , how much it com es then 0.4 by 584 by 0.6 
square , so, let us look into this, so , it was 0.4 divided by pi by 4 is equal to this, right , divided by 
0.6 square is equal to 1.414 kg per meter square second, right? So , G prime square we got to be 
so much, right?  
(Refer Slide  Time: 12:37)  
 
Then , we have to find out what is the delta P, right? So , we have to find out delta P , so, now let 
us assume delta P to be say , as small as possible say 0.05  into 10 to the power 5 Pascal, right? 
We have already been given p 1 equal s to, we have been given , 1.2 atmosphere s, so, this is equal 
to 1.2 into 1.01325 into 10 to the power 5 , is equal to, how much? 1.2 into 1.01325 is equal to 
1.2159 into 10 to the power 5 Pascal , 1.2159 into 10 to the power 5 Pascal, right?  
So, this we have seen, s o, we can say that if P 1 so much then P 2 is equal to 1.2159 10 to the 
power 5 Pascal plus delta P , this P 2 will be minus so P 1 minus P 2 is equal to delta P , so, P1 or P 2 
is equal to P 1 minus delta P , so, minus 0.05 10 to the power 5 Pascal is equal to , this becomes 
equal to 1.159 minus 0.05 is equal to 1.1659, 1.1659 10 to the power 5 Pascal, so , that is our P 2, 
right? So , we got P 1 and P 2, so, then, P average is equal to this 1.1619 plus 1.2159 is equal to , by 
2 is equal to 1.1909 10 to the power 5 Pas cal, right?  
So, we got P average , so, if we get P average, then we can also say the rho average is equal to P 
average, right? P average into M by RT is equal to 1.1909 10 to the power 5 Pascal , M is 
molecular weight , i.e., 28 point , it was given 28.97, ri ght? R is 8314 into , T is 303, right? So , 
then, rho average , then comes to be equal to 1.1 , this into 10 to the power 5 is equal to this much 
into 28.97 is equal to this divided by 8314 is equal to this divided by 303 is equal to 1.3695, 
right , is 1.3695 kg per meter cube, right? So , now we have G average , G prime , we have density  
average, right? And now , we can say that 1.3695, okay , so, we can say now N Re, this is equal to 
DG, right? D into G, i.e., okay , D particle G prime by mu into 1 minus epsilon, ri ght?  
So, D particle was 12 millimeter , 12 into 10 to the power minus 3 meter, right , into this G prime 
is 1.3695, right? And mu given was 2 into 10 to the power minus 5 into epsilon given was , 1 
minus 0.4, right? This becomes equal to 12 into 10 to the po wer 3 plus minus equals to so much 
into 1.3695 , now, G prime was 1.414 , sorry , 1.3695 is rho average, right? 1.3695 is rho average, 
right? So , we can say that it was 1.414, right , is equal to this divided by 2 , is equal to this divided 
by 10 to the power m inus 5 , 10 to the power 5 plus minus this, right , divided by 1 minus 0.4 is 
0.6, equals to 1414, right? So , NRe has become equal to 1414, right?  
So, now we use that Ergun’s equation , which we had shown earlier that was , delta P rho by G 
prime square , delta P rho by G prime square into phi s Dp by delta L, right? So , we have taken a 
sphere, right? So , phi s is 1, so, delta P by phi s, delta p by delta L, okay this is this , another 
epsilon cube by 1 minus epsilon, right? So , these three term s into this is equal to 150 by N Re plus 
1.75. So , out of this , if we say that , delta P is now not known, then we write delta P into rho , 
already we have found out 1.3695, right , divided by G prime , we have found out 1.414 , this 
square, right , times delta , phi s is 1, so, Dp is given as 0.012, right , Dp delta L , i.e., height in this 
case given as 2.5 meter, right? Epsilon given here is 0.4 cube divided by 1 minus 0.4, right? This 
is equal to 150 by N Re, we have found out 1414 plus 1.75, right?  Now, let us find out delta P times that 1.13 , this value 1.3695 divided by 1.414 square is equal to 
this, that is 0.6849, okay 0.6849 , so, this times 0.012 by 2.5 is equal to 0.0048, right , into 0.4 
cube is this divided by 1 minus 0.4 is 0.6 , so, this becomes 0.106, right? So , this is  equal to 150 
by 1414, 150 divided by 1414 is equal to 0.106 plus 1.75, right? Or , delta P , then becomes equal 
to, this is equal to 1.75 plus 0.106 is equal to 1.856, right? So , then delta P becomes equal to 
1.856 divided by 0.6849 into 0.0048 into 0.106, right?  
So, 1.856 divided by 0.6849 into 0.0048 into 0.106 , so, this becomes equal to 5326, right , is 
equal to 5326 Pascal . Now, that can be written as equal to 0.05 into , is equal to 5 into 326 into 10 
to the power 3 Pascal, right? So , when we made it this , 0.05, so, into 10 to the power minus 5 
Pascal, right? So , this means that we have shown that delta P , which we assumed to be 0.05 , here 
also by calculation , we have made that to be equal to 0.05, right? So , here also we have shown 
that this delta P has b egun 5326 Pascal meaning 0.05  into 10 to the power minus 5, 10 to the 
power 5 , sorry , not minus , sorry , sorry, 10 to the power 5 Pascal , 0.05 10 to the power 5 Pascal, 
right?                                  
So, which was our original assumption, so , that means what we ha s been assumed is correct, 
right? So , this way this is one way how we can use Ergun’s equation, right? Do some 
calculations , some problem solving , then it become s more and more clear  with this, okay. We 
will try to solve if we get some more  time,  in future maybe in the following class, okay thank 
you.
