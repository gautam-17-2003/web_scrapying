Problem of Fluidized bed Condition Part 1  
So, we have done that minimum fluidisation velocity and what is the expression to find out 
the Delta p or pressure drop from the minimum fluidised condition if using Ergun’s equation, 
this we have done.  
(Refer Slide Time:  1:03)  
 
Now , it is some problem for t hat number 1 say a problem is like this, A solid particle having 
a size of 0.127 millimetre, a shape factor of Phi s of 0.9 and density of 1100 kg per meter cube 
are to be fluidised using air at 2 atmosphere absolute and 30 degree centigrade. The void  
fraction at minimum fluidisation condition is 0.4. The cross -section of the empty bed is 0.3 
meter square and the bed contains 300  kg of solid. Calculate , number (1) the minimum height 
of the fluidised bed, number (2) the pressure drop at minimum fluidising conditions, number 
(3) the maximum velocity for fluidisation . Given, viscosity of the fluid is 1.8 10 to the  power  
– 5 Pascal seconds and molecular weight of the medium is 29 , i.e., the fluid having molecular 
weight  of 29 kg per kg mole.  
So, if we if we reread , if read once again , it looks like this , the pro blem, A  solid particle 
having a size of 0.127 millimetre, shape factor of Phi s of 0.9, density of 1100  kg per meter 
cube are to be fluidised using air at 2 atmosp here absolute and 30 degree centigrade. The void  
fraction  at minimum fluidisation condition is 0.4. The cross -section of the empty bed is 0.3 
meter square and the bed contains 300  kg of solid. Calculate , number (1) the minimum height 
of the fluidised bed, number (2) the pressure drop at minimum fluidising conditions, number 
(3) the maximum velocity for fluidisation . Given, viscosity of the fluid is 1.8 10 to the  power  
– 5 Pascal seconds, molecular weight 29 kg per kg mole.  
(Refer Slide Time:  3:56)   
 
So, if we solve it, it looks like this that given from the condition given are particle having size 
or D p = 0.127 millimetre, shape factor  Phi s = 0.9, density Rho = Rho particles = 1100  kg per 
meter cube, pressure P 1 or inlet = 2 atmosphere absolute = 2 into 1.01325 10 to the power 5 
Pascal, then temperature T = 30 degree centigrade , then epsilon = epsilon mf = 0.4, cross -
sectional area = 0.3 meter square and bed contains 300  kg of solid , i.e., w or m , whatever we 
call, m = 300 kg solid. Apart from that , we are  also given Mu of the air , i.e., fluid = 1.8 10 to 
the power – 5 Pascal seconds and molecular weight of air = 29  kg per kg mole, this is what 
we have been given.  
Now, for solving it , let us take this way that if epsilon would have been 0 , i.e., there is no 
void, earlier also we had done the same thing , that we can use a mass, density, area of the bed 
to obtain the height of the bed in complete packed bed condition. So , if e psilon would have 
been 0 , then we can write , L0 A0 into 1 – epsilon 0, this is equal to L mf A0 into 1 – epsilon mf, 
because , we said uniform cross -section , earlier also that , there is no change in the cross -
sectional area , because , as long as this is fixed, our sectional area also remains same. So , if 
that be true, we can say tha t Lmf = L 0 A0 by A 0 into 1 – epsilon mf, if epsilon 0 is 0, we had 
taken , epsilon 0 as 0. So , if that be true , then we can write this is nothing but L 0 by 1 – 
epsilon mf. 
Now , volume of the solid this is equal to , we have been given that mass is  300 kg of solid by 
the density Rho of the solid , which is given 1100 kg per meter cube. So , this means , 300 by 
1100 meter cube. And , yes, let us look into how much it comes 300, 1100, let us take that 
calculator , 0.2727 meter cube. So , if volume of this is so much , then L 0 that will be equal to 
volume of the solid divided by cross -sectional area, so , this is equal to , volume has become 
0.2727 divided by 1100 , sorry , divided by cross -sectional area, cross -sectional area has been 
given 0.3 , so, this we can that 0.2727 , if we take this way 0.2727 divided by 0.3 = 0.909.  
So, 0.909 meter is L 0 therefore, L mf, this now becomes equal to L 0 by 1 – epsilon mf and 1 – 
epsilon mf L0 is 0.909, 1 – epsilon mf is given , 0.4 = 0.909 divided by 1 – 0.4, i.e., 0.6 so , 1.515 
so, minimum f luidised bed height, height of the bed under minimum fluidised bed condition , 
minimum fluidisation condition is 1.515 meter , whereas, the bed has packed only solid is 
0.909. So , as we have been asked, this is the first one , which we can say, we have been asked 
that what is the minimum height of the fluidised bed, minimum height of the fluidised bed 
that has become, then it is the pressure drop at minimum fluidising condition, so , let us go 
and see what is the pressure drop.  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:11)  
 
So, pressure drop , so, 1.515 was L mf was 1.515, so , roughly you can take 1.52 meter. So , now 
pressure drop under fluidised condition , this Delta P mf can be written as L mf into 1 – epsilon mf 
into Rho p – Rho into g.  Now, we have b een given , if you remember , in the previous sheet , we 
had seen , Rho p was given but Rho of air is not given . So, since temperature is given , we can 
say, Rho of air , that is equal to P M by R T, so , P is 2 into 101325 into M given , 29 divided 
by 8314 into 30 degree centigrade means 273 + 30 , that means , 303, so , 303 this becomes 
equal to , let us look into this , 2 into 101325 into 29 is equal to this divided by 8314 divided 
by 303 = 2.3328 , so, we can say roughly 2.33  kg per meter cu be. 
So, once we know Rho, then we can write that Delta p = L mf, was 1.52 into 1 – epsilon mf, was 
0.4, and Rho p was 1100 , i.e., 2.33 into 9.81 or 82 , in many cases we use. Therefore, this 
becomes equal to , let us see how much, 1.52 into 1 – 0.4 is equal to this into 1100 – 2.33 into 
9.82= 9830.55 Pascal So, this means , this is equal to 9.83 kilo Pascal , 9.83 kilo  Pascal is 
Delta p therefore, P inlet is so much, what is the P outlet? P outlet is Delta P, Delta P = P inlet 
– P outlet , so, P outlet is P inlet – Delta P, so , P outlet is P inlet – Delta P, P inlet is 2 into 
101325 , okay , and this we can write 101.325 , if we say , kilo Pascal – 9.83 = 2 into 101.325 = 
this – 9.83 = 192.82 kilo  Pascal, so , we have found out what is the pressure drop and what is 
the minimum fluidisation height.  
(Refer Slide Time:  20:35)   
 
Third one is what we need to find out the velocity, so , for that velocity , we can use that 
Ergun’s equation modified or new form of Ergun’s equation as we have done earlier. We can 
write from here that now since we know P 2, Delta P was 9.82 kilopascal and P 2 is 200 12 
point , so much Pascal, Delta P is 9.82 kilo  Pascal , so P 1 was, P inlet was 2 into 101.325 , 
okay , – 9.83, so, it is P in – Pout, okay , so, Pout is P in – Delta P. P in is this – that 192.82 , so, how 
come it is, yeah , 2 into , how come it is , Delta P in – Pout that is P out is P in – Delta P , yes, it is 
okay.  
Now , for that what we need? Average P, P average = P in + P out divided by 2 = P in was 2 into 
101.325 + 192.82 over 2 , so much kilo Pascal , so, let us see how much it is, 192.82 + 2 into 
101.325 , so, this is to , this divided by 2, 197.735 , so, much kilo Pascal = 197735 Pascal i.e., P 
average. So , we use that modified Ergun’s equation , then we can write that 1.75 by Phi s cube 
into 1 – epsilon mf square by e psilon mf cube N Re square , we said , it is a quadratic equation + 
150 divided by Phi s cube into 1 – epsilon mf square over epsilon mf cube N Re – Dp cube Rho by 
Mu square into Rho p – Rho into g , this is equal to 0. So , we can  say A N Re square + B N Re + 
or – C = 0, then , come s what is A and what is B.  
(Refer Slide Time:  25:52)   
 
So, A becomes equal to 1.75, Phi s given was , if I see properly , Phi s 0.9, Phi s given was 0.9 , 
then 1 – epsilon was 0.4 square divided by 0.4 square and this is what and this is equal to let 
us see how much it is, 1.75 divided by 0.9 cube into 1 – 0.4 square divided by 0.4 cube , not 
square, Phi s cube epsilon mf cube , so, that is 0.4 cube = 13.503 N Re square. B is 150 divided by 
Phi s 0.9 cube into 1 – epsilonmf is 0.4 square divided by 0.4 cube , so much energy and this is 
equal to 150 divided by 0.9 cube is equal to so much into 1 – 0.4 square = so much divided 
by 0.4 cube = 1157.4 N Re. 
And C = D p, particle size was given , 0.127 millimetre , particle size given was 0.127 
millimetre. So 0.127 millimetre into 10 to the power – 3 whole cube Rho, Rho in this case , it 
was, we found to be equal to Rho average , last we got average Rho is P average, so , when we 
got P average , we can also write Rho average = P avera ge into M by R T = P average is 
197735 into 29 by 8314 into 303 , so, Rho average came out to be 197735 into 29 divided by 
8314 divided by 303, 2.27 kg per meter cube.  
So, from there we got that , yes, C is this , so, that was into Rho 2.27 divided by Mu, Mu given 
was, Mu given , 1.8 10 to the power – 5, Mu square into Rho P – Rho, 1100 - 2.27 into 9.81 = 
0, so , what we get? We get a quadratic and from there , we get the value of v and v will come 
somewhere , v average from that N Re if we define N Re to be like this v mf prime is N Re into 
Mu 1 – epsilon mf by D p into Rho into Phi s, so, from there by calculation we get 5.5 10 to the 
power – 3 meter per second , from where this value.  
So, if you try , because we are not having any more time, time constrain t is there, so , if you 
try, hopefully , you will get , somewhere this value 5.5 10 to the – 3 meter per second , velocity 
using , because , from here this becomes , NRe square A + B N Re – C = 0. So , our quadratic 
equation , by solving it , we get N Re value , and fr om that N Re value we can get the value of v 
using this relation okay thank you.
