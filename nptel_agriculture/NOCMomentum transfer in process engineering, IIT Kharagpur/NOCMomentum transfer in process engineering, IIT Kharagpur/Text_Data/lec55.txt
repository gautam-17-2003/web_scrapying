Problem of Fluidized bed Condition Part 2  
So, we have done one problem on fluidised bed and perhaps at the end because of the time 
constraint we asked you that you please try and hopefully , you have tried, there was a 
quadrat ic equation in terms of say A N Re square + B N Re – C, that is equal to 0 , by using that 
Shridhar Achaya ’s formula , you can find out the root of a quadratic equation and you can 
find out N Re from there and that – B with the coefficients , – B ± (under root B square – 4 A 
C) by 2 A, using this formula , we can find out what is the val ue of that N Re, so that you have 
hopefully done, so , let us now do another problem say , let us do another problem yeah.  
So, this is like this, Air at 390 Kelvin flows through a packed bed of cylinders having a 
diameter of 0.0127 meters and length , the same as diameter , no this we have already done . 
So, hopefully , this one .  
(Refer Slide Time:  2:09)  
 
This is , Particles having a size of 0.2 millimetre, a shape factor of 0.85 and density of 1150 
kg per meter cube are to be fluidised using air at 25 degree centigrade and 202.65 kilo  Pascal 
absolute pressure. The void fraction , at minimum fluidising  is the minimum fluidisation, the 
minimum fluidisation velocity. Given, viscosity of the fluid is 1.3 10 to the  power  – 5 Pascal 
seconds and molecular weigh t is 29.  
(Refer Slide Time:  3:40)   
 
So, I repeat the problem, particle having a size of 0.2 mil limetre, a shape factor of 0.85 , so, 
let us write D p the solution when we do, let us write this way that D p is 0.2 millimetre = 0.2 
10 to the  power  – 3 meter, shape factor , i.e., Phi s 0.85, density , Rho particle is 1150 kg  per 
meter cube are to be fluidised using air at temperature, so , T is 25 degree centigrade = 298 
Kelvin , and pressure inlet is 202.65 kilo  Pascal. The void fraction at minimum flui dising 
condition , so, epsilon mf = 0.45, the bed diameter so D = 0.5 meter , and it contains 400  kg of 
solids, so m = 400  kg solid. And given Mu air = 1.3 10 to the  power  – 5 Pascal seconds and 
molecular weight of air = 29.  
So, as we have done earlier , here also that assuming 0 porosity , we can write that the bed 
volume that can be written = 400 kg by 1150 , that is equal to 400 divided by 1150 = 0.3478 
meter cube. So , if L 0 is the length corresponding to no porosity , then L0 becomes equal  to this 
volume 0.3478 divided by the cross -sectional area , pi by 4 D square pi  by 4 into , it was 0.5 
meters, so , 0.5 square, so , this become s equal to 0.3478 divided by Pi  into 4 divided by 0.5 
square, 1.77 meter. So , if it is so , then L mf we can write eq ual to L 0 by 1 – epsilon mf, so, this 
is equal to 1.77 by 1 – 0.45. So , we can write 1.77 divided by 1 – 0.45, so, that is 0.55 = 
3.218, so , we roughly can write 3.22 meter.  
So, if L 0 is known, L mf is known , then first one is done that  one is the L mf, 3.22. Second one 
is Delta P th at we can write as Delta P is L mf into 1 – epsilon mf into Rho p – Rho into g. Now , 
the question of Rho , so, we can write Rho = P M by R T and P is given as yeah , inlet so , 
202.65  kPa or 650 P ascal, remove that decimal , into M is 29 by 8314 into 298. So , this comes 
to be equal to 202650 into 29 into 29 divided by , is equal to divided by 8314 into 298 = 2.37 
kg per meter cube, so , this hopefully , you can see kg per meter cube okay.  
(Refer Slide Time:  14:50)   
 
Now , if Rho is so m uch, L mf we have found out 3.22 , 1 – 0.45, Rho p is 1150, Rho is 2.37 
and g is 9.82, so , this comes out to be 3.22 into 1 – 0.45 into 11 50 – 2.37 into 9.82 = 
19958.68 P ascal, so , we can say , 199.58 kilo  Pascal Delta p. So , Pout = 202.65 – 199.58 = 
3.07 k ilo Pascal. So , it appears to be a huge pressure drop 20062.2 yeah, it appears to be a 
huge pressure drop. So , Pout is there , so, you have got , then average of P in and P out, Paverage  = 
202.65 + 3.07, did we do any mistake here?  
199.58 kilo  Pascal , so, this P ascal 199.58 Delta P L mf, 3.22  1 – 0.451 into 1150 2.37 9.82 so , 
it is somewhere , 1150 , this is 0.6, we recheck this , let us , it is appearing a little absurd, 3.22 
into 1 – 0.45 into 1150 – 2.37 into 9.82 = 19958 , they have got Delta P , 2.37, okay , 202650 
okay , then, we got 3.07  kPa, P1 okay , Paverage  is 202 this by 2 = 3.07 into 101.325 this + oh ! 
3.07 kilo  Pascal , sorry , 3.07 kilo  Pascal , so, 30700 , 3.07 kilo P ascal means , or we can simply 
write , 3.07 + 202.65 is equal to this , divided by 2 = 102. 86. I do not know , this is appearing 
to be a little less kilo  Pascal, so , Rho average = P M by R T = 102.860 into M 29 divided by 
8314 into T 298, so , that becomes into 100 = 102860 into 29 = this , divided by 8314 divided 
by 298, 0.12 , okay , 0.12 kg per me ter cube, this is appearing to be low , very low.  
Okay, now , we know that D p cube , Dp cube Rho by Mu square Rho p – Rho, Rho p – Rho into 
g into Phi s epsilon mf square or cube Phi s epsilon mf cube divided by1 – epsilon mf square. And 
this value if we take , this should come to be 221.85 this value should come 221.85 , then, we 
can say that 1.75 N Re square + 150 N Re – 221.85 = 0.  
(Refer Slide Time:  21:43)   
 
So, from this equation , we can find out the Rho as N Re = – B that is – 150 ±  B square , 150 
square , –, –, + 4 A 1.75 4 into 1.75 into C 221.85 by 4 A C by 2 A, 2 into 1.75, this becomes 
equal to okay , 150 square + 4 into 1.75 into 221.85 is equal to so much , square root of this is 
so much. So , if we make it – then it becomes this , and this into , whereas, if we take it  equal 
to this divided by 2 into 1.75 is , this is equal to 1.45, so , NRe is 1.45.  
Now , from there , if we see that v  mf prime is equal to that , N Re Mu 1 – epsilon mf over Dp 
Rho Phi s. So, NRe is 1.45 into Mu is 1.3 10 to the power – 5, it was, 1 – 1.45 epsilon mf, Dp is 
0.2 10 to the  power  – 3 into Rho, Rho we got , somewhere , some wrong , but, it should be 2.27 
around or 2.25 into Phi s given , 0.85. So , if we do this , and see how much it is coming, it is 
1.45 into 1.3 into 10 to the power– 5, so much into 1 – 0.45 is equal to this divided by 0.2 
divided by 10 to the power – 3 divided by 2.25 divided by 0.85 = 0.027 meter per second. So , 
we have found out that velocity, so , velocity is coming to be 0.027 meter per second. Here , 
we have show n that the quadratic equation , which we got earlier here , it was 1.75 N Re square 
+ 150 N Re – 221.85 = 0.  
So, this on simply , in finding out the root , NRe we got , so, A X square + B X – C is got , say + 
C + is here –, so, that if we apply – B, – B ± B square – 4 A C , so, that became + by 2 A, 
which came to be 1.45. Now , from there v mf prime was N Re was Mu 1 – epsilon mf by Dp 
Rho Phi s, so from there we got this number and ultimately v  mf = 0.027 meter per second. So , 
this way , we can find out , and do  the problems and you must to some practices , so, that this 
kind of minimum fluidisation velocity or what is the height of the bed under minimum 
fluidised condition or what is the pressure drop , i.e., in majority cases that is required, so , 
what is the pressure drop that you can find out from the different relations under fluidised bed 
condition.  
Mind it that fluidisation is very helpful to increase the surface area for any extend of heat or 
mass or whatever that depends  on what you are choo sing as,  what you are choosing as the 
unit operation okay, thank you.
