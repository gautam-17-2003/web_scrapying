Nutritional
Value
of
the
Nutrient
So
we
have
come
to
know
what
is
food,
but
this
is
the
basic
you
every
time
we
will
show
you
that
courses
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
right.
So
from
there
we
have
come
to
know
the
basics
of
food
the
basics
of
nutrients
right.
Now
we
go
that
we
have
taken
this
fat,
protein,
carbohydrates,
vitamins,
minerals
and
water
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:56)
What
is
such
that
in
your
house
you
may
be
say
a
fat;
your
sister
brother
could
be
a
protein,
another
mummy
daddy
could
be
carbohydrate
or
some
other
thing
the
they
are
considered
like
that
the
basic
requirements,
basic
necessity
right,
but
unless
you
have
a
house
they
have
no
meaning.
Similarly
it
is
that
these
nutrients
that
fat
protein
carbohydrate,
vitamin,
minerals,
unless
water
is
also
there
it
has
no
completion
of
the
cycle.
So
water
has
to
be
given
due
respect
due
position
and
due
appreciation
for
it
is
purpose
of
taking
it
right.
So
when
we
have
taken
this
fat
protein
carbohydrate
then
it
can
be
said
that
it
helps
you
to
maintain
your
body ,
it
helps
you
to
for
your
growth
it
is
sustenance
everything,
you
see
when
you
were
child
you
were
maybe
1
feet
in
height,
now
you
are
5
feet
6
feet
in
1
height.
So
you
have
grown
up
from
that
small
to
this
big
how
and
every
stage
this
was
helped
by
the
food
only;
there
is
no
other
thing
by
which
it
was
right.
Now
you
had
played
you
had
done
many
many
things
you
were
doing
this
and
that
we
I
am
talking,
you
are
talking,
you
are
watching,
where
from
the
energy
is
coming?
These
energies
are
all
supplied
by
the
food,
then
it
comes
the
question
who
is
contributing
how
much?
Right,
fat
is
contributing
now
of
course
all
engineering,
all
sciences
are
according
to
the
units
are
according
to
the
SI
unit
right.
So
that
SI
unit
is
in
energy
terms
in
joules
and
others,
but
if
we
tell
in
that
then
it
may
be
some
decimal
numbers
say
5.2
or
8.9
like
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
remember
for
that
even
today
at
least
we
do
use
though
at
MKS
system,
till
for
this
energy
to
be
explained
or
said
fat
gives
1g
of
fat
it
gives
9
kcal,
1
g
of
fat
gives
9
kcal,
carbohydrate
gives
4
kcal
and
protein
gives
also
4
kcal
right.
So
carbohydrate
and
protein
they
are
4
kcal/g,
if
you
consume
per
gram
fat
you
will
get
9
kcal.
So
it
is
more
than
double
what
you
gain
energy
from
fat
than
that
of
the
carbohydrate
or
protein
right.
So
that
is
why
the
food
which
is
rich
in
carbohydrate
or
more
parts
in
carbohydrate
availability ,
that
will
give
you
one
kind
of
energy,
or
the
one
which
has
high
fat
that
will
give
you
another
kind
of
energy
or
someone
which
is
having
high
protein
that
will
give
you
another
right
of
course
in
energy
terms
we
have
just
said
that
protein
and
carbohydrate
do
have
the
same
number
4,
but
fat
has
9
per
gram
and
the
unit
is
kilo
calorie,
keep
it
mind
normally
you
do
the
mistake
that
1
gram
and
kilo
calorie
right.
So
of
course
you
can
converted
into
SI
in
joules
or
kilo
joules
as
when
you
need,
but
this
9
is
easy
to
remember ,
4
is
easy
to
remember
right.
So
if
you
convert
them
in
SI
unit
then
it
will
be
some
decimal
number
which
is
not
easy
to
remember
right.
So
that
is
why
still
we
call
9
fat
4
carbohydrate
4
protein.
So
let
us
look
into
different
food
items
which
gives
what
energy
right,
milk
gives
per
100
gram
of
milk
gives
65
kilo
calories,
bread
gives
230
kilo
calories,
butter
gives
740
kilo
calories
and
egg
gives
150
kilo
calories.
Now
from
these
numbers
is
it
not
imaginable
or
is
it
not
calculable
that
milk
does
not
possess
much
fat
because
it
is
giving
only
65,
right
So
fat,
protein
and
carbohydrate
if
it
sum
up
together
then
the
energy
total
17
kilo
calorie
per
gram
right.
So
from100
gram
we
are
getting
65
only.
So
it
is
almost
3
or
4
kcal/g
we
are
2getting
from
the
milk
that
should
contain
like
that
fat,
protein
and
carbohydrate
in
that
range
similarly
bread
is
giving
around
and
230
kcal
per
100
grams
right.
So
it
should
have
sufficient
quantity
of
fat,
but
it
is
not
so
it
is
lot
of
carbohydrate
as
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
in
the
previous
class
we
had
shown
you
that:
what
are
the
components
which
are
available
in
bread
as
well
as
in
milk
know .
So
there
you
have
seen
that
bread
contains
around
50
%
carbohydrates
right,
and
some
quantity
of
little
fat
little
protein
are
also
there.
So
that
is
why
around
to
30.
Butter
is
basically
fat
around
to
83
%
is
fat,
and
some
around
17
%
is
15
to
17
percent
is
moisture
or
water
and
where
out
2
to
3
%
salt.
Generally
you
will
see
that
fat
butter
when
you
taste
it
is
salty
you
do
not
have
to
add
externally
normally
some
salt
for
the
butter ,
but
yes
if
it
is
cream
there
is
no
salt
right.
So
butter
contains
salt,
water ,
as
well
as
fat
around
83
%
fat
so
that
is
why
it
is
giving
such
a
huge
energy
around
740
kcal/100g
right,
whereas
egg
is
taht
it
has
if
you
see
the
composition
of
egg
in
terms
of
fat,
protein
and
carbohydrate
you
will
see
they
are
not
very
high
right,
fat
is
also
moderate
protein
is
also
moderate
carbohydrate
is
low.
So
in
that
case
it
is
somewhere
in
between
around
150
right.
So
this
tells
that
depending
on
your
source
of
the
food,
depending
on
your
intake
of
the
food,
depending
on
your
type
of
the
food,
you
are
generating
energy
to
the
different
levels
right,
in
the
previous
class
if
you
remember
I
said
balance
diet
all
the
time
right
again
this
balance
diet
is
not
part
of
the
course
you
will
not
see
anywhere,
but
as
I
said
during
the
very
beginning
that
it
is
not
also
possible
to
encompass
a
class
within
this
kind
of
frame
work,
because
there
are
many
associated
things
come
in
where
if
it
is
the
then
not
told
then
it
becomes
vacant
and
that
part
should
be
known,
that
is
why
time
and
again
when
this
kind
of
situation
will
arise
will
try
as
much
as
information
you
can
disseminate
to
you.
So
that
balance
diet
will
help
you
in
what
way
that
this
energy
balance
according
to
the
requirement,
because
it
is
not
only
the
energy
which
your
body
needs
body
needs
to
build
your
body
as
I
gave
the
example
that
from
the
from
the
child
or
from
the
infant
stage,
when
you
were
1
feet
height
now
you
have
become
5-6
feet
height,
and
such
a
huge
growth
from
maybe
5-6
kg
to
now
60-70
kg.
So
that
huge
growth
where
from
it
came
from
the
food
and
lot
of
it
went
into
yes
your
daily
activities
as
well
growth
of
your
body
that
weight
that
building
up
of
the
body .
So
protein
and
also
your
body
structure
like
the
bones
and
others
so
3they
need
this
and
all
the
food
supply
these
need
right,
and
different
food
as
we
have
just
seen
that
they
supply
different
kinds
of
energy,
different
kinds
different
terms
of
fat
content,
protein
content,
carbohydrate
content.
So,
we
must
take
some
as
the
body
is
required
and
there
are
other
courses
where
these
are
more
or
less
in
detailed
studied
or
in
detailed
told,
which
this
is
not
possible
for
it
because
there
is
there
is
you
will
see
that
that
there
some
common
terms
are
also
there
right
common
terms
are
also
there
by
which
your
dieticians
they
do
they
do
finalize
they
do
tell
you
that
how
much
what
you
will
consume
right.
So
they
will
that
is
another
all
altogether
all
together
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

Now
objective
what
should
be
your
objective
after
studying
that
you
must
make
available
nutritious
food
as
cheap
as
possible
must
improve
nutritive
value
and
to
minimize
the
loss
during
processing
again
I
give
here
1
example
that
you
have
come
across
every
day;
your
mummy;
your
seniors
when
they
are
say
processing
milk
that
is
the
most
easy
or
rice
or
say
wheat
right
when
they
are
preparing
during
the
process
of
preparing
right
from
the
raw
material
to
the
finish
product
whether
it
is
rice,
whether
it
is
chapathi,
or
whether
it
is
milk,
if
you
have
if
the
she
has
taken
100
grams
or
1
liter
of
milk,
or
100
kg
100
grams
of
rice,
or
100
grams
of
wheat,
the
finished
product
he
got
never
equivalent
to
100
right,
some
were
lost
in
the
milk
you
will
see
some
at
the
bottom
of
the
container
is
associated
which
you
cannot
take
out.
4
So
that
is
the
lost
but
this
we
cannot
avoid
this
we
cannot
avoid
what
you
can
do?
You
can
minimize
that
is
why
when
milk
was
being
supplied
to
you;
mummy
had
done
taken
some
spoon
and
scratch
all
these
containers
so
that
as
much
as
comes
out
right.
So
you
being
the
engineer
or
scientist
you
will
be
this
will
be
your
responsibility
that
how
minimum
loss
during
processing
you
can
attempt
right.
Then
to
ensure
the
storage
ability
at
even
normal
temperature
I
gave
earlier
also
some
example
that
milk
you
are
keeping
at
in
the
refrigerator
right.
Now
that
is
avoidable
with
this
such
a
product,
but
again
I
tell
you
milk
if
it
is
pasteurized,
then
only
it
is
kept
in
the
refrigerator ,
but
if
it
is
sterilized
then
it
is
not
kept
in
the
refrigerator
you
go
to
the
market
ask
for
sterilized
milk
you
will
be
given
in
some
packaging
material
and
you
will
see
that
that
was
not
kept
in
the
refrigerator ,
that
was
in
open
atmosphere,
though
milk
is
so
much
susceptible
right.
So
this
is
1
example.
So
it
is
coming
to
you
that
you
must
make
that
additional
cost
to
be
minimum
that
you
have
to
keep
it
at
low
temperature
or
some
refrigeration
or
some
other
so
that
at
room
temperature
if
you
can
keep
as
much
that
is
your
objective
or
your
goal
it
should
be,
then
to
prevent
food
poisoning
or
contamination.
In
every
other
day
you
will
see
through
news
through
news
papers
that
from
these
area
or
from
that
area
by
taking
this
food
etcetera
etcetera
some
or
other
kind
of
mishaps
had
been
happening,
or
still
happening
right.
Why
it
because
either
the
food
was
contaminated
or
the
food
was
poisoned
or
spoiled
and
after
that
it
got
poisoned
and
because
of
that
this
mishaps
did
come
up.
So
your
objective
should
be
that
you
should
minimize
this
poisoning
or
contamination
as
far
as
practicable
right,
then
to
cater
special
dietary
requirement
somebody
may
need
high
carbohydrate
and
low
protein
somebody
may
need
high
protein
and
low
carbohydrate
minimum
fat
right.
So
depending
on
the
requirement
your
supply
also
has
to
be
accordingly ,
so
you
have
to
cater ,
you
have
to
make
food
in
that
aspect,
in
that
way
such
that
you
can
cater
as
the
requirement
is
coming.
Then,
to
develop
new
varieties
of
instant
and
convenient
foods
nowadays
people
are
so
much
busy
all
over
all
over
people
are
so
much
busy
that
they
do
not
get
sufficient
time
to
process
or
to
cook
or
to
make
their
food
everyday;
prepare
their
food
every
day.
So
if
you
can
manage
to
supply
that
either
precooked
or
semi
cooked
or
almost
cooked
half
cooked
things
like
that
so
that
the
consumer
will
have
minimum
time
requirement
for
processing
them,
then
your
invention
your
intervention
into
the
system
everything
will
be
5fruitful.
So
you
one
of
your
goal
also
should
make
should
be
that
you
can
make
convenient
food
such
that
conveniently
people
can
consume
as
and
when
if
they
are
requiring
it
right,
this
could
be
your
goal
then
we
come.
(Refer

Time:

For
understanding
some
of
the
terminologies
which
are
normally
used
we
call
that
this
food
has
become
perished
or
it
has
it
is
perishable
right,
what
does
it
mean
it
means
that
these
deteriorates
quickly
after
harvest
for
example,
fruits
and
vegetables
or
soon
after
slaughter
or
catch
for
example,
fresh
meat,
poultry
or
fish
right.
So
which
those
which
are
quickly
deteriorated
they
are
called
perishable
right,
and
many
of
the
foods
come
under
this
umbrella
that
many
foods
are
perishable,
or
most
of
the
foods
are
perishable.
Perishability
may
be
different
depending
on
the
food
product
itself
right
whether
it
is
naturally
available
or
whether
it
is
being
processed
even
then
perishability
also
come
in
right.
So
those
which
deteriorate
with
time
or
early
they
are
quickly
they
are
called
perishable
right,
then
semi
perishable
foods
the
best
example
is
egg,
because
you
see
again
nature
is
our
best
friend
the
nature
is
not
the
enemy
nature
is
our
best
friend
nature
has
created
such
that
egg
because
from
the
egg
if
it
is
hatched
then
there
will
be
the
young
depending
on
what
egg
it
is
right.
So
if
it
is
chicken,
egg
then
it
will
be
that
the
chicken
will
be
hatched
and
it
will
produce
some
young
for
that
nature
has
created
1
shell
over
that
because
in
inside
if
you
see
in
terms
6
of
fat
protein
carbohydrate
and
all
others
everything
is
there.
And
this
will
be
converted
into
a
living
scene
and
animal
kitchen;
sorry
and
animal
chicken
will
be
produced.
So
there
it
is
nature
given
that
the
shell
is
providing
is
provided
such
that
these
materials
are
protected,
so
that
is
what
we
call
semi
perishable
right.
So
by
definition
we
call
it
to
be
those
contains
natural
inhibitors
to
spoilage
for
example,
egg
and
root
vegetables
these
are
normally
under
the
umbrella
of
semi
perishable,
or
have
received
some
type
of
mild
preservation
treatment
which
creates
greater
tolerance
to
the
environment
conditions
and
abuse
during
handling
and
distribution.
For
example,
pasteurized
or
smoking
or
pickling
all
these
right,
normal
as
we
get
earlier
example
of
normal
milk
if
it
is
in
the
hot
summer
kept
then
it
is
gets
spoiled
right,
but
if
the
same
milk
is
pasteurized
(why
do
we
pasteurize
will
come
afterwards),
but
still
since
it
has
come
why
do
we
pasteurize
pasteurized
this
was
termed
as
per
the
name
of
the
inventor
Pasteur
Louis
Pasteur .
So
he
showed
that
if
things
are
pasteurized
liquid
foods
are
pasteurized
then
the
chance
of
getting
ill
or
infected
is
minimum.
So
what
pasteurization
is
done
doing
it
is
killing
all
the
pathogenic
organisms
pathogenic
mean
those
which
are
causing
disease.
So
disease
producing
organisms
are
getting
killed
by
the
process
pasteurization
right.
So
we
can
then
keep
it
for
some
time,
because
the
milk
which
you
had
originally
heated,
I
said
earlier
you
had
boiled
and
may
be
kept
and
consumed
may
be
after
couple
of
hours.
So
by
that
time
many
organisms
might
grown
in
that,
but
they
might
not
be
pathogenic.
So
in
pasteurization
your
fundamental
thing
is
that
you
will
kill
all
the
pathogenic
organisms
which
causes
diseases
and
you
are
not
allowing
any
organisms
to
grow
then
after
semi
perishable
foods.
7(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:45)
Let
us
define
some
more
like
shelf
stable
foods
right
in
many
houses,
now
a
days
of
course
after.
So
much
urbanization
things
have
not
become
you
might
not
have
come
across.
So
frequently
but
at
least
during
our
childhood
we
had
seen
that
many
people
used
to
buy
lot
of
bora;
bora
means
that
that
container
where
rice
is
kept
right,
that
bag
gunny
bag
in
that
rice
is
kept
for
months
together ,
so
people
used
to
buy
the
entire
lot
maybe
because
they
are
buying
a
lot
at
a
time.
So,
some
concession
some
advantage
might
be
obtaining,
so
that
is
not
now
a
days
because
ours
storage
space
is
also
not,
so
much
available
as
earlier
everything.
So
what
do
we
are
referring
is
that
shelf
stable
food
means
which
are
by
itself
stable
right
those
are
non
perishable
at
room
temperature
for
example,
cereals,
grains,
nuts,
or
receive
some
kind
of
preservation
treatment
for
example,
canning,
you
might
have
seen
and
taken
some
canned
foods
right,
and
this
canned
foods
are
again
boiled
for
definite
time
temperature
combination.
So
that
organisms
whatever
it
be
is
destroyed
and
they
are
available
for
around
the
year
today’ s
period
is
very
high,
so
that
is
why
they
may
be
termed
as
shelf
stable
right,
processed
to
reduce
moisture
content
for
example,
dried
foods
dried
foods
are
also
shelf
stables
because
one
of
the
factor
why
organisms
will
go,
organisms
will
grow
is
what
is
the
moisture
present
in
that?
How
much
moisture
is
available
for
the
organism
to
grow ,
if
you
are
removing
them
by
the
process
called
dry,
then
you
are
bringing
down
the
moisture
content
to
the
level
where
organisms
cannot
grow ,
and
this
is
called
your
shelf
stable
then
some
other
definitions
likes
8
dry
storage
that
is
storage
at
20
°C,
or
50
%
RH
cool
storage
that
is
storage
below
12
°C,
refrigerated
storage.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:53)
That
is
storage
between
0
to
8
°C,
then
freezer
storage
that
is
storage
between
0
to
minus
23
°C,
I
am
just
coming
shelf
life
time
duration
between
processing
and
consumption,
light
protected
that
is
the
kept
in
dark
or
protected
from
visual
light
or
wrapped
with
aluminum
foil
that
prevents
light
reactions
right.

So
under
all
these
will
come
this
today;
it
may
not
be
possible
to
go
there,
but
will
come
next
time,
but
till
now
whatever
we
have
defined
under
that
you
see
refrigerator
storage
we
have
said
0
to
-23°C
right,
I
since
in
this
class
time
is
almost
over.
But
I
will
carry
forward
it
to
the
next
and
bring
this
topic
again
that
why
we
are
saying
it
be
-23
°C
or
around
that
-23,
25,
30
°C
this
word
-18°C
,
where
why
it
has
come
you
will
see
most
of
the
books
that
present
storage
is
at
or
below
minus
18
°C
in
most
of
the
books
any
book
you
follow
you
come
across
this
that
in
most
of
the
books
it
is
said
minus
18
or
below
why
the
number
minus
18
right.
So
this
we
will
discuss
in
the
next
class
a
little
because
some
study
may
be
said
so
that
you
understand
easily .
Thank
you.
