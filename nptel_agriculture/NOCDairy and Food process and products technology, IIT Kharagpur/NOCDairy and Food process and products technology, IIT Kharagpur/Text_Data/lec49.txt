49 
Types
of
Available
Milk
in
the
Market
So,
we
are
continuing
on
the
different
milk
available
in
the
market,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
is
the
49
class
and
again
continuation
of
the
types
of
milk
which
are
available
in
the
market
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
some
more
like
evaporated
milk
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:44)
So,
evaporated
milk
is
concentrated
sterilized
milk,
it
has
50%
liquid
evaporated.
It
50%
of
its
liquid
is
evaporated
and
it
is
homogenized
then
canned,
sterilized
and
cooled
right.
So,
this
we
have
said
earlier
also,
that
50%
of
the
of
the
water
is
evaporated
right
so,
but
that
was
sweet
that
was
sweetened
right.
Now
non
sweetened
evaporated
milk
is
also
available
and
to
the
tune
of
50%
water
is
removed
and
that
is
called
condensed
milk
and
earlier
we
had
said.
but
that
was
sweetened
condensed,
but
in
this
case
it
could
be
also
a
non
sweetened.
But
generally
condensed
milks
are
sweetened
then
the
reason
being
that
if
sugar
is
added
to
that,
then
that
serves
both
1
sweetening
as
well
as
the
preservatives.
So,
for
that
reason
sweetening
is
required
and
preservative
is
not
externally
added,
then
like
here
it
has
come
that
condensed
milk
right.
So,
condensed
milk
is
evaporated
milk
with
added
sugar ,
sugar
makes
up
to
50%
of
the
content
and
it
does
not
need
to
be
sterilized
because
the
sugar
helps
to
preserve
it.
Both
of
this
milk
can
be
made
with
whole
semi
skimmed
or
skimmed
milk
right
do
you
remember
earlier
we
had
said
for
2%
that
is
the
semi
skimmed
right
or
whole
milk
which
we
also
said
earlier
3.25%
or
even
more
3.5%
standard
milk.
So,
depending
on
the
locality
depending
on
the
controlling
agency ,
this
fat
content
varies
widely
all
over
the
world
right.
But
the
basic
thing
that
skimmed
means
you
have
removed
the
fat
whole
nothing
as
being
removed
partially
skimmed;
that
means,
whether
you
how
much
you
have
removed
whether
it
is
2%,
1.5%
like
that
depending
on
you
that
you
call
it
to
be
semi
skimmed
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
03:50)
Then
process
technology
for
the
manufacturing
of
the
dried
milk
another
very
important
one.
Because
dried
milk
you
have
seen
from
your
childhood
that
you
are
apart
from
the
adult
people
are
taking
liquid
milk,
you
have
seen
people
are
also
feeding
young
this
dried
milk.
Red
milk
powder
or
baby
milk
baby
food
all
these
are
made
from
the
basic
milk
these
are
all
milk
products.
2
So,
dried
milk
is
one
of
the
very
important
milk
product
which
is
not
only
locality
dependent,
it
is
not
locality
dependent
it
is
available
all
over
the
world
because
primarily
this
is
as
dried
milk
is
associated
with
baby
food
or
baby
I
mean
milk
dried
milk
right.
So,
meant
for
the
meant
for
the
young
babies
right.
In
that
case
raw
milk
on
arrival
at
the
factory
is
tested
rapidly
for
number
one
what
is
the
temperature,
this
are
primary
factors
because
if
the
temperature
goes
up
during
bringing,
then
there
maybe
chances
of
milk
getting
spoil
or
some
organisms
may
get
developed.
So,
that
is
why
the
temperature
measurement
is
one
of
the
criteria.
Then
the
hygiene.
How
good
it
was
hygiene
content
that
is
because
maybe
the
container
is
shrubby
that
it
may
it
may
induce
some
infection
into
the
milk
and
that
is
not
desirable
right.
Then
antibiotic
level
that
is
also
required.
Because
in
many
cases
nowadays
this
cow
is
injected
with
antibiotics
so,
that
either
the
yield
is
more
or
the
milk
is
stayed
for
a
longer
time.
So,
that
is
also
not
desirable.
Then
what
are
addition?
Because
in
most
of
the
cases
this
adulteration
in
major
cases
adulteration
could
be
by
adding
water
of
course,
by
adding
water
means
your
fat
content
will
go
down
right.
So,
these
are
when
all
the
things
are
tested
right
and
adulteration
is
also
tested
if
there
is
any
adulterant
if
that
is
also
identified
and
revoked
then
only
you
have
the
whole
milk
available
for
making
your
dried
milk.
Remember
this
dried
milk
vis
a
vis
baby
food
is
synonym,
because
I
do
not
know
how
many
of
you
have
seen
that
of
course,
now
it
is
given
for
making
tea
that
dried
milk
powders
are
available.
But
hopefully
it
is
not
so
much
popular
or
so,
much
wide
as
the
liquid
milk
right.
But
the
dried
milk
in
the
form
of
baby
food
is
not
only
popular
it
is
essential
because
when
after
couple
of
months
when
the
milk
availability
is
going
down
that
time
this
external
milk
helps
the
baby
to
sustain
or
to
make
the
required
growth
right.
So,
on
acceptance
of
all
these
when
the
milk
has
come
from
outside,
these
temperature
these
quality
in
terms
of
antibiotics
hygiene
water
content
or
your
adulterants
if
all
these
check
is
over
if
the
milk
is
found
suitable,
then
you
bring
the
milk
when
it
is
accepted
and
pump
in
into
a
silo.
Because
when
you
are
we
are
talking
dried
milk,
you
need
to
dry
huge
quantity
of
milk
otherwise
it
will
not
be
economically
viable.
So,
the
before
it
goes
to
the
drier.
So,
lot
of
milk
you
are
keeping
in
one
place
right
and
that
is
in
silo
right
big
containers
they
are
called
silo
right.
So,
this
milk
pumped
into
the
silo
or
that
is
called
for
storage
tank
right.
3And
at
before
the
processing
plant
it
goes
to
the
processing
plant,
this
can
be
held
at
7°C
or
a
minimum
of
5°C.
5
degree
the
lower
the
temperature
better
it
is
we
have
said
earlier
also.
So,
5
degree
is
better
than
7
degree.
So,
if
possible
4-5°C,
this
silo
temperature
is
maintained
because
you
do
not
know
when
this
milk
will
be
going
for
the
processing.
Like
so
many
big
silos
are
there,
which
are
getting
filled
by
the
incoming
milk
and
this
milk
go
for
getting
dried
right.
So,
that
drying
process
before
it
takes
place
you
are
storing
the
milk
which
is
accepted
right
that
milk
which
has
been
accepted
by
the
quality
control
people
and
then
this
milk
is
kept
at
low
temperature
for
4-5°C,
till
it
is
going
for
the
processing
right.
Then
milk
is
standardized,
because
it
is
not
that
one
batch
earlier
also
we
said
one
batch
we
will
have
one
fat
content,
another
batch
we
will
have
another
fat
content
or
solid
not
fat
content,
that
is
not
desirable.
So,
you
have
to
standardize
and
this
standardization
is
based
on
what
you
want
whether
you
want
skimmed
milk
powder
or
whole
milk
powder
depending
on
that
you
have
standardized
your
milk
right.
So,
this
contains
now
you
know
so,
much
fat
so,
much
solid
not
fat.
So,
this
fat
to
solid
not
fat
ratio,
that
you
have
already
decided
and
accordingly
you
have
standardized
right.
Then
the
microbial
quality
of
the
milk
because
that
way
you
can
do
with
the
with
the
with
the
microbial
analysis
that;
what
is
the
microbial
load
or
the
milk
powder
right
the
microbial
quality
of
the
milk
powder
is
very
important
and
it
is
possible
at
this
early
stage
of
processing
to
take
out
99.9
percent
of
the
microbial
load.
That
is
possible
not
by
heating
right
if
you
want
because
heating
is
a
very
costly
process,
heating
is
a
costly
process.
4(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:00)
So,
by
now
this
99.9
percent
spore
formers
or
bacteria
that
can
be
taken
off
either
by
bacto
fugation
or
maybe
by
microfiltration
prior
to
the
heat
treatment
and
this
microfiltration
is
done
by
the
molecular
sieve
or
by
the
filtration
right
by
microfiltration.
So,
that
is
done
with
the
help
of
the
smaller
membrane
having
small
holes
and
through
that
the
microbes
can
be
filtered
right.
So,
this
microfiltration
can
be
done
and
can
be
removed
can
removed
rather
most
of
the
majority
of
the
spore
forming
organism.
Then
the
dryer
will
not
have
that
much
load
in
terms
of
microbial
content
right.
So,
this
is
one
of
the
vital
step,
but
because
of
the
price
constraint
many
of
the
processors
do
not
follow
such
kind
of
thing
right.
So,
they
directly
put
into
the
dryer .
So,
that
let
it
be
whatever
is
there,
but
it
is
not
it
should
not
be
it
is
better
if
you
can
remove
the
major
microbial
load
or
spore
former
even
by
the
microfiltration
then
that
helps
your
next
step
that
is
drying
step
much
more
smoother
much
more
easier
right.
This
milk
is
the
milk
is
high
temperature
short
time
pasteurized
right
milk
is
pasteurized
at
high
temperature
short
time,
HTST
by
72°C
at
holding
15
seconds
right
holding
time
is
15
seconds,
72°C
that
is
HTST .
But
in
many
cases
nowadays
the
people
do
keep
it
for
more
than
15
seconds
around
20,
25,
30
seconds
or
even
35
seconds
the
holding
time
they
make
it.
Because
nowadays
many
heat
resistant
spore
formers
are
also
coming
one
such
is
called
MAP
and
that
is
Mycobacterium
avium
subspecies
of
tuberculum
right.
5
So,
tuberculosis
is
formed
and
that
organism
is
very
very
heat
sensitive
heat
resistant
and
that
is
why
this
pasteurization
is
done
at
72°C,
but
for
more
than
15
seconds
maybe
25-
35
seconds
whatever
combination
you
have
right
that
is
done.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
15:18)
Then
that
microbacterium
paratuberculosis
that
is
there
and
maybe
capable
of
surviving
the
pasteurization
temperature
or
process.
In
skimmed
milk
powder
the
extent
of
heat
treatment
and
holding
time
that
can
be
measured
by
the
whey
protein
nitrogen
index.
Now
another
term
we
are
coming
across
is
called
whey
protein
nitrogen
index
or
WPNI
right.
This
whey
protein
nitrogen
index
is
associated
with
the
skim
milk
powder
right.
How
much
you
have
heated
that
time
temperature
combination
that
can
be
predicted
by
the
WPNI
number
Whey
Protein
Nitrogen
Index.
This
is
a
number
right
which
measures
the
amount
of
un
denatured
whey
protein.
Because
if
you
have
undenatured
whey
protein
more
that
means,
your
heat
treatment
was
less
and
if
you
have
undenatured
whey
protein
less
that
means,
heat
treatment
was
very
high.
So,
this
WPNI
is
a
measure
of
that
un
denatured
whey
protein
and
this
is
very
very
useful
parameter
for
judging
that
how
the
quality
of
the
dried
product
is
right.
Homogenization
is
not
mandatory
in
this
case
because
whole
milk
or
butter
milk
processing,
but
is
usually
applied
in
order
to
decrease
the
free
fat
content.
In
this
case
when
you
are
6
making
it
then
homogenization
may
not
be
required
the
reason
being
that
you
are
making
it
dried
right.
So,
homogenization
why
we
make?
Because
the
fat
comes
out
from
the
milk
but
when
is
dried
water
is
not
there.
So,
that
is
not
getting
separated.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
not
essential.
but
in
many
cases
it
is
done,
because
this
remove
the
chance
of
the
free
fat
content
that
chance
is
reduced.
The
milk
is
concentrated
in
a
series
of
calandrias.
Now
calandrias
in
earlier
perhaps
I
also
referred
earlier
that,
there
are
many
vertical
tubes
like
this
in
the
calandria
maybe
in
a
drum
right
in
a
drum
like
that
there
are
many
vertical
tubes
through
which
in
one
surface
this
liquid
drops
like
this,
and
in
another
surface
the
steam
is
passed
at
high
temperature
right
this
is
called
evaporator
calandria
and
this
type
of
evaporator
is
available
for
concentrating
right.
So,
in
this
you
are
concentrating
up
to
40
to
60%
of
the
solids
right
up
to
40
to
60%
solid
content
you
are
concentrating
prior
to
the
spray
drying,
because
this
is
reducing
the
load
on
the
spray
drier
right.
Most
milk
evaporators
are
today
of
the
following
film
type
right
this
is
called
this
calandrias,
most
of
the
evaporators
are
like
that
that
film
forms
on
this
and
for
and
heating
is
done
on
the
other
side
by
the
by
the
steam
right.
So,
most
of
the
evaporators
are
nowadays
falling
film
type,
where
fine
film
or
milk
concentrate
is
passed
down
the
tubes
wetting
the
surface
whilst
steam
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
tube
and
the
vapours
extracted
from
the
centre
by
vacuum
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:52)
7
Vapours
are
normally
recompressed
in
a
vapour
recompressor ,
making
evaporators
very
efficient.
Now
you
imagine
that
we
said
that
you
have
this
kind
of
calandrias
say
this
is
the
tube
and
in
this
you
have
in
one
side
milk
film
and
in
the
other
side
your
steam.
So,
vapour
is
coming
out
and
this
vapour
is
what
had
very
high
temperature,
maybe
depending
on
the
pressure,
maybe
closer
to
100
degree
right.
So,
if
you
can
utilize
these
vapour ,
then
your
pressure
on
evaporator
goes
down.
So,
this
vapour
is
reutilized
and
that
is
why
it
is
called
re
compressor
right.
So,
this
is
why
the
vapour
recompressor
that
makes
the
evaporator
very
much
efficient.
So,
water
from
the
evaporators
can
be
recovered
and
reused
evaporation
of
the
milk
prior
to
drying
is
done
for
reasons
of
energy
efficiency ,
as
it
is
far
cheaper
to
evaporate
the
water
when
the
spray
with
respect
to
the
spray
dry
right
you
compare
to
spray
drying
that
evaporation
is
much
cheaper .
The
energy
used
in
multi
pass
evaporators
with
steam
vapour
recompression
is
about
10
times
less
than
the
spray
drying
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:09)
So,
spray
drying
is
highly
costly
see
if
that
with
vapour
recompression
system
if
you
can
concentrate
first,
and
then
if
you
can
send
it
for
the
drying,
then
your
drying
efficiency
goes
up
and
the
spray
drying
can
be
much
better ,
so
right.

So,
this
is
to
be
done,
but
again
as
I
said
in
majority
of
the
cases,
this
type
of
typical
good
processes
are
not
being
followed
the
reason
was
known
to
them,
but
it
is
advisable
that
it
should
be.
Spray
drying
of
milk
spray
drying
of
milk
powder
involves
atomizing
concentrated
milk
or
other
liquids
into
a
hot
air
stream
of
around
180
to
220°C.
This
atomizer
may
be
either
a
pressure
nozzle
or
maybe
a
centrifugal
disc
either
of
this
either
a
small
pressure
nozzle
through
which
it
moves,
maybe
a
centrifugal
disc
right.
By
controlling
the
size
of
the
droplets
the
air
temperature
and
the
airflow ,
it
is
possible
to
you
operate
almost
all
the
moisture
right
while
exposing
the
solids
to
relatively
low
temperatures,
spray
drying
yields
milk
powders
with
excellent
solubility
flavour
colour
etcetera
this
is
the
most
common
procedure
for
manufacturing
milk
powders
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:14)
Then
the
spray
drying
process
is
typically
this
spray
drying
process
is
typically
a
2
stage
process
that
involves
number
1
the
spray
dryer
at
the
first
stage
with
a
static
fluid
bed
integrated
in
the
base
of
the
drying
chamber
and
the
second
stage
is,
an
external
vibrating
fluid
bed
right.
This
product
here
product
is
removed
through
the
2
stage
process
quickly
to
prevent
overheating
of
the
powder .
Overheating
if
it
is
done
that
again
the
WPNI
that
may
go
up
that
is
why
protein
nitrogen
index
or
the
product
may
become
some
colour
may
develop
which
is
not
desirable
right.
Then
it
enters
a
system
called
it
enters
a
system
called
cyclone
that
simultaneously
cools
the
powder
also
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:30)9
Then
some
new
technologies
in
dairy
industry
which
are
nowadays
used
ok.
But
hopefully
today
in
this
class
we
may
not
be
able
to
continue
for
a
long
because
our
time
is
also
now
getting
limited,
but
even
then
let
me
let
me
let
be
summarize
in
that
that
in
the
sprint
right
now,
in
this
case
you
will
see
that
the
dried
milk
in
many
cases
this
dried
milk
the
rehydration
may
not
be
that
good
right.
You
take
some
powder
put
it
into
water
and
you
will
see
that
it
forms
lumps.
The
moment
a
lamp
is
formed;
that
means,
the
outside
of
that
is
with
water ,
but
it
is
not
able
to
penetrate
right.
So,
if
the
lamp
is
formed
then
it
will
not
be
that
good.
So,
that
is
why
that
spray
dried
is
not
made
to
a
very
very
fine,
in
some
in
many
times
it
is
being
formed
as
the
globules
so,
that
the
rehydration
becomes
very
easy.
Because
your
ultimate
purpose
is
there
not
the
dried
milk
is
to
be
consumed,
whether
it
is
in
the
form
of
making
tea,
whether
it
is
in
the
form
of
taking
milk
or
making
rehydrating
it
to
milk
right
or
reconstitution,
this
is
called
reconstituted
milk
or
any
such
or
may
be
food
whatever
it
be,
in
that
case
the
rehydration
that
is
that
milk
which
you
are
producing
that
should
be
very
easily
done
and
it
is
1
to
1
means
if
you
take
1
kg
of
powder
then
corresponding
8
to
10
kgs
of
liquid
milk
you
should
get
that
is
the
idea
right.
But
in
many
cases
if
the
powder
is
getting
lump,
then
your
product
is
not
getting
sold.
So,
people
are
taken
this
into
consideration
and
many
cases
the
small
globules
very
small
of
course,
minute
globular
forms
are
made
whose
this
rehydration
capacity
or
capability
is
very
10
high.
And
they
do
rehydrate
and
make
almost
all
the
milk
converted
into
liquid
milk
and
that
is
used
as
the
either
baby
food
or
any
other
right.
So,
in
that
case
of
course,
baby
food
you
it
is
not
only
the
dried
milk.
but
also
some
other
characteristics
are
also
associated.
I
am
not
discussing
in
particular
baby
food
because
that
becomes
very
much
specific
in
the
there
also
it
contains
some
fat
content,
then
fat
to
protein
or
fat
to
this
nonfat
dried
that
is
SNF
that
has
to
be
solid
not
fat,
that
has
to
be
fat
to
SNF
ratio,
that
for
the
for
the
for
the
baby
food
is
definite
and
not
only
that
some
additional
sweetening
agent
is
also
given
so,
that
the
this
becomes
accept
acceptable
to
the
baby
right.
However ,
in
all
the
cases
that
rehydration
of
the
powders
is
a
backbone
or
primary
because
that
is
to
be
sold
to
the
market
right.
So,
with
this
of
different
types
of
milk
and
milk
products,
we
will
finish
this
class
and
next
we
will
go
to
not
only
in
dairy ,
but
also
in
process
industry
nowadays
many
types
or
many
instruments
are
being
used
we
will
discuss
some
of
them.
Thank
you.
