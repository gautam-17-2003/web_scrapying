Food
Laws
in
India
So
we
are
discussing
the
food
laws
why
should
be,
where
it
should
be,
how
it
should
be?
Right,
we
also
saw
that
codex
international
this
regulatory
items
or
laws
they
are
being
followed
by
many
countries;
the
reason
being
there
also
comprising
of
the
international
bodies
like
FAO,
or
WHO
or
UN,
all
these
big
organizations
are
in
the
apex
body
of
this.
So
we
said
that
for
a
country
whether
it
is
developed
or
developing
or
underdeveloped
anywhere;
the
country
can
have
the
it
is
that
it
can
either
accept
those
international
things,
just
like
that
as
a
whole
or
can
change
them
or
introduce
some
new
things
or
delete
according
to
the
requirement,
according
to
the
situation,
according
to
the
condition
of
that
country
right.
In
this
aspect,
we
came
a
in
the
last
class
about
the
food
safety
right
and
we
said
that
food
safety
is
such
a
word
wide
word.
Which
a
encompasses
many
things
right
food
safety
can
also
be
in
terms
of
supply
of
the
food
right,
maybe
all
laws
and
other
things
are
everything
maintained,
but
food
is
not
available
then;
that
is
also
a
safety
for
the
people
who
are
the
consumer .
So
it
is
not
only
in
the
bad
sense
of
mis-utilizing
loss
or
undermining
the
orders
or
overlooking
the
regulations
this
is
also
true
that,
we
also
said
of
course,
that
quality
is
also
we
said
this
quality
of
the
food.
But
the
supply
is
also
another
term
another
thing
which
comes
under
this
umbrella
of
the
safety
that
how
food
can
be
made
available
to
all
the
people
everywhere
right,
there
also
brings
the
safety;
food
safety
in
terms
of
not
consumption
in
terms
of
availability
right,
but
by
and
large
when
laws
and
orders
are
coming
into
then
it
is
more
in
terms
of
this
safe
that
is
micro
well
safe
is
safetyness
we
talk
about
or
in
terms
of
the
quality
parameters
we
talk
about
right.
That
consuming
food
people
should
not
be
in
anyway
effected,
whatever
be
the
way;
be
it
microbial
,
be
it
your
energy
consumption,
or
be
it
or
energy
availability ,
or
be
it
by
the
what
is
said
that
their
nutritional
conditions
of
the
food
right.
So
we
came
to
that
we
in
our
country
in
India
in
2006
this
parliament
imposed
assembly
of
all
the
earlier
laws
and
standards,
which1we
were
there
to
1
place
and
that
is
called
food
safety
and
securities
order
or
act
food
safety
and
securities
act
2006.
We
said
based
on
that
an
organization
had
come
up
that
is
called
FSSAI
and
who
is
taking
now
all
the
responsibilities,
all
the
framing
of
the
laws
and
orders
and
how
to
control
how
to
monitor ,
and
how
to
implement
all
this
things
are
coming
into
there.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:38)
So
if
we
said
we
said
that
oh
some
more
orders
we
left
out;
if
we
remember
we
had
said
many ,
and
since
there
was
shortage
of
time
some
more
orders
which
are
also
under
this
FSS
act.
They
are
milk
and
milk
products
order
1992;
they
are
also
repeated
after
commencement
of
the
Food
Safety
and
Standards
Act,
2006,
under
this
umbrella
of
Food
Safety
and
Standards
Act
2006,
the
Food
Safety
and
Standards
Authority
of
India
or
FSSAI
has
been
established
which
consolidates
various
acts
and
orders
that
have
either
to
handled
food
related
issues
in
various
ministries
and
departments.
The
purpose
of
willing
this
body
or
regulatory
institute
or
organization
is
that
to
lay
down
science
based
standards
for
articles
of
food,
different
articles
of
food
and
to
regulate
their
manufacture,
storage,
distribution,
sale
and
import
to
ensure
availability
of
safe
and
wholesome
food
for
human
consumption.
So
basically
these
2
are
the
primary
reason
why?
That
is
to
lay
down
science
based,
standards
for
articles
of
food
and
to
regulate
their
manufacture,
storage,
distribution,
sale
and
import
to
ensure
availability
of
safe
and
wholesome
food
for
human
consumption.2
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:12)
That
has
become
the
primary
concerned
about
of
the
FSSAI.
So
we
can
say
that
FSSAI
is
entrusted
with
following
functions
to
perform.
Number
1
the
framing
of
regulations
to
lay
down
the
standards
and
guidelines;
standards
also
associated
with
the
guidelines
that
the
standards
and
guidelines
in
relation
to
articles
of
food
and
specifying
typically
appropriate
system
of
enforcing
this
various
standards
right,
then
laying
down
mechanism
and
guidelines
for
accreditation.
This
is
accreditation
is
means
you
are
saying
or
you
are
giving
some
people,
some
organizations
authentication
so
that
they
can
act
for
you
that
is
well
what
is
accreditation;
right.
So,
guidelines
for
accreditation
of
certification
bodies
so
there
these
also
being
done
by
this
FSSAI
engaged
in;
certification
of
food
safety ,
management
system
for
food
business
and
third
one
is
laying
up
or
laying
down
procedure
and
guideline
for
accreditation
of
laboratories
and
notification
of
the
accredited
laboratories.
So
laboratories
meaning
where
I
still
remember
one
fact
that
at
some
point
of
time
maybe
couple
of
decades
back,
suddenly
some
people
to
asked
I
am
not
saying
the
other
things
right
the
fact
is
some
people
came
with
some
sample,
that
it
is
aliased
by
the
police
that
this
people
are
mixing
one
with
the
other
it
was
oil;
one
with
the
other .
Whether
it
was
and
those
people
only
came
forward
and
that
whether
it
is
really
a
mixture
or
blending
of
one
or
two
or
many
or
what
are
those
to
identify
them
came
forward
to
us.
Then
though
we
could,
but
since
it
afterwards
will
go
to
the
court
that
is
law
that
bigger
umbrella3
court
for
different
to
different
reasons
beyond
our
knowledge.
So
those
things
who
will
certify
are
we
empowered
to
do
that?.
Yes
we
are
academicians
we
can
definitely
find
out;
what
are
the
things,
what
are
the
right
and
what
are
the
wrong
things,
but
we
are
not
entitled
we
are
not
certified,
we
are
not
entrusted,
we
are
not
authorized
by
controlling
bodies,
controlling
organizations.
So
we
had
to
say
the
situation
that
though
we
can,
but
that
in
the
eye
of
court
or
law
it
will
not
stand
because
we
do
not
have
any
such
authentication
to
certify .
So
that
is
what
how
when
in
what
way
organizations
can
be
accredited.
So,
that
means,
they
can
be
identified,
recognized
such
that
they
can
perform
such
tests
or
such
discrepancies
could
be
answered
by
those
organizations
and
they
are
called
accredited
bodies
right.
So
these
are
the
two,
three
reasons
why
FSSAI
was
established
we
have
discussed.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:16)
Some
more
we
can
say
to
provide
scientific
advice
and
technical
support
to
Central
Government
and
State
Governments
in
the
matters
of
framing
the
policy
and
rules
in
areas
which
have
a
direct
or
indirect
bearing
of
food
safety
and
nutrition
right.
Yes
if
depending
on
the
country
whether
it
is
a
central
lead
controlled
by
the
country
people
or
maybe
there
is
a
apex
central
body
and
there
may
be
sub
bodies
like
states
and
others.
So
depending
on
where
it
is
and
how
it
is
to
be
applied
right.
4
So
when
we
are
talking
about
FSSAI
definitely
we
can
directly
tell
that
we
have
both
the
central
as
well
as
state
governments.
So
technically
the
government
should
be
these
kind
of
Central
or
State
Governments
should
be
properly
guided,
or
technically
guided,
scientifically
guided,
how
we
to
impose
the
laws
or
regulations
as
well
to
frame
different
policies
right;
different
policies
do
come
up
at
different
times
we
have
you
have
noticed.
So
how
to
frame
those
policies,
how
to
nurture
those
policies
or
how
to
implement
those
policies,
as
well
how
to
control
those
kind
of
policies
these
are
to
be
governed
by
the
basis
of
scientific
knowledge
and
this
is
to
be
supported
by
the
FSSAI.
Some
other
like
to
collect
and
collate
that
are
regarding
food
consumption,
incidence
and
prevalence
of
biological
risk,
contaminates
in
food
residues,
contaminates
in
food
residues
of
various
food
source;
contaminates
in
food
products,
identification
of
emer ging
risk
and
introduction
of
rapid
alert
system.
So
though
our
time
limits
are
there,
but
still
there
are
certain
things
which
unless
we
discuss
here
we
will
remain
untold.
You
see
you
are
saying
that
biological
risk
or
contaminants
in
food
right,
now
yes
in
the
eye
of
law
or
court
in
the
court
things
may
or
may
not
be
different
like;
so
1
product,
1
food
product
is
contaminated,
then
the
automatic
question
comes
if
the
food
product
is
contaminated
whether
it
is
contaminated
or
not?
So
we
will
do
this
job
those
accredited
laboratories
they
will
find
out
that
the
level
of
contamination,
then
if
it
is
in
India.
So
we
are
talking
about
FSSAI,
so
it
is
under
India
FSSAI
is
one
apex
body
and
they
are
controlling
and
regulating
the
situations.
But
the
problem
comes
that
now
it
is
contaminated
established
by
it
some
already
recognized,
or
laboratories,
or
agencies;
who
are
competent
to
do
that.
Then
the
question
comes
it
is
conformed
it
is
contaminated.
Now
the
contamination
came
from
where?
During
the
production
of
that
particular
food
or
during
the
processing
or
during
the
transport
or
during
handling;
all
these
factors
do
come
up.
So
there
must
be
somebody
who
will
negotiate,
who
will
go
into
detail
of
these
problems
and
then
give
guidelines
to
the
respective
departments
or
respective
organizations
that
with
this
can
be
concluded
like
this,
this,
this,
and
it
may
be
within
the
limit
or
beyond
the
limit,
but
yes
every
contaminations
or
every
contaminants
do
have
its
own
limit.
Generally ,
if
you
have
seen
that
this
contaminants
are
in
allowed
in
the
in
terms
of
either
parts
per
million
PPM
or
in
parts
per
billion
depending
on
the
contaminant
right.
There
are
many
which
we
our
body
can
tolerate
a
little
a
higher
quantity ,
there
are
many
our
body5cannot
tolerate
even
in
very
small
quantities.
So
depending
on
the
contaminant
the
level
of
contamination
or
the
other
tolerance
of
the
contamination
can
be
different.
Now
this
FSSAI
or
this
kind
of
organizations,
who
are
the
controlling
agent,
they
will
make
the
scientific
guideline
to
the
controlling
body
or
to
the
deciding
bodies
to
take
the
right
decision.
So,
apart
from
that
to
collect
and
collate
data
regarding
food
consumption
incidence
and
prevalence
of
biological
risk
contaminants
in
food
residues
of
various
contaminants
Contaminants
in
food
products
identification
of
emer ging
risk
and
introduction
of
rapid
alert
system
all
these
are
to
be
guided
or
to
be
framed
by
the
food
safety
and
security
authorities
of
India
right.
Apart
from
this
some
other
like
to
provide
training
programs
for
persons
who
are
involved
or
intend
to
get
involved
in
food
business.
Now
you
see
food
business
again
is
a
big
and
wide
term
how
and
why?.
You
see
business
food
is
the
commodity ,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
business
it
starts
with
the
growth
or
cultivation;
agriculture
from
there
harvesting,
from
there
post
harvesting,
from
there
processing,
from
there
the
packaging
and
distribution,
from
there
the
retail.
So
all
these
stages
anywhere
any
part
contamination
might
have
occurred;
your
end
result,
your
laboratory
has
detected
the
contamination
and
also
the
level
of
contamination.
Maybe
that
is
within
the
limit
or
maybe
that
is
beyond
the
limit
that
is
all
together
different,
but
identified
that
this
contamination
is
there
is
a
contamination
or
this
contaminant
is
there.
Then
the
question
comes
how
much
is
the
tolerance
limit;
we
will
say
our
this
apex
body
has
already
framed
based
on
maybe
international
standards
or
may
is
based
on
your
local
depending
on
the
situation
is
already
framed.
And
then
it
comes
the
people
who
will
be
handling
this
situation
right
from
the
production
of
the
commodity
to
the
finished
product,
which
is
consumable
by
the
people,
by
the
consumer
all
these
stages
people
are
to
be
accounted
with
the
situation,
accounted
with
the
risk,
accounted
with
the
laws,
of
regulations.
So
that
can
be
done
by
framing
by
imparting
some
knowledge
through
some
training
program.
Who
will
dictate,
who
will
decide
on
that?
FSSAI
can
do
such
kind
of
things;
this
is
their
power
empowered
with
such
kind
of
a
deciding
facilities
or
deciding
authorities
right.
Then
we
come
to
that
what
else
FSSAI
need
to
do;
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
international
technical
standards
for
food,
sanitary ,
and
phyto-sanitary
standards.

So
to
contribute
to
the
development
of
international
technical
standards
of
food,
sanitary
and
phyto-sanitary
standards
and
to
promote
general
awareness
about
food
safety
and
food
standards;
this
is
one
of
the
biggest
umbrella
that
encompasses
everything.
That
awareness
program
country
like
India
where
I
am
not
going
to
say
anything
on
whether
it
is
true
or
false,
but
it
is
alleged
that
many
people
do
not
have
two
times
food
a
day
leaving
aside
three
to
four
times
or
exotic
and
other
foods
normal
very
requirement
basic
requirement
of
food
might
not
be
available
for
every
people
everywhere.
Then
think
appears
those
who
are
not
getting
availing
this
food
required
food
supply ,
then
they
certainly
will
go
for
taking
some
or
other
things
which
may
or
may
not
be
scientifically
acceptable
or
not.
So
if
some
people
some
organizations
they
can
vouch
for
these
safety
part
to
the
people
who
are
already
getting
or
those
who
are
not
getting;
then
the
spread
of
the
knowledge,
spread
of
the
requirement
of
the
safety
awareness,
spread
of
the
basis
of
safety
of
the
food
in
terms
of
micro
well,
in
terms
of
quality ,
all
aspects
are
to
be
introduced.
So,
who
will
do
this?
This
will
be
done
by
FSSAI
by
properly
training
many
organizations
many
people
by
giving
authority
to
certify
some
tests,
some
results,
which
may
or
may
not
be
acceptable
or
which
may
or
may
not
be
as
per
with
the
requirements.
So
those
results
are
to
be
certified,
those
results
have
to
be
authenticated
yes
this
contains
these,
these
materials.
So
how
they
have
found
out
those
procedures
at
also
to
be
standardized;
otherwise
I
because
I
7
hope
1
small
example
in
it
is
good
enough
to
understand
that
the
blood
sugar
people
do
for
very
adult
time
right.
In
the
earlier
days,
it
is
to
be
used
so
if
you
have
seen
that
chemistry
books
food
chemistry
or
any
other
that
Benedict’ s
reagent
as
reducing
or;
so
that
used
for
finding
out
this
blood
sugar
level.
But
with
time
this
is
getting
change
then
change
the
new
and
new
techniques,
new
and
new
instrumentations
are
coming
up.
So
if
I
measure
based
on
my
knowledge,
based
on
my
understanding
that
will
give
one
result,
one
value
and
another
organization
who
is
accredited
by
this
unique
body
FSSAI
they
will
measure
based
on
the
guidelines
given
by
FSSAI
and
there
there
cannot
be
any
controversy
in
that.
So
people
will
adhere
to
that
yes
this
is
the
recognized
body
who
have
done
it,
whose
values
are
like
that,
procedures
are
like
that,
methodologies
are
like
that
and
the
result
is
like
to
likely
to
be
correct.
So
this
all
these
all
rather
are
being
imposed,
are
being
implemented,
are
being
trained
by
the
body
called
FSSAI
and
they
are
also
framing
implementing
the
Food
Safety
Standards
Act,
2006
ok.
So
then
in
the
next
class
we
will
go
into
some
more
about
the
standards,
about
the
organizing
or
controlling
agencies.
Thank
you.
