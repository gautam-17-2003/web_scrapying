Milk
Protein
So
we
have
finished
the
basics
of
protein
and
amino
acids,
now
we
come
back
to
our
normal
class
of
that
Milk
Protein
right,
we
have
finished
milk
fat
and,
now
we
will
go
to
milk
protein.
So
in
our
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
class
in
lecture
number
29
we
come
back
to
milk
protein
right.
So
in
that
milk
protein,
when
we
are
talking
so
we
have
seen
that,
proteins
are
made
of
carbon,
hydrogen,
oxygen,
nitrogen,
sulphur ,
phosphorus
right.
So
that
sulphur ,
phosphorus
in
some
of
the
proteins
it
may
or
some
of
the
proteins
it
may
not
be,
but
normally
this
proteins
are
characterized
by
the
nitrogen
content
and
that
is
why
we
tend
the
protein
content
with
the
help
of
the
Kjeldahl
method,
and
there
we
get
the
nitrogen
and
with
the
conversion
factor
we
get
the
protein
right,
and
we
have
seen
that
proteins
are
made
of
amino
acids
with
specific
properties,
that
are
determined
by
the
side
chains
of
the
amino
acids
in
the
polypeptide
chain.
This
all
are
now
no
longer
Greek
to
us
because
we
have
completed
right,
and
confirmation
of
the
protein
depends
on
the
hydrogen
bonds,
hydrophobic
interactions
and
salt
bridges
formed
between
peptide
chains;
all
these
all
bridge
hydrophobic
or
hydrogen
bonds
or
peptide
bonds
these
also
we
have
covered
up
right.
So
regular
arrangements
include
beta
sheets
and
alpha
helices
right,
so
this
alpha
helices
and
beta
sheets
also
we
have
covered
in
our
previous
classes
right,
so
that
alpha
helices
where
it
is
like
a
helical
group
right.
So
helice
means
it
is
as
helices
we
know ,
so
this
is
like
this
and
this
is
one
and
another
is
like
that.
So
this
is
like
a
helical
group
it
appears
right
and
all
this
depends
on
the
temperature
ionic
strength
pH
that
affects
the
protein
conformation,
and
conformation
we
also
said
is
nothing
but
the
arrangement
or
the
special
arrangement
in
the
special
arrangement
of
the
functional
groups
of
the
molecule
that
is
the
conformation
of
the
particular
molecule
or
atom
or
system
right,
so
this
we
have
seen.
Now
let
us
look
into
that
normally
milk
contains
around
say
2.8
to
4
percent,
out
of
which
30
to
30;
2.8
or
2
4
percent
is
around,
say
30
to
35
grams
per
k
g
of
the
milk,
it
contains
protein
or
nitrogenous
compounds
and
remains
constant
because
normally
proteins
do
not
come
out
as
fat
we
have
seen,
if
we
just
keep
fat
just
like
that
standing
for
some
time
we
have
seen
that
fat
molecules
to
come
out
and
get
separated
from
the
milk,
and
because
of
that
the
fat
component
gets
depleted
right,
but
unlike
that
unless
you
are
heating
milk
this
protein
does
not
come
out
and
protein
remains
more
or
less
constant
in
the
milk
system
right.
So
this
is
influenced
by
the
lactation
stage
of
the
animal,
so
this
protein
content
also
depends
on
the
lactation
stage,
that
a
little
we
have
may
not
be
a
little
elaborately
also
we
have
discussed
earlier
right.
So
2
types
of
proteins
are
there,
one
is
called
casein,
which
contains
around
80
percent
and
lacto
or
lactalbumin
right.
Lactalbumin
or
which
is
known
as
whey
protein
or
serum
protein,
now
what
is
serum
what
is
plasma
those
things
also
we
have
covered
earlier
right.
So
this
contains
around
18
to
20
percent
of
the
whey
protein
of
the
total
protein
right,
and
they
some
derived
also
proteins
are
also
there
for
example,
lactoglobulin
which
is
may
be
around
0.05
to
0.07
percent
present
there
right.
Now
out
of
these
proteins
in
milk
that
is
casein
and
whey
protein
right,
casein
contains
80
percent,
whey
proteins
roughly
we
call
it
to
be
20
percent
80
percent
protein
and
25
casein
and
20
percent,
we
call
to
be
whey
protein
right
of
what
of
the
total
protein
present
to
milk
itself
contains
protein.
We
normally
call
it
to
be
around
4
percent
again
the
many
factors
are
responsible
for
this
variation
of
the
protein.
So
we
have
discussed
on
that.
So
assuming
out
of
4,
80
percent
this
casein
so
that
means,
around
3
to
4,
3
to
3.5
grams
of
protein
or
casein
per
100
gram
of
these
milk,
and
remaining
is
out
of
4.
So
remaining
0.521
gram
is
your
whey
protein
right
now
this
casein
there
are
4
types
of
casein,
they
are
having
its
variation
4
types
they
are
alpha
s
1,
casein
alpha
s
2
casein,
beta
casein
and
kappa
casein.
So
I
repeat
4
types
of
caseins
alpha
s
1
casein,
alpha
s
2
casein,
beta
casein
and
kappa
casein
these
4
types
are
there.
These
are
phosphorylated
and
hydrophobic
these
caseins
are
phosphorylated
and
hydrophobic
and
they
are
associated
with
themselves
and
each
other
right.
So
they
respond
they
represent
around
38
percent,
10
percent,
36
percent
and
13
percent
of
the
whole
casein
that
is
alpha
s
1
casein
is
38
percent,
alpha
s
2
casein
around
10
percent,
beta
casein
is
36
percent
and
kappa
casein
is
roughly
10
percent
right.
So
this
is
about
the
casein,
4
types
which
are
present
overall
21
variants
of
casein
have
been
identified
that
occurred
by
genetic
mutation
right,
caseins
have
distinct
disordered
molecular
structure
that
lack
disulfide
bridges
also
caseins
are
very
heat
stable
and
withstand
temperature
about
150
degree
centigrade
before
getting
dissociated
means
it
may
get
into
your
dissociation
means
denaturing
right.
So
denature
also
we
said
the
other
day
so
before
it
is
did
getting
dissociated
or
denature
or
degraded
that
it
is
around
150
degree
centigrade
it
can
withstand
right.
Hydrophobicity
is
due
to
the,
high
ratios
of
apolar
amino
acids.
So
those
amino
acids
which
are
not
polar
hydrophobicity
is
due
to
that
high
ratios
of
apolar
amino
acids,
apolarity
is
even
in
valine,
leucine,
isoleucine,
phenyl
phenylalanine
and
proline.
So
they
do
have
lot
of
apolarity
in
them
and
that
in
turn
is
influenced
to
the
protein.
That
is
this
hydrophobicity
of
the
casein
hydrophobicity
of
the
casein
is
due
to
the
apolarity
of
the
casein
molecule
that
is
the
high
ratios
of
apolar
amino
acids
in
which
we
have
seen
that
valine,
leucine,
isoleucine,
phenylalanine
and
proline
they
do
call
high
ratios
of
hydro
apolarity
right,
and
apolarity
ranges
between
35
to
45
percent
that
is
almost
50-50
is
the
polar
and
non
polar
right,
and
because
of
this
non
polarity
or
apolarity
they
do
react
or
they
do
behave
like
hydrophobic
in
nature
right.
Now
this
hydrophobicity
can
be
encountered
by
high
phosphate
content
if
there
be
if
there
be
high
phosphate
content
because
phosphate
is
a
hydrophilic
right,
phosphate
group
is
hydrophilic
very
much
hydrophilic.
So
that
will
encounter
the
hydrophobicity
if
that
is
present.
So
to
into
to
nullify
the
hydrophobicity
lot
of
phosphate
groups
if
can
be
it
if
lot
of
phosphate
group
it
can
be
present
in
the
protein
then
the
hydrophobicity
of
the
protein
can
be
reduced
that
is
you
are
that
one
way
to
counter
the
hydrophobicity
or
low
concentration
of
sulphur
containing
amino
acids
such
as
methionine
and
cysteine
that
allow
casein
to
be
reasonably
soluble
in
water
right.
So,
if
low
concentration
of
sulphur
containing
amino
acids
are
also
present
for
example,
they
are
present
we
have
seen
in
sulphur
in
methionine
and
cysteine.
So
if
small
quantity
of
methionine
and
cysteines
are
also
there
then
also
that
can
that
can
counter
the
hydrophobicity
or
hydrophobic
nature
of
the
protein
and
it
will
not
repel
water
to
that
extent
we
have
seen
it
is
around
35
to
45
percent
apolarity
that
is
hydrophobic
or
non
polar
systems
in
protein
right.
So
we
come
to
then
that
the
caseins
susceptibility
to
proteolysis
is
due
to
the
lack
of
secondary
and
tertiary
structures
of
alpha
casein
and
beta
casein
alpha
s
1
casein
and
beta
casein
because
of
them
they
do
not
have
the
secondary
and
tertiary
structures
so
much.
So
that
is
one
of
the
reason
why
the
proteolysis
that
is
break
down
of
protein
proteolysis
is
breakdown
of
protein
that
take
or
casein
that
casein
is
susceptible
to
proteolysis,
that
is
breakdown
of
the
casein
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
alpha
casein
alpha
s
1
casein
rather
because
we
have
not
only
alpha,
but
alpha
s
1
and
alpha
s
2.
So
out
of
that
alpha
s
1
casein
and
beta
casein
they
do
have
less
or
they
are
lacking
secondary
and
tertiary
structure.
So
that
is
why
the
hydro
that
is
why
the
proteolysis
of
casein
is
possible
right.
Now
what
is
alpha
s
1
casein
or
alpha
casein
right,
so
alpha
caseins
means
alpha
s
1
and
alpha
s
2
caseins.
So
if
you
look
at
alpha
s
1
casein
this
alpha
s
1
casein
is
having
199
amino
acids
and
is
approximately
around
23.6
kilo
dalton
in
length
right,
size
molecular
size
is
23.6
kilo
Dalton.
They ,
now
like
normally
we
say
the
lengths
in
millimetre,
metre,
then
micrometre,
then
nanometre.
But
these
molecules
are
being
said
in
terms
of
Dalton
and
they
are
around
23.6
kilo
Dalton
in
alpha
casein
around
this
is
average
around
199
amino
acids
are
present
highest
charge
of
all
the
casein
molecules.
So
it
has
maximum
charge
in
all
the
casein
molecules
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
said
that
when
you
have
the
freshly
drawn
milk
it
may
have
the
acidity
and
some
acidity
may
be
impacted
by
this
casein
molecules
right.
So
it
has
high
charge
that
is
alpha
s
1
casein,
this
consist
of
least
8
phosphoserine
units
right,
least
8
phosphoserine
units
it
has
17
proline
residues
that
ultimately
disrupt
the
formation
of
secondary
structure
such
as
alpha
helices
beta
sheets.
So
alpha
helices
beta
sheets
are
secondary
structure
so
because
of
the
17
proline
residues,
they
do
not
allow
the
formation
of
the
secondary
structures
like
alpha
helices
or
beta
sheets,
this
is
the
reason
why
alpha
casein
is
not
soluble
or
is
just
we
will
before
this
slide
we
had
said
in
the
previous
slide,
that
they
are
hydrophobic
right,
the
hydrophobicity
is
because
of
that
said
they
are
or
they
can
be
easily
that
is
dissociated
or
degraded
or
denatured
because
of
the
non
presence
of
the
secondary
and
tertiary
structures
right
alpha
s
1
casein
whereas
alpha
s
2
casein.
They
are
consisting
of
207
amino
acids
and
their
average
size
is
around
25.4
kilo
Dalton,
which
was
23.6
kilo
Dalton
in
alpha
s
1
here
it
is
25.4
kilo
Dalton.
So
least
hydrophobic
casein
molecule,
so
the
hydrophobicity
in
casein
that
is
beta
alpha
s
2
casein
is
the
minimum
hydrophobicity
that
is
it
is
not
that
bad
with
the
water
system
or
polar
system
right.
So
it
has
least
hydrophobicity
amongst
all
the
protein
amongst
all
the
forms
of
the
proteins
that
is
alpha
s
1
alpha
s
2
beta
and
kappa
casein
right,
and
it
has
several
genetic
variants
contain
between
10
to
13
phosphoserine
units
it
contains
between
10
to
13
phosphoserine
units
whereas,
in
alpha
s
1
it
was
around
17
phosphoserine
units
right
and
it
contains
2
cysteine
residues
right,
it
exists
as
a
dimer
in
milk
right
not
as
a
monomer
or
polymer
it
exists
in
milk
as
a
dimer
that
is
2
molecules
are
associated
as
dimer
right.
So
looking
at
alpha
s
1
and
alpha
s
2
casein
we
then
say
that
beta
casein
that
is
other
type
of
the
casein
that
contains
around
209
amino
acids,
and
approximate
size
is
around
24
kilo
Dalton
right,
it
has
the
most
hydrophobic
casein
molecule
it
has
the
most
hydrophobic
casein
molecule
the
hydrophobicity
if
you
remember
just
sometime
back
we
said
is
primarily
due
to
alpha
s
1
and
beta
casein
right,
and
beta
casein
has
the
highest
or
most
hydrophobicity
amongst
the
caseins
variety
right.
So
there
are
6
known
genetic
variants
that
contain
between
0
and
5
phosphoserine
units
right.
So
phosphoserine
units
are
becoming
less
much
much
lower ,
alpha
casein
was
17
s
alpha
s
1
was
17
alpha
s
2
was
between
10
to
13,
and
this
one
less
than
around
5
or
6
around
5
6
numbers
of
your
not
around
5
0
to
5
0
to
5
phosphoserine
units
are
there.
Similar
to
alpha
s
1
casein
beta
casein
has
few
secondary
structures
due
to
the
presence
of
35
proline
residues
right.
So
we
said
that
the
degradation
or
the
proteolysis
of
the
protein
is
primarily
due
to
the
lack
of
the
presence
of
your
secondary
and
tertiary
structures
in
alpha
s
1
casein
and
beta
casein.
So
here
also
we
see
that
it
has
a
little
beta
casein
has
a
little
few
secondary
structures
which
may
help
to
sustain
which
may
help
to
resist
a
little
against
the
proteolysis
right.
So
the
third
one
is
gamma
casein
ok
alpha
s
1,
alpha
s
2,
beta
that
is
alpha
casein
beta
casein
gamma
casein
right.
So
gamma
casein
is
derived
if
we
do
not
take
pen
then
it
will
go
to
the
next
page,
so
alpha
casein
is
derived
by
hydrolysis
of
beta
casein
by
the
enzyme
plasmin
by
the
enzyme
called
plasmin.
So
alpha
casein
is
hydrolised
2
beta
casein
gamma
casein
is
derived
by
hydrolysis
of
beta
casein
by
the
enzyme
called
plasmin.
So
from
beta
casein
gamma
casein
is
produced
and
that
is
by
the
hydrolysis
with
the
help
of
the
enzyme
called
plasmin,
and
3
variants
have
been
identified
near
the
carbon
terminal
and
of
the
beta
casein
molecule
right.
So
there
could
be
3
such
variations
of
the
gamma
casein.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
then
we
kappa
casein
that
is
what
is
remaining
that
kappa
casein
is
what
that
kappa
casein
consists
of
169
amino
acids
and
approximately
around
19
kilo
Dalton,
approximately
around
19
kilo
Dalton
is
the
size
and
it
contains
both
glycosyl
and
phosphoryl
that
is
it
is
glycosylated
and
phosphorylated
residues
it
contains
right.
So
glycosyl
and
phosphoryl
these
2
groups
so
that
means,
it
is
glycosylated
as
well
as
phosphorylated.
So
it
contains
both
the
glycosylated
and
phosphorylated
residues
right.
Now ,
this
is
the
unit
of
the
kappa
casein
it
consists
of
it
consists
of
it
or
it
can
exist
it
can
exist
as
a
dimer
up
to
a
up
to
a
decamer
with
the
subunits
held
together
by
disulfide
linkage
right
disulfide
linkage
the
other
day
we
had
said
that
this
is
like
this
right.
So
we
gave
it
to
be
with
chlorine
and
many
others
this
is
the
simplest
s
2
l,
c
l
2
right,
simplest
disulfide,
which
we
can
think
of
or
which
we
can
give
example.
So
that
disulfide
linkage
is
subunits
held
together
by
the
disulfide
linkage
right.
Then
unlike
the
other
caseins
it
is
not
sensitive
to
calcium
and
surrounds
the
micelles
keeping
them
intact.
So
micelles
we
have
already
said
earlier
now
again
it
may
be
in
the
subsequent
class
we
caseins
now
we
are
again
in
the
milk
protein.
So
in
the
casein
so
casein
micelle
may
be
a
little
we
can
highlight,
but
earlier
we
have
said.
So
unlike
the
other
caseins
it
is
not
sensitive
to
calcium
and
surrounds
the
micelle
keeping
them
intact
it
usually
contains
1
phosphoserine
unit.
However ,
genetic
variants
containing
2
or
3
phosphoserine
units
have
been
identified,
further
9
variants
have
been
identified
that
demonstrate
different
degrees
of
glycosylation
right.
So
we
have
come
across
with
different
causes
why
proteins
are
hydrophobic
in
nature,
which
component
of
the
protein,
alpha,
beta,
gamma
and
kappa
out
of
which
alpha
as
alpha
s
1
and
alpha
s
2,
how
they
are
behaving
what
are
the
reason
how
many
number
of
aminoacids
are
present
all
these
we
have
discussed
right.
So
next
we
may
be
going
to
the
casein
micelle.
Thank
you.
