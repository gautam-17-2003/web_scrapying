Milk
-
Constituents
So,
keep
in
mind
in
the
previous
class
we
said
that
don’ t
consume
that
curdled
milk
if
it
is
curdled
by
nature
right,
by
nature
means
just
keeping
it
for
long
time
outside,
then
don’ t
take
it
ok.
Now
again
in
this
class
of
the
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology ,
we
are
in
the
lecture
19.
So,
what
are
the
constituents
of
milk?
W e
have
seen
how
it
is,
how
it
is
a
looking,
what
are
the
taste,
etcetera,
etcetera.
Now ,
we
will
come
to
the
constituents
of
the
milk
ok,
that
we
will
come
and
we
will
see
that
how
acidification
and
others
ok.
Now
constituents
of
milk
are
like
this,
water
it
contains
around
80
to
90
percent;
80
to
90
percent
water ,
as
we
have
said
in
some
class
that
depending
on
the
source,
depending
on
the
type,
depending
on
the
species,
this
composition
varies
widely .
So,
that
is
why
we
are
saying
80
to
90
percent
roughly;
again
it
it
is
it
is
not
that
any
milk
will
contain
either
80
or
90
percent
depending
on
many
many
factors,
this
varies
between
that
this
is
a
representative
number
right.
Small
amount
of
water
are
also
associated
in
milk
as
hydration.
I
hope
you
have
seen
in
school
chemistry
that
hydrated
right
say
copper
copper
sulfide
hydrated
right.
So
that
means
it
contains
may
be
2H
2
O,
5H
2
O
as
hydration,
so
like
that
hydrated
way
some
amount
or
some
very
small
quantity
of
water
may
be
also
associated
as
hydration
or
they
may
be
bound
chemically
right.
As
may
be
to
the
lactose
or
may
be
to
salt
or
may
be
to
protein
depending
on
case
by
case
right;
so,
that
is
how
some
water
is
also
there.
Generally
the
water
activity
another
term
which
may
be
we
have
said,
but
if
have
not
let
me
also
tell
here
water
activity .
This
is
a
parameter
by
which
we
tell
how
much
water
is
available
for
the
or ganisms
to
grow ,
how
much
water
is
available
for
the
or ganisms
to
grow
by
definition,
we
call
it
to
be
water
activity
as
ratio
of
vapor
pressure
of
water
in
the
food
material
at
a
temperature
to
that
of
the
pure
water
at
that
same
temperature,
this
is
the
definition
of
water
activity
right.
So,
milk
contains
high
water
activity
because
we
have
seen
that
it
is
around
80
90
percent
of
water .
So,
it
is
water
activity
is
almost
0.99563
depending
on
case
by
case,
but
it
is
very
high
more
than
0.9
right
and
if
I
have
said
then
could
be
a
repetition,
but
still
better
to
repeat
that
water
activity
if
it
is
around
0.9
onwards
above
rather
water
activity
varies
between
say
0.1
or
even
say
1
to
1
to
10
rather
0.1
to
1
it
is
upto
1
right
or
0
to
1
we
can
say
though
it
is
not
0
since
0.1
or
even
lower
is
there.
So,
that
depends
on
the
ratio
of
the
vapor
pressure
in
the
water
as
well
as
in
the
pure
water ,
so
at
a
temperature
given
temperature
so
that
ratio
can
be
very
close
to
0.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
between
0
to
1,
1
is
the
maximum
right,
so
if
it
is
0.999
like
that
then
it
is
close
to
1.
So,
anything
beyond
0.9
that
is
good
for
or ganisms
like
bacteria
to
grow .
So,
bacteria
grows
around
0.9
water
activity
and
above,
0.8
water
activity
and
above
is
for
the
yeast,
yeast
to
grow .
if
we
if
we
classify
the
or ganisms
in
3
classes
bacteria
yeast
and
mold,
I
hope
I
have
said
in
earlier
class
bacteria
yeast
and
mold.
And
in
that
case
yeast
is
around
0.8
and
mold
is
around
0.7.
So,
0.7
onwards
mold
can
grow ,
0.8
onwards
yeast
can
grow ,
0.9
onwards
bacteria
can
grow .
Obviously
0.9
not
only
bacteria
bacteria
yeast
mold
all
3
can
grow ,
but
if
it
is
0.8
bacteria
cannot
grow ,
yeast
mold
both
can
grow;
if
it
is
0.7,
then
yeast
cannot
or
bacteria
cannot
grow
only
mold
can
grow .
So,
if
it
is
less
then
0.7
then
bacteria
I
am
from
the
microbiologic
point
of
view
or
typically
it
is
0.6
because,
there
are
some
which
are
evens
even
can
tolerate
at
this
low
water
activity
of
0.7.
So,
0.6
or
below
is
good
enough
for
the
elimination
of
the
bacteria
or
or ganisms,
so
in
that
case
the
milk
has
very
high
water
activity ,
that
means
it
is
very
much
susceptible.So,
I
just
said
you
in
the
last
class
that
don’ t
take
milk
if
it
is
curdled
just
like
that
because,
it
is
having
so
much
high
water
activity
that
not
only
that
curdling
or ganism,
but
also
many
other
which
may
for
undesirable
end
product
may
also
develop
and
which
may
be
very
bad
if
it
is
consumed.
Say
again
and
again
there
is
there
is
very
very
high
chance
of
getting
the
infected
by
consuming
them
or
by
because
of
the
end
product
which
is
not
desirable
right.
So,
this
is
why
those
or ganisms
make
grow
in
and
that
may
be
some
is
some
may
be
some
mold,
that
may
be
some
bacteria
may
do
something
and
you
will
not
be
coming
to
know
what
is
the
product
which
has
been
developed
by
the
or ganism
right.
So,
removal
of
water
as
usual
increases
the
shelf
life
by
and
lar ge
we
earlier
also
we
have
said
by
removal
of
water
is
one
of
the
technique
by
which
we
extend
the
storage
life
of
the
food
material,
in
milk
also
it
is
like
that
milk
powder
example.
Milk
powder
for
example,
is
also
an
a
highly
water
I
mean
highly
stable
product,
where
the
water
content
is
very
very
low
right;
raw
milk
should
not
be
diluted
with
addition
of
water
by
rule.
So,
it
is
that
in
many
cases
we
have
seen
that
the
milk
man
the
they
if
by
chance
a
milk
is
a
spilled
over
or
if
the
demand
is
high,
then
those
milkman
they
do
add
this
water
externally
and
by
law
this
is
adulteration
and
you
have
should
not
you
cannot.
So,
if
you
come
across
protest
or
don’ t
allow
to
do
that,
this
is
by
rule
by
law
it
cannot
be
added
just
like
that,
so
water
is
one
of
the
major
constituent
of
milk.
Then
fat
commonly
known
as
butter
fat,
this
fat
is
commonly
known
as
butter
fat
and
this
fat
varies
in
milk
may
be
around
say
2.5
to
6
that
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
earlier
classes,
that
it
varies
very
widely
depending
on
the
source
depending
on
the
species
place
for
all
the
purposes
it
is
like
there.
Why
I
remember
when
we
had
given,
so
I
also
said
that
people
who
are
at
the
high
altitude.
Y es
some
animals
are
there
and
their
fat
content
is
so,
high
that
the
consuming
those
milk
the
young
gets
lot
of
ener gy
to
fight
against
the
nature
of
cold
right.
So,
that
is
for
high
fat
where
and
where
this
temperature
is
very
high,
there
that
fat
content
will
be
very
low
because,
again
that
digestion
for
these
young
will
be
easier
if
the
fat
content
is
also
low
in
that
area
right.
So,
this
is
what;
then
protected
by
a
membrane
and
called
Fat
Globule
Membrane
or
FGM
right
protected
by
a
membrane
called
Fat
Globule
Membrane
or
FGM.
This
membrane
is
generally
made
of
approximately
98
percent
triglycerides
0.2
percent
to
1
percent
phospholipids,
and
0.2
to
0.4
percent
sterols
right.
Generally
not
the
membrane
this
fat
is
that
is
milk
fat
is
made
of
around
98
percent
triglyceride
0.2
to
1
percent
phospholipids
and
0.2
to
0.4
percent
sterols
dif ferent
kind
of
sterols
are
there
right,
cholesterol
is
what
such
which
we
come
across
right.
Dif ferent
types
of
sterols
are
also
there.
This
phospholipids
and
proteins
are
mostly
associated
in
the
FGM
that
is
Fat
Globule
Membrane
right.
Fat
globule
membrane
contains
lot
of
protein
some
phospholipids
and
this
is
how
when
we
come
across
with
the
fat
globule,
that
time
you
will
see
that
this
membrane
which
is
around
say
plus
minus
10
nanometer
in
size
thick
rather
plus
minus
this
membrane
is
around
10
nanometer
in
thick.
And
that
contains
some
proteins
some
phospholipids,
some
others
some
enzymes
etcetera
are
also
there
right.
So,
that
when
we
come
across
with
the
globule
fat
globule
that
time
you
will
tell
in
more
a
in
detail.
So,
this
fat
or
milk
fat
is
termed
generally
if
it
is
table
or
light
or
cof fee
or
single
cream
then
the
fat
contain
is
around
18
to
25
percent.
If
it
is
light
whipping
that
is
not
less
than
around
30
percent,
if
it
is
heavy
whipping
then
it
could
be
around
36
percent
or
if
it
is
plastic
or
extra
heavy
cream
then
it
is
around
65
to
80
percent.
By
the
by
though
the
milk
is
normally
known
as
butter
fat,
butter
also
do
have
high
concentration
of
fat
high
percentage
of
fat,
it’ s
around
82
to
83
percent
of
fat
right
milk
fat
right
that
is
why
this
fat
or
milk
fat
is
also
known
as
butter
fat
right
yeah.Butter
contains
around
82.5
percent
roughly
82
to
83
percent,
butter
oil
which
is
a
dry
butter
is
around
98
to
99.5
percent
fat
98
to
99
percent
as
minimum
water
as
possible
there,
this
is
very
very
98
to
98
point
depending
on
the
purity
is
a
fat
is
there
that
is
the
butter
oil.
By
the
by
the
by
definition
oil
and
fat
they
may
be
the
same,
but
normally
from
the
chemistry
point
of
view
we
call
if
fat
is
solid
at
room
temperature,
then
that
is
called
fat
or
if
it
is
liquid
at
room
temperature
then
that
is
called
oil.
So,
the
dif ference
between
fat
and
oil
is
that,
if
state
physical
state
that
is
whether
it
is
solid
at
room
temperature
or
liquid
at
room
temperature,
depending
on
that
it
is
call
fat
or
oil.
So,
that’ s
why
butter
is
solid,
but
butter
oil
is
liquid
right,
though
the
fat
content
for
both
are
very
very
high
right.
So,
this
is
by
the
by
we
are
say
by
the
not
by
the
by
as
an
accessory
we
are
saying
right,
that
the
dif ference
between
butter
and
fat
is
that
I
sorry
fat
and
oil
is
that,
fat
is
solid
at
room
temperature
and
butter
is
liquid
at
room
temperature.
So,
there
are
many
other
formulation
percentages
of
fat
present
in
many
other
milk
products.
For
example,
if
we
look
at
cheddar
cheese
another
a
variety
of
cheese
that
contains
around
30
to
40
percent
fat,
milk
fat
cheddar
cheese
contains.
Ice
cream
it
also
contains
around
8
to
20
percent
depending
on
the
ice
cream
it
varies
so,
widely
it
fat
content
is
8
to
20
percent.
Evaporated
milk
it
contains
also
fat
around
8
percent
or
whole
milk
whole
milk
normally
it
contains
very
high
percentage
of
fat
and
whole
milk
normally
we
call
it
to
be
dry .
Now ,
when
it
is
dried,
then
it
becomes
based
on
dry
basis
hopefully ,
we
also
can
dif ferentiate
between
wet
basis
and
dry
basis
right.
So,
whole
milk
generally
powder
so
it
is
said
in
terms
of
dry
basis
and
that
is
why
the
percentage
of
fat
is
so
high
though
in
the
whole
or
in
the
wet
it
may
be
much
lower .
And
it
exists
in
milk
in
the
form
of
minute
globules,
very
very
small
globules
are
there
fat
globules,
generally
the
globule
diameter
varies
may
be
from
decimal
to
up
to
25,
30
micron
in
size.
The
fat
globule
obviously
the
moment
we
are
saying
globule
that
means,
it
is
spherically
in
shape
that
is
in
spherical
globule
means
spherical
in
shape
right.
So,
it
will
have
diameter
so
the
diameter
is
may
be
less
then
1
to
around
30,
25,
30
micron
in
size
right
in
varies
widely
right;
obviously ,
the
bigger
the
size;
less
is
the
number
and
the
smaller
is
the
size
more
is
the
number
in
globules.
And
subsequently
we
will
see
in
1
drop
it
contains
around
10
to
the
power
8
number
of
fat
globules,
in
1
drop
of
milk
contains
around
10
to
the
power
8
number
of
fat
globules
right.
So,
you
imagine
and
that’ s
why
I
said
that
the
bigger
the
size,
small
is
the
number
of
fat
globules,
the
smaller
is
the
size
more
is
the
number
of
fat
globules
in
terms
of
numbers
right.
So,
in
a
true
emulsion
of
oil
in
water ,
in
the
dispersed
phase.
In
milk
fat
typically
in
milk
this
fat
is
present
as
a
typically
emulsion
where
it
is
fat
in
or
oil
in
water
that
there
it
is
not
said
fat;
it
is
said
oil
in
water
o
w
that
emulsion
is
where
oil
is
in
the
dispersed
phase
and
water
is
in
the
continuous
phase.
Because
the
fat
content
is
very
low
may
be
around
5
6
7
percent,
whereas
water
content
is
around
80
90
percent.
So,
that
is
more
in
quantity;
so,
it
is
in
continues
phase
and
the
other
1
is
in
the
in
the
dispersed
phase,
that
is
fat
is
in
the
dispersed
phase.
And
the
emulsion
is
called
oil
in
water
oil
is
in
the
dispersed
phase
and
water
is
in
continuous
phase.
The
reverse
if
it
is
butter
where
the
fat
content
is
around
80
to
plus
percentage
say
around
82
percentage,
there
it
is
water
is
around
say
17
15
to
17
percent
or
17
plus
minus
percentage
above
water
is
there,
so
water
is
much
low
compared
to
that
of
fat.
So,
there
it
is
call
the
emulsion
is
call
water
in
oil
that
is
water
is
in
the
dispersed
phase
and
oil
is
in
the
continuous
phase,
so
there
it
is
the
emulsion
of
water
in
oil
right.
Each
globule
of
fat
is
surrounded
by
a
very
thin
film
of
protein
or
the
serum
of
milk
concentrated
on
the
surface
and
held
in
place
by
surface
attraction
or
adsorption.
As
you
said
that
this
fat
globule
or
membrane
fat
globule
do
have
a
membrane
and
this
membrane
is
generally
around
10
nanometer
thick
which
we
have
said.
The
concentrated
layer
surrounding
by
the
fat
globule
is
composed
of
certain
protein
and
fat
like
substances
especially
lecithin
right.In
this
case,
fat
is
not
soluble
in
water
right
and
this
fat
and
water
the
relationship
which
normally
jokingly
say
that
the
relation
between
saas
and
bahu
right;
though
I
am
not
saying
bad
or
anything,
but
generally
the
relation
is
like
that
that
none
of
them
can
tolerate
each
other .
So,
here
also
that
fat
and
water
or
oil
and
water
they
cannot
tolerate
each
other
right
that
is
why
you
cannot
mix
oil
with
water .
So,
one
very
good
thing
that
people
cannot
in
a
cannot
adulterate
oil
with
water
if
oil
would
have
been
mixable
with
water
then
we
don’ t
know
where
we
would
have
landed
up
right.
So,
like
milk
water
could
have
been
freely
added
to
it.
But
it
is
not
so
right
because
oil
is
not
mixable
with
water .
So,
what
happens
how
they
are
then
together?
Because,
if
they
are
not
possible
if
they
are
not
possible
to
stay
together
then
how
they
are.
So,
this
fellow
what
we
just
said
lecithin
right
especially
lecithin
that
we
said
at
the
end,
this
lecithin
is
one
mediator ,
this
is
one
mediator
between
fat
and
oil
rather
fat
and
water
or
oil
and
water
right
lecithin
is
a
acting
as
a
mediator
where
it
has
1
hydrophobic
and
1
hydrophilic
end.
So,
one
end
which
is
hydrophilic
that
is
water
loving
and
another
end
which
is
hydrophobic
that
is
water
repelling
end.
So,
this
water
repelling
and
water
loving
ends
together
is
the
lecithin.
So,
the
hydrophilic
end
goes
towards
the
polar
end
that
is
the
water
and
the
hydrophobic
end
that
is
which
is
going
to
the
oil
end
or
fat
end.
So,
the
hydrophobic
end
couples
with
the
fat
end
and
the
hydrophilic
end
couples
with
the
water
end
by
that
way
water
and
oil
are
together
on
the
same
milk
right;
on
the
same
milk
both
oil
and
water
are
together ,
because
of
the
presence
of
lecithin
which
acts
as
the
mediator
right.So,
milk
fat
contains
traces
of
fatty
acids.
It
contains
traces
of
fatty
acids
vitamins
A
D
E
and
K
and
lot
many
enzymes,
this
milk
fat
contains
traces
of
fatty
acids
then
comes
what
is
fatty
acid?
Fatty
acids
are
those
which
can
add
to
glycerol
forming
glyceride
or
triglycerides.
So,
normally
by
an
theoretically
it
is
H
COOH
that
is
the
formic
acid
it
is
also
having
a
carboxylic
acid.
So,
any
carboxylic
acid
if
it
is
forming
with
the
glyceride
with
the
glycerol,
then
that
could
be
called
a
fatty
acid
but
formic
acid
does
is
one
which
is
not
like
that
or
the
second
one
right,
that
is
H
COOH
or
C
H
3
C
OOH
that
is
1
membered
2
membered
generally
3
membered
or
4
membered
onwards
4
membered
onwards
we
are
we
call
it
to
be
fatty
acid,
4
membered
onwards
it
call
it
to
be
long
chain
fatty
acid
or
short
chain
fatty
acid.
The
more
the
number
of
carbon
more
is
the
long
chain
and
the
less
the
number
of
carbon
less
is
the
short
chain
or
it
is
called
short
chain
right.
Generally
it
is
myristic
acid
C
14,
0
means
there
is
no
double
bond,
palmitic
acid
C
16
no
double
bonds,
stearic
acids
C
18
no
double
bond,
oleic
acid
C
18
with
1
double
bond
right
more
then,
so
400
dif ferent
fatty
acids
are
there
and
and
out
of
which
the
predominants
are
myristic
palmitic
stearic
oleic
all
these
are
right
they
are
predominant.
But
lower
number
fatty
acids
are
also
they
are
let
us
C
4,
C
6,
C
8,
C
10,
C
12
they
are
also
present.
And
we
will
see
subsequently
in
future
class
that
this
lower
number
they
are
volatile
fatty
acids,
whereas
the
higher
numbers
they
are
non
volatile
right.
So,
the
volatility
also
depends
on
the
number
of
carbon
atoms
presenting
in
the
chain,
if
it
is
short
chain
then
normally
they
are
volatile,
if
it
is
long
chain
normally
they
are
non
volatile
right.
When
we
go
into
detail
then
we
will
also
come
across
of
course,
as
I
said
as
and
when
we
are
coming
across
normally
I
try
I
am
trying
to
explain
so
that
the
understanding
becomes
much
better .
Lipids
proteins
cerebrosides
rather
cerebrosides
nucleic
acids
enzymes
trace
elements
like
minerals
and
some
bound
water
stabilize
and
prevent
fat
globules
from
coalescence
during
milk
processing
and
handling.
By
the
by
since
the
word
has
come
lipid,
here
also
we
much
know
that
there
is
a
dif ference
between
lipid
and
fat.
In
general
or
not
in
general
it
is
that
all
fats
are
lipids
they
are
on
the
lipid
umbrella,
but
not
all
lipids
are
fats.
Because
there
are
many
lipids
which
have
non
fat
right,
where
the
lipoprotein
or
glycoprotein
these
are
many
there
which
are
not
fat,
but
they
are
lipid
right
like
lecithin
right
phospholipids.
So,
this
is
there
this
is
not
fat;
fats
are
only
the
triglycerides
or
diglycerides
or
mono
glyceride
or
glycerides
of
fatty
acids
with
glycerol.
Gycerides
of
fatty
acids
or
glycerides
or
esters
of
fatty
acids
with
glycerol.
Glycerol
is
the
basic
that
is
C
H
2
O
H;
C
H
O
H;
C
H
2
O
H.
So,
this
which
is
adding
with
acid
and
we
know
acid
alcohol
they
put
a
together
from
the
ester
and
this
is
called
as
esterification.
So,
this
esterification
if
it
is
single
then
called
mono
if
it
is
double
then
call
di
or
if
it
is
all
3
then
call
triglyceride,
generally
major
portion
of
the
glycerides
in
milk
fat
is
triglyceride;
we
are
running
short
of
time
now .
Thank
you.
