Preservation
Techniques
In
our
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Product
Technology
course,
now
we
shall
move
to
what
are
the
different
preservation
techniques,
normally
followed
in
both
Liquid
and
Solid
food.
In
the
earlier
classes,
we
are
also
said
that
this
food
is
a
vast
course;
its
width
and
depth
are
so
high
that
just
not
possible
to
cover
everything
in
one
class
or
in
one
subject.
However ,
we
also
said
that
we
will
as
and
when
we
will
come
up
with
new
and
new
terms
and
new
and
new
concepts
or
ideas
that
time
we
will
try
to
explain
in
as
much
possible
and
then,
proceed
accordingly
right.
So,
that
is
why
when
we
are
saying
this
we
will
be
coming
to
this
Preservation
Techniques
right.
So,
what
are
the
Preservation
Techniques
which
are
applied?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:27)
This
is
by
Application
of
Heat,
removal
of
heat,
but
generally
we
are
applying
cold
right.
So,
removal
of
heat
or
by
dehydration
or
by
Physical
methods
other
than
thermal,
Biological
1
methods
including
in
including
some
controls;
then,
Fermentation;
then,
chemical
preservation,
Irradiation
and
Emer ging
technologies.
So,
this
is
encompassing
the
big
umbrella
of
a
what
are
the
different
techniques
by
which
you
can
preserve
your
food
material
for
a
longer
period.
Obviously ,
the
processes
involved
in
it
will
be
not
identical
or
similar;
it
will
be
also
quite
different
a
lot
right.
Now ,
when
we
are
talking
about
the
application
of
heat,
this
we
are
definitely
associated
with
our
everyday
life.
So,
whenever
nowadays
I
am
not
going
back
to
very
primitive
only
this;
whenever
we
are
applying
heat
particularly
when
we
are
making
food
products
at
home.
So,
what
do
you
do?
We
apply
in
almost
90
to
95
%
cases,
we
apply
heat
right
and
so
thereby ,
we
cook
or
fry
or
boil
or
simply
heat
for
some
reasons
right
and
these
all
we
do
prior
to
consumption
of
the
food
material
right.
So,
application
of
heat
we
come
across
every
almost
now
and
then
at
our
household
processing
or
house
hold
whenever
you
dealing
with
food.
So,
prior
to
consumption,
if
these
heat
are
applied;
then,
that
is
for
cooking
at
home,
but
for
commercial
processes
there
are
some
more
things
which
are
associated
like
what
we
call
blanching,
pasteurization,
sterilization
or
dehydration
all
this
processes
are
commercial
process
right.
So,
these
processes
we
will
come
across
and
we
will
try
to
explain
and
understand
what
they
are
right.
So,
if
we
see
in
that
the
first
thing
which
commercially
we
used
is
Blanching.
So,
Blanching
is
done
between
75
to
95°C
;
for
a
time
period
of
1
to
10
minute.
So,
between
1
to
10
minute,
we
heat
the
product
again
depending
on
the
type
of
product
between
depending
on
the
size
of
product
all
will
also
where
from
it
is
and
what
is
the
initial
condition
of
the
of
the
microbial
population.
All
these
will
dictate
what
is
the
time
and
keep
in
mind
there
is
no
absolute
term
or
absolute
word
that
only
temperature
or
only
time,
it
is
always
a
time
and
temperature
combination.
It
is
always
a
time
as
well
temperature
right.
So,
if
it
is
time
only
specified,
it
will
not
be
encompassing
the
situation
or
if
it
is
only
temperature
specified,
it
will
also
not
tell
the
condition.
It
is
both
time
and
temperature
together ,
that
will
indicate
that
what
you
are
doing,
what
is
the
benefit
or
what
is
the
loss?
All
aspects
will
come
accordingly .
2So,
generally
this
is
the
general
term
that
generally
blanching
is
done
by
heating
around
75
to
90
°C
for
around
1
to
or
95
°C
for
hour
around
1
to
10
minutes
that
again
depends
on.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:27)
Now ,
where
we
use
blanching?
Generally ,
we
use
blanching
prior
to
drying,
canning,
freezing
or
to
delay
reaching
the
enzyme
in
a
or
to
delay
the
enzyme
activities.
So,
that
enzymes
can
be
kept
aside.
So,
all
these
will
be
using
blanching,
but
keep
in
mind,
since
processes
like
drying
or
canning
you
are
you
are
doing
blaching,
you
are
doing
heating
drying
is
done
by
heating;
canning
is
also
by
heating
at
high
temperature
or
depending
on
again
process
product
all
together .
But,
there
you
are
you
are
you
are
giving
heat
in
general,
but
look
at
the
other;
there
is
the
freezing.
There
you
are
lowering
down
the
temperature;
there
is
no
application
of
heat
in
the
freezing.
So,
prior
to
freezing
if
blanching
is
done,
then
that
is
more
advantages
in
that
compared
to
the
other
two;
in
other
two
already
of
course,
I
am
not
saying
that
they
are
not
required
for
drying
or
canning.
They
are
obviously
required,
but
more
requirement
is
more
in
case
of
freezing
than
that
for
the
drying
or
canning
or
similar
kind
of
heat
when
you
are
applying.
So,
freezing
we
should
be
always
associated
with
blanching
right.
Now ,
why
should
we
blanch
that
thing
comes
into
mind
that
yes,
we
are
saying
that
in
drying
when
we
are
heating
3
as
such
or
in
canning
when
we
are
heating
as
such;
then,
why
should
we
under go
this
blanching
process.
We
have
said
that
blanching
is
nothing
but
when
your
subjecting
the
product
to
be
blanched.
This
product
is
the
process
is
called
Blanching
and
the
product
which
call
which
we
received
is
called
blanched
product
right.
So,
there
when
you
are
blanching,
it
rise
temperature
70
to
95
°C
and
for
a
time
period
of
1
to
10
minute.
Again,
I
am
repeating
that
this
is
depending
on
product
from
where
you
are
taking
size,
shape,
initial
condition
of
the
product
whether
you
have
sub
lot
of
microbes
available
in
that
source
from
where
it
is
coming.
So,
all
these
will
dictate
what
should
be
the
time
and
temperature
combination
right.
So,
what
it
does?
It
does
the
or
restricts
the
undesirable
changes
in
terms
of
odour ,
flavor ,
color ,
texture
and
also
nutritive
value
during
storage
and
this
is
mainly
associated
with
the
freezing
term.
It
removes
intracellular
gases.
Minimizes
potential
for
oxidative
it
minimizes
potential
for
oxidative
changes
and.
So,
it
minimizes
oxidative
changes,
reduces
microbial
load
or
leaches
out
if
there
be
any
toxic
constituents
such
as
nitrates.
So,
this
is
this
is
a
compound
which
is
very
detrimental
that
methaemoglobinemia.
So,
this
is
a
very
toxic
in
the
stage
of
infants,
where
supply
of
oxygen
to
the
tissues
are
getting
affected
right
and
it
also
removes
pesticides
if
they
are
associated
right.
So,
by
blanching
we
are
protecting
flavour ,
colour ,
odour
and
nutritive
value
and
also
we
are
escaping
we
are
we
are
removing
some
dissolved
gases,
some
toxic
materials
and
also
maybe
some
pesticides.
So,
all
these
will
be
associated
with
the
term
blanching
right.
4(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:55)
So,
what
why
then
we
use?
We
use
to
increase
the
stability
of
chlorophyll,
sodium
carbonate
and
calcium
oxide
also
can
be
added
during
3
minute
blanching
at
90
°C.
In
many
cases
chlorophyll,
what?
The
color
of
chlorophyll
is
green;
So,
those
for
green
material,
green
food
material.
If
the
original
is
green;
obviously ,
you
would
like
to
have
more
green
or
close
to
the
greenness
as
it
is
available
in
the
normal
or
natural
fruit
food.
So,
while
processing
or
while
making
some
products,
if
your
green
color
is
maintained;
then
obviously ,
the
attraction
or
the
commercial
application
will
be
more
beneficial.
So,
this
will
help
you
to
minimum
to
keep
the
green
color
of
the
material
right
and
then,
in
that
sodium
carbonate
or
calcium
oxide
all
may
be
added
as
supplement.
So,
that
the
color
retention
is
very
easy
right.
So,
then
we
can
we
do
it
for
to
prevent
the
discolouration,
we
add
sodium
pyrophosphate
right
and
this
is
mainly
done
for
the
case
of
potato,
cauliflower
those
who
are
susceptible
for
the
temperature
also.
Subsequently ,
we
will
come
to
something
or
since
it
has
come
let
me
also
tell
here
that
you
have
seen
that
potato
at
home,
when
it
is
cut
it
gets
brown
right.
Like
apple,
it
gets
brown
when
the
movement
it
is
cut
and
you
are
not
taking
care
of
that
and
it
starts
getting
brown
5
right.
There
is
a
reason
for
that
we
may
come
subsequently
because
since
it
has
come
here,
let
me
tell
that
these
browning
is
known
as
enzymatic
browning
right.
The
enzymes
present
in
potato
or
apple
they
convert
this
color
to
brown
and
unnecessarily
those
extra
colors
which
are
not
acceptable
by
the
consumer
is
coming
in.
So,
you
do
not
want
that.
To
prevent
that
this
blanching
helps
you
a
lot
that
this
enzyme
can
be
inactivated
and
to
do
that
you
are
also
adding
some
chemicals
like
sodium
pyrophosphate
that
can
be
also
added
so
that
the
color
is
not
getting
brown.
So,
how
then
we
can
achieve
the
purpose,
we
have
said
that
why
should
we?
Now ,
next
come
why
how
should
we?
We
came
to
first,
what
shall
we;
then,
we
came
to
know
why
should
we
and
now,
how
should
we
perform
this
blanching
process
right.
So,
method
is
to
achieve
this
normally
either
hot
water
or
steam
or
micro
wave
these
can
be
used
or
maybe
some
electrical
conductions
that
can
be
used
right.
So,
majority
in
cases
in
commercial
scale,
it
is
steam
because
that
is
more
easy
and
economy
also
compared
to
any
other
mode
of
heating.
But
again,
as
in
the
some
previous
classes
we
said
the
same
shirt
cannot
be
given
to
everybody
because
it
also
depends
on
your
size
your
shape
your
appearance
everything.
Here
also
some
factors
will
come
that
will
dictate
whether
that
same
thing
can
be
used
that
whether
steam
can
be
used
everywhere
or
water
can
be
used
some
places
or
maybe
microwave
or
maybe
some
other
methods
right
may
be
heat
conduction
in
many
cases,
it
is
also
being
used.
But
in
majority
it
is
the
milk;
it
is
the
it
is
the
steam
which
is
being
used
for
blanching
or
heating
right
and
every
dark
there
is
also
a
bright
or
every
light
there
is
a
dark.
So,
any
good
thing
also
it
is
associated
with
bad.
See
if
you
only
talk
about
good;
then,
you
do
not
know
what
is
the
bad
part
of
it.
So,
bad
part
of
it
is
the
blanching
disadvantage
that
we
can
call
the
disadvantages
of
blanching
is
that
since
again,
it
is
a
time
and
temperature.
This
you
can
appreciate
afterwards
when
we
come
to
another
parameter
called
temperature
coefficient.
We
will
define
perhaps
we
have
given
some
introduction.
We
will
come
more
in
detail
there
and
that
temperature
coefficient
will
tell
you
or
make
you
more
understand
that
why
there
will
be
disadvantages.
Since,
we
are
heating
it
75
to
95;
70
to
95°C
.
So,
within
this
range
of
temperature
to
at
time
of
around
1
to
10
minute.
6So,
depending
on
this
time
temperature
combination,
there
may
be
some
losses
of
the
nutrients,
some
discoloration
or
extra
coloration
color
fading
all
these
problems
may
be
associated.
So,
generally
around
30
to
40
percent
vitamins
and
around
20%
protein
are
destroyed.
So,
this
loss
we
go
that
generally
we
lose
around
30
to
40
%
this
is
not
minus.
30
to
40
%
vitamins
and
minerals
we
lose
and
around
20
%
proteins
we
will
loss.
So,
20
%
generally
at
the
most
a
good
source
of
protein
food
containing
protein;
we
will
have
at
the
most
around
15-20
%
protein.
So,
out
of
that
20
%
one-fifth
is
if
it
is
lost,
that
is
definitely
a
good
loss
right.
So,
this
is
one
of
some
of
the
disadvantages
which
are
associated
with
blanching.
This
is
commonly
also
measured
by
the
nutrient

say
the
change
in
ascorbic
acid
this
is
a
parameter
by
which
we
can
tell
that
change
in
ascorbic
acid
will
dictate
how
good
or
how
bad
the
blanching
was.
How
much
we
lost
the
nutrient
that
can
be
right.
So,
we
have
removed
this
and
let
us
go
to
the
next
page.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:17)
So,
this
then
we
have
come
some
of
the
disadvantages.
Obviously ,
by
I
mean
case
to
case
advantage
or
disadvantage
will
vary
and
if
when
you
are
considering
one
trip
typical
case;
then
you
can
mode
in
detail
not
this
is
in
general
mode
in
details
this
can
you
can
you
can
find
out
or
you
can
establish
that
whether
advantages
or
disadvantages.
7
Obviously ,
you
will
not
go
where
everything
is
or
advantage
is
less;
disadvantage
is
more.
Obviously ,
you
will
go
for
where
advantages
are
very
high
compared
to
that
of
the
disadvantage
otherwise
without
doing
that
would
have
been
good
enough.
So,
why
should
unnecessarily
you
incorporate
some
more
things
which
will
destroyed
or
deteriorate
the
quality
or
the
product
available
product
acceptability
right.
So,
in
that
case
disadvantage
is
there,
we
have
we
have
comes
we
have
come
across
and
now
how
to
measure
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
or
it
has
been
achieved;
there
is
advantage
disadvantage
we
have
already
said.
But,
how
to
how
to
measure
that
whether
we
have
achieved
or
suppose
we
have
for
a
typical
case,
we
have
seen
that
this
if
we
do
blanching
it
will
be
good
for
the
product
right.
Now
whether
the
blanching
was
accomplished
or
not
how
to
know;
obviously ,
that
will
depend
on
that
is
measured
by
the
term
called
Efficiency
right.
This
Efficiency
is
measured
with
the
help
of
two
parameters
called
peroxidase
activity
right.
So,
peroxidase
activity
is
one
measure
by
which
we
can
say
whether
our
blanching
was
sufficient
or
not
whether
you
have
correctly
performed
blanching
and
achievement
was
made
or
not
that
can
be
measured
by
determining
the
peroxidase
activity
right.
Now ,
in
blanching
if
that
peroxidase
activity
is
one,
some
other
this
is
a
blanching
where
time
and
temperature
combination
we
have
given
and
said,
but
another
application
of
heat
can
be
for
Pasteurization.
Now ,
nowadays
whatever
milk
we
get
commercially
right
nowadays
those
milk
man
business
is
reduced
drastically
and
mostly
we
get
it
from
the
some
co-operative
systems
like
may
be
Amul
or
may
be
from
this
milk
what
we
get
from
Mother
Dairy
right.
So,
this
kind
of
cooperatives
units
they
are
making
the
unit
very
very
successful,
collecting
from
different
parts.
So,
milk
man
business
has
come
down
drastically .
So,
there
Pasteurization
is
used.
Now ,
this
word
perhaps
the
other
day
I
also
said
that
this
word
Pasteurization
has
come
up
from
the
renowned
scientist
Louis
Pasteur .
From
there
we
this
has
been
established,
this
has
been
implemented
commercially
to
destroy
the
pathogenic
organism
present
in
milk.
8So,
in
that
Pasteurization
there
are
many
ways
of
doing
pasteurization
like
either
hot
water
or
steam
or
dry
heat
or
electrical
currents,
all
can
be
used
and
this
can
be
coupled
with
the
cooling
promptly
right.
So,
by
definition
we
can
call
low
temperature
long
time
that
is
at
lower
temperature,
I
said
that
we
will
come
to
another
parameter
called
temperature
quotient
after
sometime
may
be
some
class.
So,
there
in
detail,
there
you
will
see
that
the
higher
the
temperature
higher
is
the
rates
of
reaction.
So,
to
minimize
there
here
LTLT
that
is
Low
temperature
long
time
pasteurization
is
used
and
this
low
temperature
long
time
come
time
temperature
combination
used
is
63
°C
for
30
min
right;
60°C
,
63
°C
e
for
30
min.
Another
that
is
called
High
temperature
short
time
or
HTST .
This
HTST
is
72
°C
for
15
sec
right
and
all
are
cooled
to
10°C
immediately .
So,
we
have
one-two
types
of
pasteurization
one
LTLT
that
is
Lower
temperature
long
time
and
another
HTST
or
High
temperature
short
time.
But
keep
in
mind,
keep
in
mind
this
time
temperature
combination
is
there
that
is
whether
you
are
heating
at
63
°C
time
is
the
30
min;
whereas,
72°C
time
is
only
15
sec
right.
There
is
some
other
that
is
called
Ultra
high
temperature.
(Refer

Time:

So,
I
think
we
have
shifted
ok.
So,
in
at
least
one
instant
blanching
prior
to
canning
is
used
to
activate
an
enzyme.
With
some
green
beans,
with
some
green
beans,
the
epidermis
is
loosened
upon
heating
and
their
results
in
a
quality
defect
known
as
‘sloughing’
right.
So,
a
moderate
heat
treatment;
a
moderate
heat
treatment
which
is
less
than
61°C
followed
by
a
holding
period
prior
to
thermal
processing,
this
can
prevent
sloughing
through
heat
inactivation
of
an
enzyme
and
this
helps
pectin
methylesterase,
which
demathy
demethylates;
the
pectin
molecule
allowing
crosslinking
with
calcium
ions;
And
this
cross
linking
bonds,
the
outer
layer
of
the
tissue
underlying
structure
preventing
the
sloughing.
So,
normally
earlier
we
have
said
that
blanching
inactivates
enzymes
right
and
we
also
give
some
example
like
cut
piece
of
potato
or
cut
piece
of
apple
when
we
are
doing
that.
So,
their
balancing
helps
that
inactivation
of
this
is
possible,
but
in
some
cases
activation
is
also
done.
For
example,
this
where
sloughing
is
appearing
and
the
tissues
are
been
preserved
by
the
structural
tissues
are
preserved
so
that
sloughing
is
not
there
right.
So,
this
helps
a
lot
when
we
are.
So,
accordingly
as
and
when
you
require
blanching
may
be
helpful
in
destroying
enzymes,
blanching
may
be
helpful
in
retaining
the
enzyme
right.
So,
again
the
time
and
temperature
combination
that
this
is
in
a
typical
case
where
we
are
doing
for
the
betterment
of
the
product
we
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

10
So,
if
you
look
at
the
other
thing
that
that
these
two
enzymes
at
this,
peroxidase
and
catalase,
this
can
be
used
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
blanching
treatment
if
both
are
in
activated;
then,
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
other
significant
enzymes
also
are
inactivated
right.
The
heating
time
necessary
to
destroy
catalase
or
peroxidase
that
depends
on
the
type
and
size
of
the
fruit
material,
fruit
or
vegetables
or
food,
method
of
heating
and
the
temperature
of
the
heating
medium.
Although
blanching
of
vegetables
is
in
most
is
often
is
a
often
done
in
hot
water
or
steam.
So,
blanching
of
fruit
is
often
done
in
calcium
brine.
There
calcium
helps
in
forming
the
fruit
right
through
the
formation
of
some
say
pectates
rather
than
through
the
formation
of
some
pectates
these
are
formed
that
calcium
forms
the
material
right,
in
that
case
it
helps
in
ok.
So
this,
here
stop
for
this
class
because
our
time
is
over.
So,
next
class
we
will
proceed
further .
