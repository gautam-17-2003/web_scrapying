Whey
Protein
In
this
class
we
shall
deal
with
Whey
Protein.
But
if
you
remember
in
our
previous
class
when
we
were
covering
amino
acids,
that
time
we
said
that
there
are
20
amino
acids
and
2
are;
20
amino
acids
which
are
having
coding
universal
coding
system,
they
have
given
code.
And
that
they
I
could
not
show
you,
but
today
of
course
I
shall
show
you
and
that
should
be
in
the
beginning
that
we
go
to
that
list
of
amino
acids
and
their
coding
names.
I
had
shown
you
earlier
different
amino
acids
structures,
but
their
short
name
or
what
we
call
the
short
not
only
short
name
that
is
called
also
your
when
we
are
making
abbreviation.
So,
this
abbreviated
names
also
there
and
in
that
we
can
see
that
there
are
20
amino
acids
which
are
listed
right
and
these
have
the
abbreviated
name
and
the
code
right;
this
I
N
O
R
together .
So,
I
think
we
should
do
the
correction
because
it
is
not
fair
that
this
should
be
there.
This
is
one
and
we
come
to
that.
Yeah
so
that
there
was
in
this
mistake
C
O
I
or
C
I
O
D
E
that
was
a
mistake
typing
and
because
O
and
I
these
two
keys
are
side
by
side.
So,
we
will
see
that
alanine
has
abbreviated
or
short
name
Ala
has
a
code
A,
then
cysteine
with
an
abbreviation
of
Cyc,
that
is
with
a
capital
C
code,
then
aspartic
acid
which
is
Asp
right
with
the
code
D,
then
glutamic
acid
this
is
Glu
missing
glutamic
acid
and
this
is
also
u
is
missing
it
is
not
cut
and
paste,
but
I
do
not
know
why
did
not
take
it
should
have
been.
So,
let
us
make
it
little
this
side
this
also
little
this
side.
So,
that
comes
in
yeah
it
has
come
in.
So,
we
come
to
that
we
have
now
that
as
glutamic
acid
this
is
Glu
with
E
as
the
code,
then
phyalanine
with
abbreviation
Phe
code
F,
glycine
with
abbreviation
Gly
and
code
is
G,
histidine
with
an
abbreviation
of
His
and
the
code
is
H,
then
isoleucine
which
has
an
abbreviation
of
Ile
right
though
this
appears
to
be
double
l,
but
not
true
it
is
Ile
and
the
code
is
I,
lysine
with
an
abbreviation
of
Lys
and
the
code
is
l
code
is
K
l
is
not
with
lysine.
And
then
leucine
that
has
an
abbreviation
of
Leu
and
the
code
is
L,
then
we
have
methionine
which
has
abbreviation
of
Met
and
the
code
is
M
capital
M,
then
we
have
asparagine
that
has
one
abbreviation
as
Asn
and
the
code
is
N,
proline
which
has
an
abbreviation
of
Pro
with
a
code
of
P,
then
glutamine
with
an
abbreviation
of
Gln
with
a
code
of
Q.
Arginine
abbreviation
is
Arg
and
code
is
a
capital
R.
And
then
we
have
serine
with
that
Ser
the
other
day
we
were
saying
right
it
is
serine
and
this
abbreviation
is
Ser
and
code
is
S,
then
we
have
threonine
with
an
abbreviation
of
Thr
and
the
code
is
T,
valine
with
an
abbreviation
of
Val
code
is
V,
tryptophan
abbreviation
of
Trp
and
code
is
W
and
tyrosine
with
an
abbreviation
of
Tyr
the
code
is
W
sorry
code
is
Y
right.
So,
we
have
you
see
how
many
numbers
we
have
how
many
numbers;
you
have
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
in
this
side;
in
this
side
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20.
So,
these
20
amino
acids
I
have
the
abbreviation
as
well
the
code
right.
In
many
cases
if
the
code
you
are
not
conversion
then
abbreviation
also,
because
Ala
the
moment
you
right
abbreviated,
then
it
appears
that
this
is
the
amino
acid
alanine
right,
because
the
abbreviation
is
made
in
the
way
which
you
can
easily
pickup
the
actual
amino
acid.
For
example,
arginine
it
is
Arg
right
though
your
code
is
R,
but
your
abbreviation
is
Arg.
So,
Arg
corresponds
to
arginine
right.
So,
this
way
I
just
repeat
once
again;
I
repeat
alanine
Ala
A,
quickly
cysteine
Cyc
C
aspartic
acid
Asp
D,
glutamic
acid
Glu
E,
phyalanine
Phe
F,
glycine
Gly
G,
histidine
His
H,
isoleucine
Ile
I,
lysine
Lys
K.
leucine
Leu
L,
methionine
Met
M,
asparagine
Asn
capital
N,
proline
Pro
P,
glutamine
Gln
Q,
arginine
Arg
R
serine
Ser
S,
threonine
Thr
T,
valine
Val
V,
tryptophan
Trp
W
and
tyrosine
Tyr
Y
right.
So,
this
is
the
abbreviated
as
well
as
coded
name
of
the
different
20
amino
acids
right.Now
a
small
addition
I
would
like
to
make
here
that
there
are
19
primary
amines.
19
primary
amines
and
one
that
is
proline
is
a
secondary
amine
right
and
there
are
19
chiral,
these
all
19
amino
acids
are
chiral
except
glycine
which
is
achiral
right
achiral
and
chiral
then
what
is
chiral?
Chiral
is
that
the
asymmetric
in
such
a
way,
there
is
a
asymmetry
in
such
a
way
that
the
mirror
image
is
not
superimposable
right
mirror
image
now
this
is
one
hand
the
mirror
image
is
this
right.
So,
you
see
that
one
to
one
it
is
coming
and
that
is
called
the
mirror
image
and
this
is
not
superimposable
right
superimposable
we
would
have
been
like
this
or
things
like
that.
So,
the
mirror
image
which
comes
if
because
here
it
is
not
the
mirror
both
the
hands
are
there,
had
it
been
the
mirror
image
then
you
would
have
seen
that
they
are
not
coming
into
superimposing.
So,
if
that
is
superimposable,
then
it
is
I
mean
optical
activity
is
different
isomerism
is
different
all
these
are
there.
So,
19
of
these
amino
acids
are
achiral
chiral,
having
chiral
property
or
chiral
property ,
but
one
out
of
that
that
is
glycine
is
achiral
right.
So,
chiral
we
said,
it
is
the
asymmetry
in
which
the
structure
of
the
original
is
not
superimposable
to
its
mirror
image
right
So,
these
thing
also
adds
to
the
information
of
the
previous
class
as
amino
acids
right
now
we
will
go
forward
for
today
that
is
other
proteins
right
so,
that
is
whey
protein
right.
We
said
earlier
when
we
were
talking
about
the
protein
that
time
that
protein
casein
is
around
80
percent
and
whey
protein
is
around
20
percent
right.
So,
whey
protein
it
contains
hydrophilic
amino
acids
forming
globular
highly
ordered
proteins
that
contain
disulfide
linkages.
It
also
has
hydrophobic
right
hydrophobic
amino
acids
also
that
is
why
it
is
sparingly
soluble
or
it
is
just
soluble
in
water .
Whey
proteins
have
well
developed
secondary
tertiary
and
quaternary
structures
right.
So,
we
have
seen
earlier
in
casein,
it
has
also
primary
secondary
tertiary
and
quaternary
structure.
Whey
protein
also
do
have
secondary
well
developed,
secondary
tertiary
and
quaternary
structures.
Poorer
in
heat
stability ,
but
it
is
much
lesser
heat
stable
than
that
of
the
casein.
You
remember
we
had
said
casein
can
be
heated
even
up
to
150
degree
centigrade
without
degradation,
but
not
so,
with
the
whey
protein.
So,
it
is
poorer
in
heat
stability ,
it
denatures
at
temperature
greater
than
75
degree
centigrade
right.
Hydrophilic
amino
acids
are
aspartate,
glutamine,
glutamate,
histidine,
lysine,
serine,
arginine,
tyrosine
tryptophan,
threonine
and
cysteine
right
these
are
all
which
are
associated
with
the
whey
protein
right.
Then
there
are
two
types
of
primary
whey
proteins
two
types
of
primary
whey
proteins.
So,
one
is
alpha
lactalbumin
and
the
other
is
beta
lactalbumin
right.
So,
this
alpha
and
beta
this
lactalbumin,
they
constitute
around
they
synthesized
in
mammary
gland,
they
are
synthesized
in
mammary
gland
and
approximately
20
and
40
percent
of
the
total
whey
protein
in
bovine
milk
is
composed
of
alpha
and
beta
lactalbumin
20
and
40
percent
respectively;
alpha
lactalbumin
20
percent
beta
lactalbumin
40
percents.
So,
this
20
and
40
you
have
are
there,
in
the
total
protein
present
in
milk
right.
And
they
are
synthesized
in
the
mammary
gland
of
the
mammals
right.
Other
whey
proteins
are
proteose
proteose
peptones
immunoglobulins
serum
albumin
etcetera
some
more
we
will
come
subsequently
as
when
we
are
proceeding
right;
so
proteose
peptone
immunoglobulin
and
serum
albumin.
So,
then
albumin
or
lactalbumin
it
we
will
look
at
it
resembles,
but
not
identical
with
blood
albumin.
I
donâ€™t
know
how
many
of
you
have
seen
or
under gone
blood
test
where
this
albumin
is
also
there.
So,
thats
why
it
resembles
the
blood
albumin,
but
not
identical
with
the
blood
albumin
right.
Dried
form
is
tasteless
powder
chemically
extremely
complex
like
other
proteins.
We
have
seen
that
proteins
they
do
have
big
big
structures
or
polymer
of
many
many
amino
acids,
many
types
of
also
amino
acid
depending
on
the
protein.
So,
there
it
is
also
complex
in
our
alpha
or
lactalbumin
right.
So,
it
contains
sulfur
twice
that
of
the
casein
and
it
contains
no
phosphorus.
So,
in
casein
we
have
seen
we
have
some
sulphur
and
phosphorus,
but
in
particularly
this
lactalbumin
there
is
no
phosphorus,
but
sulphur
is
twice
that
that
present
in
casein
sulfur
content
is
very
high,
but
phosphorus
is
not
there
right.
So,
out
of
which
we
have
said
that
this
is
alpha
lactalbumin
and
beta
lactalbumin
right.
So,
if
you
look
at
alpha
lactalbumin
if
you
look
at
alpha
lactalbumin,
alpha
lactal
lactalbumin
is
spherical
glycosylated
compactly
folded
calcium
metalloprotein
right.
It
is
spherical
glycosylated
compactly
folded
and
calcium
metalloprotein
that
is
alpha
lactalbumin.
And
it
consist
approximately
around
142
numbers
of
amino
acids
142
numbers
of
amino
acids
are
present
in
this
right.
And
not
only
that
and
this
is
approximately
14
kilo
Dalton
in
size
14
kilo
Dalton
in
size.
So,
approximately
14
kilo
Dalton
right;
now,
in
this
respect
let
me
confess
that
the
other
day
perhaps
by
mistake,
I
had
said
that
kilo
Dalton:
kDa
is
an
unit
of
the
unit
of
the
length
or
something
like
that,
but
it
is
not
I
am
if
I
had
done,
I
apologize
that
was
totally
mistake
which
I
after
was
realized,
but
by
the
time
the
class
was
over
subsequent
class
I
did
not
come
to
my
mind
since
that
kilo
Dalton
has
come
again
today .
So,
I
say
that
please
correct
and
that
that
is
kilo
Dalton
is
the
unit
of
mass
of
the
atom.
This
is
mass
of
the
atom
is
express
in
kilo
Dalton
whereas,
the
length
or
that
dimension
right
length
or
that
dimension
in
molecular
level
is
said
in
terms
from
in
terms
of
armstrong
A
right.
So,
one
armstrong
is
equals
to
10
to
the
power
minus
10
meter
right.
One
armstrong
is
10
to
the
power
minus
10
meter
whereas,
this
1
unit
of
kilo
Dalton
is
equal
to
1
kilo
Dalton
is
equals
to.
So,
far
I
remember
it
is
one
point
something
6
may
be
into
10
to
the
power
minus
27.
So,
let
me
write
again
that
this
is
one
kilo
Dalton
is
equals
to
21.6
into
10
to
the
power
minus
27
right
27
what
kg
right
whereas,
one
armstrong
is
equals
to
1
into
10
to
the
power
minus
10
meter .
So,
this
is
the
molecular
mass,
which
I
made
a
mistake
in
the
in
some
class
and
I
after
that
when
it
came
to
my
mind,
because
that
time
perhaps
I
made
the
mistake.
So,
it
is
better
to
accept
it,
because
mistake
is
mistake
that
can
happened
and
it
is
rectified
now
that
this
is
1
Armstrong
is
the
unit
of
the
size
in
the
sense
it
is
dimension
length
or
breadth
or
whatever
right.
Length
breadth
or
whatever
that
is
the
dimensional.
So,
it
has
approximately
what
we
said
142
numbers
of
amino
acids
and
approximately
14
kilo
Dalton
molecular
mass.
It
is
synthesized
and
secreted
by
the
mammary
gland
it
contains
four
disulfide
bonds
again
that
disulfide
if
you
remember
we
had
shown
like
this
that
with
chlorine
and
chlorine,
this
is
the
disulfide
bond
right.
So,
that
is
S
2
c
l
2
is
this
molecular
formula
right.
So,
that
is
there
that
disulfide
bond
is
there,
it
4
disulfide
bonds
are
there
and
8
cysteine
residues
and
is
rich
in
tryptophan.
Three
genetic
variants
have
been
identified
for
this
alpha
lactalbumin
and
it
is
principle
protein
in
human
milk.
So,
this
is
the
principle
protein
in
human
milk
right.
So,
because
it
is
easily
digestible
and
thats
why
nature
has
provided
like
that.
So,
how
you
said
the
study
of
nature,
some
other
class
also
the
uniqueness
right.
Then
beta
globulin
right:
so
beta
globulin
is
sorry
beta
lactalbumin
sorry
beta
lactalbumin
and
this
beta
lactalbumin
is
around
172
amino
acids
are
there.
So,
it
is
composed
of
beta
lactalbumin
around
178
amino
acids
with
an
approximately
molecular
weight
of
18
kilo
Dalton
right.
It
was
14
kilo
Dalton
for
the
alpha.
So,
it
is
18
kilo
Dalton
that
is
the
approximate
n.
There
it
was
around
142
amino
acids
here
it
is
178
amino
acids
right.
So,
thats
why
may
be
the
molecular
mass
is
also
different.
Of
course,
number
does
not
matter
in
that
way,
because
may
be
huge
number ,
but
the
molecular
mass
could
be
less
depending
on
the
assembly
of
the
amino
acids.
But
molecular
mass
is
very
high,
but
number
is
also
low
there
also
can
happen
depending
on
the
individual
amino
acids,
which
are
making
the
protein
or
this
alpha
or
beta
lactalbumin
that
is
the
protein
right.
It
exist
in
both
the
monomeric
and
dimeic
form
at
equilibrium
in
bovine
milk
right.
Both
the
alpha
and
beta
it
exist
in
both
the
monomeric
not
alpha
beta
one
only,
both
monomeric
and
dimeic
form
is
there
monomer
that
is
the
unit
right
and
dimer
the
double
of
that
two
of
them.
So,
but
both
of
them
monomer
and
dimer
are
in
equilibrium
in
bovine
milk
right.
Bovine
means
those
like
cattles
which
are
which
are
reared
at
home
normally
right.
So,
that
bovine
milk
that
of
course,
generally
bovine
corresponds
to
cow,
generally
bovine
acid
amino
of
cow,
but
it
also
can
be
those
which
can
be
reared
at
home
like
this
buffalo
or
some
others
right.
So,
it
exist
in
both
the
both
the
monomeric
and
dimeic
form
and
it
is
at
in
at
equilibrium,
it
is
both
present
equally
they
are
at
equilibrium
that
is
monomer
and
dimer
of
the
beta
lactalbumin
right.
So,
its
association
depends
on
temperature
pH,
then
protein,
then
concentration
protein
concentration
and
ionic
conditions
right.
So,
that
depends
on
these
factors
that
is
temperature
pH
protein
content
or
protein
concentration
and
ionic
conditions.
The
hydrophobic
dimeric
form
linked
by
1
2
3
linked
by
1
2
3
disulfide
bonds
is
approximately
36
kilo
Dalton.
Hydrophobic
dimeric
form
linked
by
1
to
3
right
disulfide
bonds
is
approximately
thirty
six
kilo
Dalton
right.
So,
normally
Dalton
is
expressed
in
d
also,
but
if
you
are
in
some
of
the
books
it
is
also
Da
and
k
is
small
kilo
Dalton
right.
Higher
concentrations
of
beta
lactoglobulin
are
present
in
bovine
milk
that
compare
to
the
human
milk
right.
So,
higher
concentration
of
beta
lactoglobulin
is
present
in
bovine
milk
compare
to
that
in
the
human
milk
right.
So,
that
we
are
coming
to
the
n
of
the
class.So,
let
me
recapitulate
that
we
have
said
there
are
20
amino
acids,
which
we
earlier
we
said
and
we
have
given
the
list
of
the
amino
acids
and
also
we
have
given
the
abbreviated
terms,
abbreviated
amino
acids
or
abbreviations
and
the
code
right
for
example,
I
have
one
small
example
alanine
is
is
abbreviated
as
a
l
a
and
the
coding
is
also
a
right;
like
that
between
a
to
z
20
alphabets
have
been
chosen
and
given
corresponding
code
to
the
amino
acids.
It
is
not
necessarily
that
we
respect
to
the
initial
the
codes
are
given,
but
it
is
like
that
those
codes
are
given
to
alpha
not
alphabetically ,
but
according
to
of
course,
how
the
bigger
and
bigger
complex
things
are
coming
right.
A
little
there
is
there
is
a
little
I
donâ€™t
say
correlation,
but
it
was
maintained
if
alpha
numeric
it
can
be
not
numeric,
alphabetically
it
can
be
arranged
in
a
way
as
close
as
possible
right.
Like
leucine
and
isoleucine
right
or
lysine
and
leucine
they
are
not
having
this
because
both
l
cannot
be
there.
So,
one
was
l
and
one
was
k.
So,
like
that
it
is
all
given.
So,
it
was
and
then
you
went
to
the
whey
protein,
where
we
have
seen
it
is
primarily
alpha
lactalbumin
and
beta
lactalbumin
so
and
then
we
said
about
that,
and
around
20
to
40
percent
of
the
total
protein
present
is
in
this
form
right.
So,
today
we
are
out
of
time.
So,
let
us
stop
it
today .
Thank
you.
