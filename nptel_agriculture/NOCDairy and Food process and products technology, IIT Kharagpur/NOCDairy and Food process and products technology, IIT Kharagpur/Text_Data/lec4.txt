Best
Way
of
Storage
of
Food
Materials
Again
our
course
name
we
should
show
that
this
is
the
Dairy
and
Food
Products
Process
food
process
and
products
technology
right.
So,
in
the
previous
class,
I
was
referring
to
\
that,
refrigerator
storage,
though
we
get
the
definition
any
temperature
between
0
to
-23°C.
And
after
that,
I
said
that
why
it
is
in
most
of
the
books
it
is
written
that
refrigerated
storage
or
cold
storage
or
frozen
storage
is
normally
at
or
below
-18
°C
.
Then
I
raise
this
question
why
-18°C
.
Because
-18°C
is
a
odd
number ,
it
could
have
been
15
it
could
have
been
20
or
25°C
something
like
that
why
typically
-18°C
right.
This
was
the
question
which
I
raised
and;
obviously ,
if
you
look
into
the
history ,
you
will
find
that
this
‘SI’
is
recent
times
right
it
is
recent
times
may
be
couple
of
decades
back
‘SI’
is
come
up.
However ,
before
that,
many
other
units’
nomenclatures
were
there
and
one
of
them
was
‘FPS’
right
and
perhaps
one
of
the
oldest
unit
system.
Therefore,
in
that
‘FPS’
Fahrenheit
is
the
unit
for
the
temperature
right.
So,
things
were
all
measured
in
Fahrenheit’ s
and
the
improvement
of
the
society
or
world
has
taken
up
more
or
less
say
right
from
the
First
World
War
onwards
very
rapidly
right
and
before
that,
we
are
things
were
not
so
much
and
for
movement
from
one
place
to
other
for
business
or
any
other
purpose.
People
had
to
travel
long
and
that
travelling
normally
either
with
some
animal
like
camel
or
horse
or
things
like
that
donkey
whatever
right.
So,
lot
of
time
used
to
be
spent
on
this
travel.
And
since
like
today
you
have
so
many
eateries
here
and
there,
those
things
were
not
there
during
that
time.
So,
people
use
to
also
take
lot
of
food
material
along
with
them.
And
again
sciences
come
up
like
that
from
the
use,
people
who
are
taking
these
and
they
have
experienced
that
if
they
had
travelled
through
the
areas
where
the
temperatures
were
in
that
time,
in
Fahrenheit
0
then
they
were
very
good,
there
was
no
problem
after
consuming.
Nevertheless,
if
it
was
not
so,
then
things
were
rotten
or
gone
wrong
or
infected
right.
1So,
people
came
across,
people
came
to
know
science
to
from
this
that
yes
0
Fahrenheit
is
one
temperature,
where
the
material
food
is
maintaining
its
ability
for
a
long
time.
It
is
not
getting
rotten
it
is
not
getting
pungent
or
any
other .
So,
0
Fahrenheit
was
considered
to
be
the
temperature
at
which
food
material
can
be
stored
for
a
longer
period.
This
is
by
experience
science
is
developed
from
there
and
this
0
Fahrenheit
if
you
convert
it
into
centigrade
you
will
see
that
it
is
coming
somewhere
17
point
something,
some
decimal
as
I
said
somewhere
that
kilo
calorie
9
and
4,
it
is
easy
to
remember
like
just
like
this
0
Fahrenheit
how
much
centigrade
is
just
not
possible
to
say
unless
you
memorize
I
did
not
it
is
17
point
something
right.
So,
to
make
it
whole
number
this
18
came
up,
that
17
point
something
is
not
easy
to
remember .
So,
let
us
make
it
18.
So,
that
is
where
this
0
Fahrenheit
got
converted
into
centigrade
as
0
Fahrenheit
equivalent
to
18
degree
centigrade
to
be
the
temperature
where
food
materials
can
be
kept,
for
a
longer
period
of
time
right.
That
is
how
-18°C
that
came
up
0
Fahrenheit
equivalent
to
-17
point
something
degree
centigrade,
is
roughly
equal
to
-18°C
whole
number
-18
°C
right.
So,
-18
or
below
because
some
time
will
come
after
words,
there
is
a
there
is
a
term
called
Q
10
or
temperature
quotient
right.
Let
me
use
it
now
since
it
has
come,
let
me
use
it
and
let
me
also
try
to
use
this
system
I
can
write
here
this
is
pen.
2(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:54)
𝑄 1 0=𝐾 𝑇+10𝐾 𝑇
So,
the
above
equation
is
referred
as
Q
10
or
as
temperature
quotient
right.
It
is
defined
as
the
rate
of
reaction
at
any
temperature
T,
this
T
can
be
any
to
that
at
T
plus
10ºC
right.
So,
Q
10
will
be
say
if
it
is
20°C
if
T
is
plus
20
°C
,
then
if
you
will
make
this
plus
20°C
.
So,
K
30
over
K
20
,
this
roughly
can
be
said
to
be
equals
to
2
right.
Therefore,
any
rate
of
reaction
any
reaction
be
it
chemical,
be
it
microbial,
be
it
biochemical
or
enzymatic,
any
kind
of
reaction
will
follow
these
simple
temperature
quotient
law.
That
a
temperature
at
a
reaction;
at
a
temperature
say
20
degree,
if
the
temperature
is
raised
by
10°C
.
So,
that
is
30°C,
then
the
rates
of
reaction
which
were
at
20°C
will
now
become
double
at
30°C
then
that
at
20°C
right.
Similarly ,
if
we
increase
from
30°C
by
10°C
to
40°C
then
the
rates
of
reaction
is
doubled
from
that
at
30°C
rather
it
is
doubled
at
40°C
then
that
at
30°C
.
So,
likewise
if
we
go
on
increasing
so,
each
10
°C
is
making
double
of
the
rates
of
reaction,
then
that
at
the
previous
10°C
right.
So,
this
is
rates
of
reactions
are
increasing
right
all
rates
of
reactions
again
be
it
chemical,
be
it
biochemical,
be
it
enzymatic,
be
it
microbial
any
kind
of
reactions
that
will
follow
this
if
it
is
for
increase
of
temperature
now
if
you
do
the
reverse
right.
3
So,
from
30-20°C
to
30°C
it
was
double
roughly
right.
I
am
not
saying
that
chemical
also
will
give
2
biochemical
also
will
give
2
enzymatic
also
will
give
2
or
microbial
also
will
give
2,
there
is
no
such
equation
that
it
will
be
2,
but
their
numbers
are
very
close
to
2.
So,
roughly
that
is
why
I
have
given
this
symbol
roughly .
So,
roughly
it
can
be
said
to
be
doubled
right
for
understanding.
And
if
the
reverse
is
done
that
is
if
the
rates
temperatures
are
lowered
by
10°C.
So,
from
30°C
whatever
it
was,
at
20°C
it
will
become
half
of
that
that
is
inverse
of
2
that
is
half
right.
From
10-
20°C
if
it
is
low
at
by
10°C
to
10°C
then
whatever
rates
of
reactions
were
at
20°C
now
it
will
become
half
of
that
at
10°C
right.
So,
this
way
if
you
go
on
decreasing
from
10
to
0,
0
to
10,
-10
to
-20
like
that
as
we
are
decreasing
then
the
rates
of
reactions
are
also
decreasing
that
is
why
-18
we
said
0
Fahrenheit
equivalent
to
-18,
that
is
the
temperature
where
we
assume
that
the
rates
of
reactions
will
be
minimum
and
there
will
be
no
microbial
decay ,
microbial
growth,
microbial
spoilage
or
enzymatic
spoilage
at
the
most
they
will
be
under
dormant
stage
right.
This
is
the
philosophy
on
which
the
cooling
is
entirely
dependent
on
right
cooling
storage
or
long
term
storage
under
refrigeration,
under
freezing,
under
present
condition
is
fundamentally
because
of
this
that
if
you
are
lowering
the
temperature
by
10°C
the
rates
of
reaction
is
becoming
half.
So,
each
10°C
lowering
will
make
the
temperature
half
of
that.
I
will
make
the
reactions
half
of
that.
So,
that
could
be
chemical,
biochemical;
I
gave
the
example
that
you
have
taken
fat
and
that
fat
is
converted
into
glucose
by
the
body .
So,
that
was
possible
only
by
some
biochemical
reactions.
One
of
the
good
book
which
book
I
am
not
given
the
names
afterwards
perhaps
I
will
give,
that
one
of
the
very
good
book
on
biochemical
not
part
of
this
course
is
‘Leninger ’
on
biochemistry .
You
will
see
lots
of
cycles
are
there
right
from
here
it
started
one
product
then
another ,
then
another ,
then
another ,
then
another ,
then
another ,
then
another
like
that
if
cycle
is
being
formed
right
for
example,
one
such
cycle
is
called
‘TCA ’
cycle
or
respiration
is
also
under
that
similar
cycle
that
is
also
under
cycle
right,
it
comes
from
that
glucose
and
makes
carbon
dioxide
water
and
energy
and
that
is
under
respiration
cycle
you
will
get
it
in
Leninger .
This
4is
not
under
this
purview
of
this
class,
but
as
a
reference
I
am
telling
that
you
go
to
that
book
and
see,
lot
many
things
are
given
understand
biochemical
right.
So,
these
reactions
are
minimized,
as
the
temperature
is
lower
from
any
temperature
to
10°C
less
than
that
temperature.
So,
depending
on
what
the
product;
obviously ,
a
product
whose
cost
is
50
paise
say
or
1
rupee
1
rupee
a
kg,
you
will
and
though
if
you
bring
it
to
-20°C
,
it
may
stay
for
12
months
say
for
the
sake
of
saying
if
we
assume.
Obviously ,
you
will
not
keep
because
for
making
it
-20°C
,
you
have
to
spend
money
why
should
unnecessarily
one
product
whose
availability
if
it
is
high
or
price
is
so,
low
that
is
one
rupee
per
kg;
that
means,
it
is
plenty
available,
that
is
why
it
is
1
kg
1
rupee
had
it
been
not
available
so
much
then
its
price
would
have
gone
up.
So,
which
one
you
will
keep
at
which
temperature
many
factors
will
come
forward
it
is
not
a
single
parameter
by
which,
you
will
judge,
you
will
decide
I
will
do
this
based
on
many
things
and
maybe
something
is
consumed
so
much
that
within
2
couple
of
months
this
is
consumed.
You
do
not
need
to
unnecessarily
extend
for
years
together .
So,
why
unnecessarily
additional
a
effort
will
make
additional
cost
you
will
incur
so,
that
the
price
becomes
high
and
the
requirements
are
low.
So,
depending
on
that
market
demand
supply
everything
you
will
decide
what
to
do,
when
to
do,
how
to
do
right.
So,
this
Q
10
remember
this
is
one
very
good
example
or
information
to
keep
in
mind
in
terms
of
any
processing
and
preservation
right.
So,
we
come
back
so,
that
we
tried
and
now
again
coming
back
to
that.
5(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:45)
So,
we
can
now
say
that
we
can
divide
in
terms
this
Q
10
is
one
such
right
and
we
earlier
also
said
that
if
you
remove
the
moisture,
then
in
that
definition
of
so
many
perishable,
nonperishable,
naturally
perishable
those
definitions
we
have
said
that,
if
you
are
removing
moisture
to
the
level
where
the
organisms
cannot
grow .
So,
that
level
will
allow
you
to
keep
the
food
material
for
a
longer
period
right.
So,
in
this
term
another
scientific
term
will
come
up
there
is
called
water
activity .
Normally
the
moisture
level
in
the
food
we
call
that
in
terms
of
water
activity .
By
simple
definition,
it
is
defined
as
the
ratio
of
two
pressures
a
one
vapour
pressure
of
moisture
in
the
food
material
at
the
temperature
because
pressure
is
a
function
of
temperature.
So,
at
a
given
temperature
the
vapour
pressure
of
moisture
in
the
food
material
to
that
vapour
pressure
of
pure
water
at
that
temperature,
that
is
a
simple
definition
of
water
activity .
So,
in
terms
of
understanding
then
we
can
say
that
availability
of
water
right
water
activity
in
other
words
say
the
availability
of
moisture
for
the
organisms
to
grow
or
multiply
your
act
right.
So,
water
activity
in
terms
of
that
when
we
are
referred
we
refer
to
dry.
So,
they
are
again
since
it
is
coming
up
let
me
also
say
here.
As
I
said
no
though
it
cannot
be
within
a
frame
wall
of
this
that
will
courses
has
to
be
like
that.
We
are
so,
many
ancillary
things
do
come
up
which
as
teacher
we
think
that,
if
it
is
also
shared
with
you
then
that
may
help
you
in
understanding
right.
So,
like
that
a
water
activity
came
up
and
the
moment
water
activity
6
came
up,
then
also
I
should
also
said
that
there
are
microor ganisms,
there
are
basically
we
can
divide
there
are
n
numbers
n
variety
is
everything,
but
we
can
divide
for
food,
we
can
divide
them
in
three
parts;
one
is
bacteria
and
other
is
mold
and
third
one
is
yeast.
So,
bacteria,
yeast,
mold
these
are
the
three
categories
of
organisms
right.
In
terms
of
water
activity ,
bacterial
growth
action
everything
is
around
0.9
or
above
in
terms
of
water
activity .
I
define
water
activity
again;
it
is
the
ratio
of
vapour
pressure
of
moisture
in
the
food
material
at
a
temperature
T
to
that,
the
vapour
pressure
of
pure
water
at
that
temperature
T
right.
So,
if
that
water
activity
is
0.9
or
above,
then
bacteria
can
survive
will
grow
and
multiply
and
do
all
the
actions.
If
it
is
less
than
0.9
then
bacteria
goes
out
it
cannot
do
any
activities
we
cannot
survive.
Then
comes
yeast
roughly
again
as
I
said
there
is
a
that
that
that
Q
10
,
2
wise
gave
example
that
is
the
representative
number .
So,
this
0.9
is
also
representative
if
does
not
mean
all
bacterial
will
be
like
that
there
could
be
some
difference
right,
but
by
and
large
so,
that
is
how
we
generalized.
So,
point
nine
will
be
bacteria
if
it
is
less
than
that,
say
0.8
water
activity ,
then
why
it
is
becoming
then
fraction?
Because
the
pure
water
has
higher
vapour
pressure
than
that
in
the
food
because
food
it
is
not
only
moisture
along
with
that
some
other
things
are
there.
So,
it
is
lowering
down
the
vapour
pressure.
So,
vapour
pressure
act
at
a
given
temperature
of
the
pure
of
the
moisture
in
food
material
to
that
vapour
pressure
of
pure
water
at
that
temperature
is
the
water
activity .
So,
0.8
is
the
water
activity
where
yeast
can
grow
0.8
and
above,
yeast
can
grow
a
multiply
and
do
good
thing
bad
thing
whatever
activities
right.
Bacteria
also
do
it
is
not
that
all
bacteria
enemy
yeah
they
can
be
good,
they
can
be
bad
depending
on
where
how
you
are
using
where
how
they
are
acting.
So,
0.8
above
yeast
0.9
above
bacteria,
0.7
above
mold
right.
So,
if
you
bring
down
the
water
activity
below
0.6,
then
problem
with
moisture
is
out.
So,
in
all
dried
material
this
water
activity
level
comes
down,
in
many
cases
it
comes
down
much
more,
but
this
is
one
factor
which
place
into
right.
So,
if
you
look
at
this
tree
where
how
we
can
keep
food
material
if
we
look
into
that,
you
see
we
can
saying
that
food
if
it
is
in
presence
of
air
then
all
three
types
of
organisms
that
is
aerobic,
bacteria,
yeast
or
mold
or
three
can
grow
in
presence
of
air.
So,
under
that
at
thigh
moisture
level
it
is
aerobic,
bacteria
yeast
and
mold
all
three
needs
moisture
high
moisture
level
they
can
grow .
7If
it
is
a
low
moisture
level
then
bacteria
yeast
cannot
grow
only
mold
can
grow
right
only
mold
can
grow
but
if
it
is
like
that
in
absence
of
air,
then
anaerobic
bacteria
not
aerobic
bacteria.
Anaerobic
bacteria
can
grow
along
with
that
yeast
also
can
grow
mold
cannot
grow
because
mold
needs
air
as
well
moisture.
If
moisture
is
also
less
still
mold
can
grow ,
but
air
is
a
must.
So,
it
is
aerobic,
but
anaerobic
organisms
anaerobic
bacteria
is
also
there
yeast
is
also
there.
So,
they
can
grow
at
this
low
in
absence
of
air.
So,
anaerobic
bacteria
and
yeast
can
grow .
Again
it
comes
if
it
is
high
moisture
then
both
of
them
anaerobic
and
yeast
can
grow
and
multiply
and
do
a
action,
but
if
it
is
in
low
moisture,
then
none
of
them
because
we
have
seen
here
low
moisture
only
mold
can
grow
in
aerobic
here
also
in
aerobic
none
of
them
yeast
mold
bacteria,
none
of
them
can
grow .

So,
ideal
situation
condition
is
that
we
should
get
we
should
get
ideal
condition
is
that
we
should
get
we
should
get
low
moisture
and
in
absence
of
air
we
should
be
able
to
preserve
it
for
long
period.
But
it
is
ideal
situation
maybe
many
food
materials
do
not
come
under
this
purview .
So,
that
is
why
this
ideal
situation
may
or
may
not
be
suitable
for
all
the
food
materials,
but
ideally
we
can
tell
that
this
is
the
situation
for
all
the
food
materials
can
stay
for
a
very
very
long
period
right.
So,
I
told
you
the
other
day
that
I
will
give
you
the
difference.
So,
these
are
the
some

the

D.R.
Tainter

A.T.
Grenis
and
but
I
normally
follow
and
like
very
much
that
is
principles
of
food
science
by
Marcus
Karel,
Owen
R.
Fennema
and
D.B.
Lund.
This
book
is
known
as
the
book
in
the
name
of
Fennema.
Fennema
only
if
you
go
and
tell
that
library
and
or
somebody
will
bring
that
typical
book
only
this
book
only.
So,
it
is
known
by
Fenneama
and
this
is
a
very
good
well
written.
Nowadays
the
books
which
are
available
most
of
them
are
either
it
is
taken
from
one
or
other
or
may
be
may
be
most
of
the
cases
that
it
is
edited
books
right.
So,
lot
of
writers
are
contributing
contributed
book,
they
are
not
on
the
basic
or
basic
principles,
but
these
books
are
on
the
basic
principle
Fenneama
is
one
of
the
best.
Thank
you.
