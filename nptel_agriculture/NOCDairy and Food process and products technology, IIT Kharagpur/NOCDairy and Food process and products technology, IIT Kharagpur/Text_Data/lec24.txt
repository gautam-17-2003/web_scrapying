Milk
Fat
(Contd.)
So,
in
the
last
class
we
were
discussing
in
this
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology ,
right.
W e
were
discussing
about
the
milk
fat.
So,
today
we
also
continue
because
it
was
not
over ,
so
it
is
continued
on
milk
fat.
So,
what
we
have
seen
that
there
are
many
factors
which
controlled
the
come
both
the
quantity
and
also
the
quality
of
the
milk
fat
that
is
the
compositional
behavior
or
compositional
variation
in
the
milk
fat
that
is
being
controlled
by
many
many
factors
we
have
discussed,
right.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
another
thing
very
important
and
very
interesting
that
is
this
that
milk
is
such
a
this
of
course,
I
have
taken
from
some
source
may
be
from
some
net.
I
for got
to
write
that
references
here
should
have
been.
Ah
Here
you
see
that
milk
fat
or
the
milk
rather
it
contains
dif ferent
phases.
For
example,
you
see
we
have
given
in
this
rather
in
this
pictorial
view
size
in
millimeter
nanometer ,
size
in
nanometer
it
is
given
and
elements
they
are
given
forms
what
forms
they
are
available
and
whether
it
is
what
element
and
in
what
form
they
are
present
that
is
being
depicted
in
this
picture,
right.
Y ou
see
here
it
is
from
10
to
the
power
4
to
10
to
the
power
minus
1,
right;
10
to
the
power
4
to
10
to
the
power
minus
one
in
nanometer
it
is
there,
right.
So,
there
you
see
that
fat
globules
are
like
this
so
big,
fat
globules
are
like
this
it
is
around
say
10
or
maybe
100
between
10
to
100
nanometer
size.
So,
that
is
around
maybe
may
be
1
to
10
micron,
right.
So,
depending
on
the
size
becomes
fat
globules
are
also
shown
in
smaller
size,
this
is
a
bigger
size,
this
is
a
in
between
size
though
they
are
pictorially .
So,
it
does
not
mean
that
this
comes
1
only
10.
So,
10
to
the
power
4
nanometer;
that
means,
10
micron,
right.
So,
that
is
the
fat
globule
size.
Microor ganisms
they
can
be
very
small
depending
on
the
size.
So,
they
are
also
maybe
1
or
even
half
micron
or
0.5
micron
or
even
lower
or
may
be
a
little
bigger
depending
on
the
or ganism.
Then
this
is
a
microor ganism
scale
ok,
fat
globules
are
of
this
size
caseins
are
of
this
size
and
whey
protein
are
of
this
size,
and
lactose
and
water
they
are
of
this
size,
right.
So,
what
we
see
that
if
this
be
a
true
solution,
right
then
the
smaller
units
are
whey
proteins,
right
which
are
smaller
in
size,
whey
proteins
then
we
also
have,
so
this
kind
of
thing
where
this
is
casein,
right.
So,
this
are
casein
micelle
and
these
are
fat
globules
and
these
are
microor ganisms.
So,
this
is
one
milk
unique
as
we
have
said
earlier
also.
So,
this
is
a
true
solution
of
lactose
or
soluble
things
true
solution
this
is
also
a
colloidal
suspension
of
this
casein
right.
This
whey
protein
normal
it
is
soluble.
So,
caseins
which
is
in
oh
sorry
not
that
caseins
which
is
this
that
is
in
colloidal
suspension
and
a
stable
emulsion
that
is
the
fat
globules,
they
are
in
stable
emulsions
these
are
fat
globules.
So,
it
contains
all
3,
all
3
phases
that
is
true
solution
colloidal
suspension
as
well
as
emulsion
by
the
respective
components
elements
which
you
have
said,
right.
So,
they
can
be
like
your
salts
they
are
in
solution
maybe
or ganisms,
if
there
in
solution
then
they
can
be
whey
protein
in
solution
or
there
are
caseins
which
are
in
suspension
and
that
is
called
colloid
or
colloidal
suspension
and
some
emulsion
that
is
fat
which
is
present
in
milk.
So,
this
is
a
unique
system
where
all
3
phases
that
is
true
solution,
colloidal
suspension
and
emulsion
all
3
exist
and
is
a
stable,
that
is
the
primary
thing
and
the
entire
thing
is
stable,
right.
So,
by
since
in
the
stability
and
all
these
phases
are
coming
up.
So,
in
this
regard
let
me
also
tell
or
exchange
share
one
information
that
today
whatever
milk
is
has
in
the
some
class
I
say
took
the
reference
of
Dr .
Kurien
who
is
renowned
and
who
is
the
I
mean
who
is
regarded
as
the
white
revolutionary
person
and
who
brought
a
white
revolution.
And
ah,
but
even
then
even
then
today
we
are
having
lot
of
milk
problem
because
population
is
growing
up,
but
the
production
or
availability
of
milk
is
not
going
up.So,
in
that
case
what
is
happening
day
by
day
the
price
of
milk
is
going
up
and
since
other
cost,
like
fuel
cost
transportation
cost
these
are
also
going
up
someday
it
will
come
that
the
price
of
milk
is
very
very
high,
price
of
milk
is
very
very
high
someday
it
will
come
up
and
when
it
will
come
up
that
time
this
will
be
a
major
problem.
Now ,
what
you
are
doing?
Y ou
just
think
from
one
place
say
Gujarat
to
say
Bengal
you
are
transporting
milk
say
somewhere
around
say
2000
kilometers.
So,
this
2000
kilometers
you
are
transporting
say
1000
litre
or
say
10000
liter
of
milk
in
a
container .
Y ou
have
every
other
thing
that
is
maintenance
of
temperature
etcetera
all
other
things
are
fine.
But
since
you
are
bringing
10000
liter
from
Gujarat
to
Bengal
your
transportation
cost
whatever
if
we
that
is
being
added
to
the
price
which
you
have
bought
from
Gujarat,
right.
And
obviously ,
as
it
is
being
seen
that
with
time
this
price
is
going
up
because
transportation
cost
is
also
going
up.
But
technological
or
scientifically
you
think
that
what
you
are
bringing
from
Gujarat
around
80
to
90
percent
of
water
and
rest
is
the
solids
that
is
total
solid
in
terms
of
solid
not
fat
and
fat.
Now ,
by
some
means
that
by
some
means
is
a
technological
challenge,
by
some
means
if
you
can
bring
down
this
water
content
from
80
to
90
percent
to
30
to
40
percent,
or
even
lower
without
mind
it
without
changing
the
characteristic
behavior
of
the
solid
milk
solid
total
fat
and
non
fat
than
you
are
bringing
down
your
transportation
cost
whatever
it
was
for
80
to
90
percent
moisture
down
to
10
to
20
percent.
So,
huge
quantity
of
milk
you
are
bringing
which
after
reaching
you
rehydrate
and
make
it
like
that
whatever
milk
was,
because
in
milk
we
said
that
it
is
a
it
is
a
unique
stable
all
3
all
3
phases
are
their
solution
colloid
as
well
as
emulsion
and
liquid
that
is
water
being
the
primary
or
the
that
continuous
phase.
So,
any
property
change
by
addition
extra
will
be
with
respect
to
water
because
that
is
the
continuous
phase.
So,
when
you
are
adding
water
there
it
is
also
they
are
getting
diluted.
So,
from
a
concentrated
milk
you
are
now ,
diluting
the
primary
challenge
to
you
as
scientist
of
technologist
is
that
how
without
changing
the
quality
of
the
food
components
that
is
milk
fat
and
on
solid
not
fat
and
without
increasing
the
price.
If
the
price
of
that
is
more
than
your
transportation
cost
nobody
will
take,
right.
So,
till
date
science
is
getting
this
challenge
till
date
if
solution
has
not
come
up.
I
hope
someday
you
as
student
will
come
forward
and
do
this
miracle
and
then
definitely
another
we
are
this
thing
another
your
white
revolution
will
come
up,
right.
White
revolution
not
only
byproduction,
but
also
by
utilization
you
can
make
right.
So,
this
you
keep
please
keep
in
mind
and
in
someday
we
are
trying
in
our
lab
the
what
I
was
why
it
has
come
up,
because
that
it
is
a
though
it
is
a
stable,
but
it
is
a
true
solution
colloidal
suspension
and
emulsion
all
these
3
together
when
you
are
trying
to
separate
water
by
some
means
then
it
is
very
dif ficult
keeping
all
this
3
stable
and
you
can
extract
water ,
right.
The
moment
you
are
extracting
water
it
is
not
only
fat
and
casein
that
is
the
colloid
some
lot
of
lot
of
soluble
solids
are
also
there.
So,
they
also
will
come
out
with
the
with
the
water .
So,
this
is
a
great
challenge,
and
also
imposing
to
you
if
some
solution
you
can
as
engineer
scientist
or
technologist
whatever
you
call
if
you
can
come
forward
it
will
be
a
great
help
to
the
dairy
people
or
to
the
as
a
whole
nation
and
you
can
make
a
revolution
in
that,
ok.
So,
it
is
a
true
solution
cum
it
is
a
colloid
and
it
is
a
emulsion,
right.
So,
relative
size
of
the
particles
are
like
this
from
there
we
have
seen
let
me
clear
out
this,
right.
So,
relative
size
of
the
particles
in
milk
are
in
millimeter
between
10
to
the
power
2
to
10
to
the
power
minus
3
that
is
fat
globules,
right.
Between
10
to
the
power
minus
4
to
10
to
the
power
minus
5
it
is
casein
or
calcium
phosphate
together
combination,
casein
calcium
phosphate
combination
between
10
to
the
power
minus
4
to
10
to
the
power
minus
5
millimeter
in
size.
Between
10
to
the
power
minus
5
to
10
to
the
power
minus
6
millimeter
in
size
this
is
the
whey
proteins
and
between
10
to
the
power
minus
6
to
10
to
the
power
minus
7
it
is
all
other
soluble
size
lactose,
salts
and
other
substances
in
true
solution,
right.
So,
milk
contains
variable
size
of
particles
ranging
from
10
to
the
power
minus
2
millimeter
to
10
to
the
power
minus
7
millimeter ,
right.
So,
such
a
wide
variation
of
the
particle
size
out
of
which
fat
globules
between
10
to
the
power
minus
2
to
minus
3
millimeter ,
right.
And
casein
between
10
to
the
power
minus
4
to
minus
5,
whey
protein
minus
5
to
minus
6
and
the
soluble
fractions
that
is
lactose,
salts
and
many
other
soluble
parts
in
water
between
10
to
the
power
minus
6
to
10
to
the
power
minus
7,
right.
So,
if
we
now ,
recapitulate
what
we
had
said
earlier
that
the
problem
of
fat
in
milk
is
primarily
due
to
the
species,
primarily
due
to
again
the
feed,
this
to
if
species
and
the
feed
you
have
the
control
you
can
both
increase
the
fat
content
as
well
as
the
quantity
of
the
milk
which
comes
out,
right.
So,
quantity
of
milk
which
comes
out
that
also
you
can
produce
you
can
take
more
if
you
have
a
true
control
in
it,
right.
So,
we
can
say
that
if
we
can
reduce
the
transportation
cost,
if
we
can
produce
more
quantity
of
milk,
if
we
can
produce
good
quality
of
milk
fat
then
we
can
cater
the
nation
much
much
better
way ,
much
much
finer
way .
In
this
respect
what
I
just
referred
earlier
that
we
have
been
also
doing
yes
we
are
trying
there
is
a
process,
there
is
a
engineering
process
by
which
it
is
called
the
separation
by
freezing,
right.
So,
that
is
concentration
of
milk
with
freezing,
right.
So,
that
if
we
can
adopt
we
are
trying
when
it
is
getting
frozen
I
of
course,
this
is
not
part
of
this
class
freezing,
but
still
let
me
tell
that
when
you
are
freezing
what
is
happening,
you
are
depending
on
because
freezing
is
primary
dependent
on
the
rate
at
which
you
are
removing
the
heat
the
temperature
dif ference
between
the
refrigerant
and
the
material
to
be
frozen
and
also
on
the
degree
of
super
cooling.
I
don’ t
know
whether
you
know
it
or
not
that
if
you
look
at
the
freezing
curve
then
from
initial
point
wherever
you
are
studying
say
maybe
room
temperature,
when
it
comes
down
to
the
at
a
temperature
where
still
it
is
not
freezing,
but
lower
than
the
initial
freezing
point
and
that
point
is
non
as
degree
of
super
cooling.
So,
after
the
super
cooling
it
goes
and
it
goes
and
forms
the
nucleus
and
this
formation
of
crystal
being
exothermic
that
temperature
again
goes
up
to
the
initial
freezing
point
and
then
hypothetically
there
is
a
plateau.
Hypothetically ,
why?
Because
they
are
also
your
Raoult's
law
come
into
that
as
the
concentration
as
some
quantity
of
moisture
gets
frozen,
remaining
solution
is
getting
concentrated.
So,
the
more
concentration
it
is
happening
by
Raoult's
law
the
lowering
is
the
freezing
point
temperature
or
depression
of
freezing
point
that
is
from
the
Raoult's
law ,
right.
So,
when
it
is
happening
that
time
your
change
is
temperature
or
change
in
the
freezing
point
is
continuously
happening.
That
is
why
in
practice
it
is
not
a
plateau
or
theoretical
plateau
which
can
be
the
like
if
you
if
you
just
draw
it
is
like
this
that
if
this
is
the
freezing
curve,
and
if
this
is
the
temperature
and
if
this
is
the
time,
then
the
time
temperature
communication
comes
like
this
and
then
this
like
that,
right.Since
it
is
with
this
kind
of
pen.
So,
this
is
that
this
plateau
is
normally
not
possible,
this
plateau
is
normally
not
possible
because
the
moment
you
came
here
this
is
called
the
degree
of
supper
cooling,
right.
This
is
called
the
degree
of
super
cooling.
So,
when
your
super
cooling
to
that
temperature,
right.
And
this
is
corresponding
to
the
temperature
here,
right.
So,
and
this
is
a
initial
freezing
point.
So,
this
is
a
T
i
and
this
is
the
T
super
cooling,
right.
So,
when
it
is
arriving
at
that
super
cooling
point,
so
because
here
it
is
forming
the
starting
beginning
of
the
nucleus
formation.
So,
crystal
formation
takes
places.
So,
there
is
a
exothermic,
so
the
temperature
goes
up
to
this
and
then
theoretically
all
whatever
fusible
water
is
there
that
is
getting
transformed
into
water
at
this
temperature
constant
theoretically ,
right.
But
practically
what
is
happening?
The
moments
sum
as
already
taken
care
of
already
have
frozen
then
the
initial
freezing
point
here
and
remaining
part
concentration
part
goes
up.
So,
it
went
down,
right.
It
went
down.
So,
from
that
it
comes
like
this
and
then
it
follows
this,
this
is
actually
the
real
time
real
this
one
is
the
real,
but
this
is
the
not
hypothetical
I
should
say
ideal,
right.
So,
whatever
be
when
you
are
freezing,
so
what
is
happening?
Y ou
are
making
that
ice,
right.
Now ,
in
milk
it
being
not
only
a
solution,
but
also
emulsion
also
a
colloid.
So,
taking
out
what
and
all
are
in
combination
it
is
not
that
they
are
isolated
you
take
if
this
be
the
glass
of
milk,
right.
Y ou
take
one
drop
and
then
analyzed
its
composition
whatever
it
is
you
take
another
drop
find
out
its
composition
it
will
have
the
same,
right.
That
is
it
is
a
homogenous
mixture,
right.
So,
if
from
that
homogeneity
if
you
are
going
to
disturb
by
maybe
freezing
or
maybe
some
other
method
then
it
is
very
dif ficult
to
break
that
and
take
water
away
from
that
that
is
why
whenever
we
could
have
achieved
around
from
90
percent
moisture
to
around
say
70
percent,
but
in
the
end
process
we
have
lost
a
little
both
fat
a
little
your
casein
as
well
the
soluble
solids
these
we
have
lost.
So,
initially
whatever
composition
we
have
started
with
90
percent,
say
10
percent
soluble
solid
or
total
solid
not
soluble
total
solid.
Now ,
when
we
came
back
when
we
could
arrive
around
70
percent,
that
time
it
is
not
that
this
70
percent
also
contains
equivalent
to
that
10
percent
total
solid
it
is
less
than
that,
right.
Because
we
go
whenever
we
you
are
making
that
ice
these
ice
is
also
carrying
soluble
solids
some
fact
some
casein,
right.
So,
it
is
a
very
challenging
one
by
which
you
can
separate
this
water
from
the
rest.
But
again
I
am
telling
today
is
what
is
impossible
tomorrow
is
the
best
thing
it
may
be
possible,
right.
So,
100
years
back
we
did
not
people
I
do
not
know
nobody
is
alive
or
if
they
are
they
cannot
remember ,
but
if
you
see
the
history
whatever
100
years
back
things
were
not
imaginable
now
they
are
at
your
hand.
Now ,
whatever
now ,
is
not
imaginable
may
be
after
some
days
they
was
at
in
your
hand.
So,
who
knows
who
can
break
this,
and
if
really
any
one
of
you
or
I
am
not
only
saying
you
if
anyone
can
make
and
break
this
that
the
price
of
the
transportation
cost
if
that
can
be
minimized
you
make
a
breakthrough.
This
is
a
real
day
in
the
dairy
science
their
engineering,
this
is
a
real
breakthrough
that
you
can
make,
right.
So,
this
you
keep
in
mind.
And
not
only
that
pass
it
on,
this
is
not
a
not
a
dairy
problem
this
is
a
more
engineering
or
science
problems
than
any
other
as
well
economic
problem
because
from
now
onwards
next
after
decade
when
you
will
become
suf ficiently
grown
up
you
will
be
doing
your
normal
family
life
that
time
you
will
see
now
you
are
buying
milk
may
be
40
rupees
a
litre.
So,
that
time
maybe
after
a
decade
it
will
come
out
to
some
80,
70-80
rupees
a
litre
and
it
is
not
that
if
you
are
getting
today
some
say
1
lakh
rupees
month
salary
and
they
are
you
will
get
2
lakh
rupees
a
month
salary .
So
that
never;
when
this
price
of
this
commodity
increases
the
salary
or
corresponding
earning
that
does
not
increase
in
the
same
proportion,
so
you
will
also
have
the
same
problem.
Y ou
will
also
face
a
similar
problem
until
and
unless
this
solution
is
made,
because
day
by
day
the
most
of
the
vacant
plane
is
being
occupied
by
the
human
being
only
becausepopulation
is
also
growing.
I
do
not
say
I
do
not
know
whether
it
is
exponentially
or
not,
but
definitely
it
is
increasing
every
year ,
year
by
year ,
right.
Whether
the
nature
is
exponential
or
curvilinear
I
have
no
idea,
but
it
is
true
that
it
is
increasing
and
this
increase
is
not
as
per
with
the
increase
of
other
associated
things.
So,
this
challenge
I
put
to
you
that
you
come
forward
with
some
solution
that
how
you
can
eliminate
the
transportation
of
water
in
the
milk.
So,
that
the
more
quantity
of
very
concentrated
milk
you
can
shift
from
one
place
to
other
place
reducing
the
transportation
cost,
there
by
you
are
reducing
the
price
of
the
unit
of
the
milk
that
is
per
litre
it
will
be
it
can
be
brought
down
drastically .
Then
only
it
will
be
a
breakthrough,
then
only
you
can
bring
another
white
revolution
in
the
country ,
right.
So,
this
you
just
think
and
if
you
have
any
solution,
you
can
pass
on
to
us
you
can
pass
on
to
anybody
you
can
do
it
yourself
or
you
can
take
help
of
some
people,
but
the
idea
should
come
and
that
is
where
you
need
to
know
some
other
subjects
as
well
the
engineering,
that
is
a
very
fundamental
the
engineering
parts
also
you
must
know
along
with
the
science
part,
ok.
So,
this
we
stop
today
we
are
finished
the
fat.
Next
we
will
go
to
protein,
and
everywhere
as
we
are
saying
that
we
start
with
the
beginning
or
preliminary
things.
So,
that
associated
things
sciences
is
also
recaptured
or
recapitulated
or
brushed
up
so
that
we
will
also
try
for
protein,
ok.
Thank
you.
