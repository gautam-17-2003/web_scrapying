Products
Hello
students,
we
are
now
on
the
verge
of
completion
of
the
course.
Today
is
the
60th
class
of
these
Dairy
and
Food
Products,
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology .
And
since
we
have
covered
a
lot
I
feel
that
I
should
also
share
with
you
some
of
the
data
which
we
generated
in
our
laboratory
classes,
or
in
our
rather
I
should
say
PhD
programs
because
these
are
authentic
data
our
students
have
done
it.
And
let
me
share
with
you
manufacturing
some
of
the
both
dairy
and
food
products.
I
am
not
saying
in
that
entire
gamut
of
the
dairy
and
food
products
we
can
show .
But
few
of
them
which
are
which
we
have
done
in
our
lab
by
our
students
again
they
got
their
degree
PhD
so
their
data
are
authentic
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:39)
So,
we
come
to
our
60th
lecture;
that
is
Flow
Chart
for
manufacturing
some
dairy
and
food
products
right.
So,
this
is
some
flow
charts
we
will
be
showing
you
and
this
data
are
authentic
right.
1
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:54)
Flow
Charts
Process
and
Material
Flow
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
02:03)
So,
in
this
first
we
see
that
chhana
from
buffalo
milk
right.
We
are
taken
buffalo
milk
and
from
that
we
have
quantitatively
formed
chhana
right.
Chhana
we
have
said
earlier
that
is
the
acid
coagulation
product
of
milk
right.
So,
that
acid
coagulation
how
best
you
can
get
maximum
chhana
so
that
is
debatable
right.
The
reason
being
the
milk
with
which
you
are
starting
that
milk
will
contain
different
fat
content
and
SNF
2
So,
until
and
unless
you
have
the
source
or
raw
material
identical
your
end
product
will
not
be.
So,
that
is
why
it
took
several
months
or
years
to
come
to
these
statistics
or
data.
And
we
could
make
a
streamline
provided
again
you
have
the
input
or
intake
of
the
material
identical.
So,
we
took
buffalo
milk,
we
took
buffalo
milk
that
milk
1.03
kg
we
had
taken.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
03:47)
And
that
contains
65.6%
moisture
and
6.3
%
fat.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
03:54)
3
(Refer
Slide
Time:
04:01)
And
its
acidity
level
at
that
moment
was
0.15.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
04:09)
We
said
earlier
that
milk
between
0.1
to
0.28.
The
milk
is
taken
best
0.1
is
the
best,
0.28
is
gradually
going
to
worse,
but
up
to
that
limit
it
can
be
accepted.
So,
here
our
acidity
level
is
4
0.15
so
it
is
a
very
reasonably
good
milk
right;
having
6.3%
fat
and
85.8
%
moisture
85.6
%
moisture
right.
So,
this
is
the
starting
side
by
side
we
have
taken
citric
acid,
citric
acid
in
the
solid
granules.
So,
citric
acid
4.67
into
10
to
the
power
minus
3
kg
per
minute
is
the
flow
rate
right
because,
this
is
a
continuous
chhana
making
process.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:15)
So,
that
is
why
per
hour
it
has
come
or
per
minute
kg
per
minute
that
is
flow
rate
has
come.
So,
it
is
this
is
mass
flow
rate
4.67x10
-3
kg/min
is
taken
as
the
granule.
And
water
is
taken
0.21
kg
per
minute
right.
So,
they
are
now
mixed
so
that
mixing
is
done.
5
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:45)
So,
after
mixing
this
makes
citric
acid
solution,
containing
0.21
kg
per
minute
solution;
because
your
water
was
there
and
the
entire
acid
is
soluble
in
the
water .
(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:00)
So,
you
got
a
total
solid
of
2.77
percent.
Then
the
entire
solution
is
heated
in
a
U-tube
heat
exchanger .
So,
U-tube
heat
exchanger
is
looking
like.
6
(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:20)
So,
you
have
U-tube
like
this.
So,
this
type
of
heat
exchanger
is
used
for
heating
right.
So,
U-tube
heat
exchanger
length
2
meter ,
tube
ID
or
OD
is
6
by
9
mm
right.
So,
that
we
prepared
or
made
in
our
lab.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:49)
And
this
side
this
is
already
ready ,
this
side
milk
has
come.
So,
what
we
are
doing?
We
are
now
heating
that
milk.
So,
your
milk
heating
is
done
in
indirect
type
of
helical
tube
right,
helical
tube
like
this
helix
right.
So,
helical
tube
is
this
way
it
is
a
helic
is
being
formed.
7
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:21)
So,
in
a
helical
tube
heat
exchanger ,
tube
length
4.96
meter
mean
diameter
of
the
coil
is
120
millimetre
tube
ID
OD
is
6
by
9
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:38)
Then
this
is
heated
by
saturated
steam
at
1.13
bar
at
103°C
right.
At
103°C
it
is
to
be
heated
so
then,
what
do
you
get?
Along
with
this,
what
do
you
get?
You
are
getting
this
hot
milk
then
this
is
cooled.
8
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:08)
So,
cooling
by
indirect
type
helical
tube
heat
exchanger
tube
length
7
meter
mean
diameter
of
the
coil
is
120
millimetre
and
tube
ID
OD
is
6
by
9
millimetre
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:31)
There
it
is
being
cooled
by
water ,
water
at
a
rate
of
1
kg
per
minute
with
temperature
of
28°C
right.
So,
you
got
this
cold
milk
and
the
temperature
of
the
milk
comes
to
70°C.
So,
you
got
70°C
milk
and
citric
acid
solution
at
a
rate
of
0.21
kg
per
minute
which
is
brought
to
70°C.
9
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:13)
Because
if
it
is
not
70
degree,
if
it
is
70
then
again
that
heat
will
be
either
exchanged
between
them,
that
is
not
desirable.
So,
both
are
at
70°C.
And
then
they
are
mixed
the
citric
acid
and
the
milk
they
are
mixed
in
a
vertical
tube,
where
the
milk
is
milk
where
milk
acid
mix
moves
upward
tube
length
is
80
centimetre,
tube
diameter
is
4.5
centimetre
and
the
residence
time
is
1
minute
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:55)
10
So,
when
we
kept
it
then
we
is
the
milk
gets
precipitated
or
a
milk
gets
curdled.
So,
there
by
gravity
separation
in
a
muslin
cloth
they
are
separated
and
we
get
that
chhana
to
the
tune
of
0.218
kg
per
minute.
This
is
minute
0.218
kg
per
minute
having
a
moisture
content
of
50
percent.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
10:40)
So,
this
is
another
thing
which
is
required
that
this
rate
is
0.218
kg
per
minute
not
in
this
is
minute.
So,
m
got
this
is
the
you
know
deleted.
So,
0.218
kg
per
minute
with
a
moisture
content
of
50.
So,
this
moisture
content
with
we
will
tell
whether
it
is
0.218
or
0.25
or
0.19.
So,
if
it
is
less
moisture
then
less
total,
it
is
more
moisture
more
total;
so,
then
that
quantity
will
be
dictated
by
the
moisture
content
right.
11
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:27)
So,
it
is
cold
and
this
is
separated
and
we
get
way
1.01
kg
per
minute
right.
So,
this
is
how
chhana
is
being
made
right.
So,
now
let
us
look
into
another
product
that
is
paneer ,
paneer
is
made
from
again
chhana
or
milk.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:59)
So,
here
we
are
taking
milk
1
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
83%
fat
content
of
7%
acidity
0.17%
lactic
acid
right,
this
is
the
starting
material.
12
(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:21)
Then
heated
to
95°C,
the
detailed
we
have
shown
in
the
previous
one
that
how
our
heat
exchangers
are
made.
So,
those
we
have
kept
now
aside,
but
the
similar
things
have
been
used.
So,
heating
is
95°C.
Then
cooled
to
70°C
and
this
side
we
have
taken
citric
acid
4.54x10
-3
kg
water
0.2
kg
and
they
are
mixed
then
heated
to
70°C.
So,
this
citric
acid
solution
and
milk
heated
milk
both
at
70°C
mixed
and
at
70°C
and
it
allowed
to
settle.
Then
milk
acid
mix
of
1.2
kg
with
an
acidity
of
0.66%
lactic
acid
is
obtained.
13
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:27)
And
we
get
its
gravity
separation
through
a
muslin
cloth
at
around
60
to
70°C.
So,
way
comes
out
around
0.953
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
94.5
percent.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:47)
And
we
get
chhana
around
0.252
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
94.5%
right.
Earlier ,
I
told
you
that
the
higher
the
moisture
content
more
will
be
the
quantity .
So,
here
also
you
see
that
0.252
kg
we
got
with
a
moisture
content
of
94%
right.
14
(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:15)
Then
it
is
centrifugally
separated,
centrifugal
pressing
by
double
wall
basket
it
is
done
and
this
centrifugation
is
done
between
30
to
60°C.
Then
we
get
whey
out
from
by
the
centrifugation
we
get
whey
out,
where
we
get
0.054
kg
of
whey ,
with
the
moisture
content
of
88.4
percent.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:39)
15
And
we
get
pressed
chhana
0.198
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
43%
then
it
is
chilled.
So,
chilling
pressed
chhana
inside
the
centrifuge
by
chilled
water
at
40°C
in
the
ratio
of
1:5.
That
is
1
part
of
to
chhana
to
5
part
of
40°C
water
for
a
time
period
of
24
minute.
And
we
get
some
milk
solids
around
0.009
kg
that
is
wasted
and
we
get
a
rather
that
is
one
which
you
get
rather
milk
solid
whether
rather
gets
wasted
when
it
is
going
out
with
the
water .
And
some
water
around
point
0.016
kg
that
is
also
coming
out,
then
we
are
while
we
are
pressing
that
water
comes
out
some
solids
comes
out
and
all
we
get
paneer
around
0.0.205
kg
with
the
moisture
content
of
49.8%
right.
So,
this
way
you
can
make
the
paneer
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:17)
Then
we
come
is
another
thing
to
another
product
called
Sandesh.
So,
this
is
a
very
popular
in
Bengal,
may
be
all
over
the
country .
Sandesh
is
one
very
popular
product
made
from
milk.
So,
Sandesh
we
are
making
milk
taking
1
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
87.9%
having
fat
4%
total
solid
12.1
and
this
is
heated
to
90°C
cool
to
70°C;
side
by
side
citric
acid
taken
3.44
in
to
10
to
the
power
minus
3
kg
with
water
up
to
0.25
kg.
16
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:50)
They
are
mixed
heated
to
90°C
then
cooled
to
70°C
citric
acid
solution
of
1.376%
and
0.25
kg
right.
And
then
they
are
mixed
for
a
minute
and
settled
at
acidity
of
0.4%
lactic
acid.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:29)
Then
they
are
separated
by
gravity ,
by
gravity
separation
we
get
whey
of
1.06
kg
having
a
moisture
content
of
92.2
percent.
17
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:47)
And
we
also
get
chhana
of
0.193
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
62
percent.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:56)
And
then
it
is
centrifuged,
centrifugal
separation
is
done
by
basket
centrifuge
at
around
1500
rpm
for
8
minute
right.
Earlier
we
did
not
mention
rpm
of
the
centrifuge,
here
we
are
mentioning
that
centrifuge
is
working
at
1500
rpm.
18
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:17)
Then
we
get
some
whey
also
out
around
0.052
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
84.6
kg.
And
we
get
the
mixing
planetary
gear
at
60
rpm
for
5
minutes
where,
this
mass
and
the
sugar
is
added
around
0.056
kg.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:45)
So,
this
sugar
is
added
to
this
solid
mass
and
mixing
in
a
planetary
gear
for
60
at
60
rpm
for
5
minutes.
Then
kneading
is
done,
only
this
kneading
is
done
no
this
was
also
done
19
automatically ,
no
manual
all
are
done
automatically
in
75
rpm
screw
kneader
right.
This
screw
kneader
also
was
developed
at
our
place.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:15)
So,
this
screw
kneader
is
kneading
so
kneading
is
one
of
the
important
step
for
making
Sandesh.
You
might
have
seen
in
the
confectionery
that
they
are
kneading
it
like
the
one
which
is
done
at
home,
when
bread
is
being
made
so
that
is
also
being
kneaded
right.
So,
this
kneading
is
done
at
75
rpm
in
a
screw
kneader .
And
this
kneaded
chhana
with
sugar
mixture
we
get
0.197
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
35.6%
right.
Then
it
is
cooked
at
75°C
for
4.6
minute
and
then
cooled
to
25°C
and
this
is
done
in
a
shaping
vented
extruder ,
shaping
vented
extruder .
The
extruder
was
like
this
and
the
top
is
opened
a
part
of
the
top
is
opened.
So,
that
is
the
shaping
vented
extruder
so,
that
the
water
for
moisture
can
easily
go
out
right.
20
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:29)
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:36)
So,
by
this
we
get
Sandesh,
and
this
Sandesh
since
we
did
not
have
because
Sandesh
generally
available
in
the
market
of
different
shape,
different
product,
but
different
variety .
But,
ours
one
was
a
cylindrical
shape
because
this
from
there
when
it
is
it
was
coming
to
a
shaping
machine
that
was
so,
only
cylindrical
in
shape.
So,
small-small
cylinders
like
this
we
got
and
the
taste
was
same
as
it
was
available
in
the
market,
but
the
shape
and
size
that
was
our
only,
that
was
our
only
drawback
that
it
could
not
be
like
the
one
which
is
available
in
the
market
because,
they
make
it
in
a
mould
by
hand.21
But
here
no
hand
was
made,
right
from
this
top
to
this
Sandesh
preparation
entire
thing
was
automatic
and
no
hand
was
put
in
between.
And,
that
is
why
when
we
got
the
shaping
we
wanted
to
give
the
shape
was
a
cylindrical
shape
and
the
taste
was
as
good
as
the
Sandesh.
And
a
storability
was
also
for
couple
of
days,
because
moisture
is
very
high
a
the
sugar
is
very
high
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:11)
So,
then
we
move
quickly
to
another
very
very
popular
one
that
is
called
rasogolla
making
right.
This
rasogolla
making
is
again
from
cow
milk
of
1
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
88.7
percent,
and
fat
content
of
0.0
point
moisture
content
88.7
percent,
fat
content
0.033.
Acidity
is
0.016
lactic
acid.
I
think
this
made
it
is
1
kg.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
made
the
3.3%
fat
content
is
3.3%
right.
22
(Refer
Slide
Time:
23:07)
So,
that
is
heated
to
95°C,
cool
to
70°C,
parallelly
citric
acid
solution
you
have
made
citric
acid
3.44
into
10
to
the
power
minus
3.
Water
0.25
mixed
heated
70
to
70°C,
got
the
citric
acid
solution
1.376
percent.
Then
they
are
mixed
and
settled
a
for
1
minute
acidity
level
is
0.4
percent.
And
you
got
the
whey
of
1.107
kg
with
a
moisture
of
95.5
percent;
this
is
done
through
gravity
separation.
And
after
separation
you
got
the
chhana.
Chhana
is
0.146%
146
kg
and
moisture
content
is
55.5%
55%
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:01)
23
Then
you
got
the
basis
that
is
the
chhana
and
this
is
kneaded
and
little
water
is
added
around
0.011kg.
So,
that
it
becomes
easy
for
kneading.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:15)
Then
kneaded
chhana
of
0.157
kg
with
your
moisture
content
of
58%
is
made
to
balls,
is
made
to
balls
and
this
balls
were
made
15
numbers
10.46
gram
each.
And
then
little
water
this
is
there
is
an
arrow
a
little
water
comes
out
during
cooking.
Cooking
is
done
in
2
litre
50%
sugar
solution
for
20
minutes
sugar
was
added
0.043
kg
and
then
you
got
cooked
chhana
balls,
0.252
kg
total
solid
0.109
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
56.6%.
24
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:54)
Then
it
is
soaked
in
1
litter
50
%sugar
solution
for
4
hour
at
30°C
right,
for
4
hour
at
30
°C.
Then
you
got
water
out
around
0.045
kg
and
you
also
got
out
a
sugar
0.016
kg
then
you
got
rasogolla
0.313
kg
right.
This
0.313
kg
rasogolla
which
you
got
that
is
very
good
in
taste
and
that
was
rather
very
good
in
taste
and
the
shape
and
size
was
also
absolutely
perfect
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:00)
Then
sweetened
pineapple
slice
very
quickly
because,
time
is
very
limited.
So,
we
pineapple
1
kg
is
taken,
then
peeling
coring
and
slicing
to
8
millimetre
thick.
Water
goes
out
0.3
kg,
25
then
dipping
in
2
%
ascorbic
acid,
then
dipping
in
62
brix
sugar
at
47
°C
for
4
hour.
Syrup
slice
in
syrup
is
to
slice
is
4
is
to
1
some
water
comes
out
around
0.398
kg.
Then
washing
in
water
open
steam
pour
is
given
right.
Then
4
minute
then
we
it
is
hot
air
drying
water
vapour
goes
out,
in
this
case
sugar
is
also
added
before
that
water
is
coming
out
0.176
kg.
So,
hot
air
drying
you
get
sweetened
pineapple
slice
0.256
kg
moisture
content
around
11
%
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:13)
And
then
last
is
shelled
cashew
nut,
that
is
roasted
cashew
nut
a
makhana
is
also
there.
So,
roasted
cashew
nut
is
prepared
roasted
cashew
nut
1
kg
shelling
by
a
plate
mill
300
rpm,
300
millimetre
diameter .
Manually
separated
shell
comes
out
0.7
kg
and
unshelled
kernel
is
30
%
feed.
And
then
cashew
kernel
0.3
kg
with
a
moisture
content
of
18.5
percent.
Then
oven
dried
80°C
for
6
hours,
dried
cashew
nut
kernel
0.26
kg.
With
a
moisture
content
of
6
percent,
then
manual
peeling
is
done.
Cashew
kernel
with
0.25
kg
having
moisture
content
of
6
%
is
been
obtained,
from
there
it
is
open
steam
is
done
made
for
4
minutes.
So,
some
rejected
one
is
0.25,
split
one
is
0.055,
and
brokens
one
are
0.068
kg,
but
whole
cashew
you
got
0.125
kg
right.
26
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:37)
So,
the
last
one
which
we
have
is
makhana
and
makhana
is
a
very
popular
in
North
Indian
dishes.
So,
what
you
make
that
from
hot
air
drying
in
tray
dryer
at
60°C
right.
Some
water
vapour
goes
out
dried
makhana
seed
with
a
moisture
content
of
0.25
moisture
content
of
25
percent.
Then
grading
by
set
of
sieves,
some
are
rejected
graded
makhana
seed
then
preheating
in
screw
type
conveyer
water
vapour
comes
out.
The
hot
makhana
seed
of
21%
is
obtained
then
it
is
tempered,
roasted
in
screw
type
roaster .
Then
popping
is
done
in
centrifugal
popping
machine
then
manually
separated
seed
coat
comes
out
then
popped
makhana
is
obtained.
And
this
is
then
graded
then
you
get
under
popped,
over
popped
and
properly
popped
makhana.
Then
that
is
polished
some
red
percorp
was
obtained
as
my
product
then
packaging
in
polyethylene
lined
gunny
wax.
And
then
this
you
get
processed
makhana
right.
So,
by
this
we
come
to
the
end.
And
one
thing
which
I
would
like
to
share
here
with
you
that,
whatever
we
have
talk
till
now,
we
have
tried
our
best.
But
please
go
through
repeatedly
and
appear
in
the
exam.
So,
this
courses
under
MOOC
is
University
approved,
MHRD
approved,
AICTE
approved,
UGC
approved.
So,
you
can
compensate
some
courses
at
your
place.
And
you
can
talk
to
your
teachers
or
head
of
the
departments
or
principal,
so
that
these
courses
if
you
appear
and
give
the
exam
get
the
certificate
that
can
compensate
your
normal
course
work
right.
So,
all
the
best
for
future,
hope
you
have
enjoyed
the
classes.
27
Thank
you.
