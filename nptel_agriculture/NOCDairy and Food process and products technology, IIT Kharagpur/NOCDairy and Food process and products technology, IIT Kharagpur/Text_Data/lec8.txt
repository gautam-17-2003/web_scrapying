Quality
of
Food
If
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
class
we
stopped
at
this
that
what
is
the
quality
term
in
food,
right?
Because,
again
this
with
this
page
you
have
to
show
because
this
is
a
part
of
that
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
right
and
we
were
discussing
that
what
is
the
quality
because
quality
is
such
a
big
word;
anywhere
it
is
not
only
in
food
anywhere
quality
is
a
such
a
big
word.
It
encompasses
many
many
things,
desirable,
undesirable
many
many
things
liking,
disliking,
requirement,
non
requirement,
law,
safe,
unsafe.
Nothing
is
beyond
the
word
quality ,
everything
come
under
quality .
If
you
go
to
buy
anything
you
will
see
same
product
people
will
say
this
is
because
of
the
quality
difference
the
product
is
different
whether
that
product
might
be
under
some
branded
name
or
may
not
be
under
branded
name,
but
still
there
may
be
difference
in
pricing.
So,
everybody
plays
with
the
term
quality ,
but
science
cannot
play
like
that
unidentified
or
without
any
definitions,
right.
So,
science
how
science
defines
food
quality
let
us
look
into
that
today ,
ok.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

So,
if
you
look
at
food
quality ,
what
is
it?
We
can
say
that
food
quality
is
the
extent
to
which
all
the
established
requirements
requiring
relating
to
the
characteristics
of
a
food
is
met,
right.
So,
you
can
give
some
examples.
For
example,
if
you
can
identify
or
identity
of
a
food
in
relation
to
standard
so,
for
a
definite
food
that
is
why
I
said
identify .
So,
if
you
identify
a
food
how
the
identity
of
that
food
is
identified
with
reference
to
a
given
standard
because
as
I
said
earlier
that
for
the
safety
of
the
food
safety
means,
safety
of
the
people
who
are
consuming,
because
controlling
agents
or
controlling
or
monitoring
departments
monitoring
personal
who
are
associated
with
this
first
the
everybody
look
into
the
safety
of
the
consumer
who
is
consuming,
right.
So,
if
consumer
is
for
that
when
you
are
identifying
the
particular
food
product
and
when
you
are
saying
that
the
identity
of
that
food
product
is
as
per
with
the
standard
given
then
you
can
call
it
to
be
a
ok,
a
quality
product.
Or,
if
the
declared
gross
or
net
quantity
in
many
cases
you
will
see
because
nowadays
it
has
become
a
mandatory
that
if
a
product
is
under
some
packaging
whatever
we
packing
within
some
four
walls
if
it
is
that
then
it
is
a
mandatory
that
it
should
get
it
should
be
written
what
is
the
net
weight
of
the
product,
right.
It
is
not
like
going
to
everyday
market
and
buying
fruits
and
vegetables
or
fish,
meat
a
poultry
like
that
if
that
is
also
under
any
prescribed
for
that
is
in
any
packing
material
then
it
should
have
the
quantity
mentioned,
right.
So,
if
the
quantity
what
is
mentioned
in
the
product
in
terms
of
either
weight
or
volume
that
is
the
quantity .
So,
which
depending
on
the
product
type
you
it
may
be
in
terms
of
in
terms
of
weight
or
it
may
be
in
terms
of
volume,
right.
So,
because
volume
and
weight
normally
both
are
not
given.
Normally ,
volume
and
weight
both
are
not
given,
but
in
typical
cases
it
could
be
right,
but
those
who
are
which
are
more
significant
in
terms
of
volume
they
will
be
given
volume
and
those
which
may
be
define
in
terms
of
weight
they
are
given
in
terms
of
weight.
So,
if
that
declared
standard
or
declared
or
claimed
quantity
is
there
then
that
could
be
another
aspect
of
the
quality
which
people
or
consumer
are
normally
worried
about
or
can
think
of
then
declared
or
claimed
amount
of
one
or
more
stated
components
of
a
food,
right.
Stated
components
means
in
many
cases
you
will
see
that
the
product
is
on
the
on
the
packaging
it
is
written
that
this
contains
this
materials,
right.
So,
if
it
is
mentioned
there
that
2is
declared
or
claimed
and
if
it
is
there
then
it
is
ok,
but
it
is
not
there
then
definitely
you
can
challenge
or
any
consumer
can
challenge
and
that
will
deviate
from
the
term
quality ,
right.
Now ,
as
of
now
we
are
telling
one
or
two
measurable
quantity
like
weight
or
volume,
right
or
the
date
of
manufacture
date
of
expiry .
So,
this
things
comes
under
also
the
safety
regulations
date
of
expiry
date
of
manufacture
then
batch
number .
So,
that
the
typical
product
can
be
identified
of
course,
that
comes
under
law
will
discuss
when
we
are
going
into
law
as
I
said
when
we
are
discussing
law.
Obviously ,
this
laws
are
food
laws
are
such,
yes,
they
are
stringent,
but
definitely
as
far
as
students
are
concerned
that
the
time
of
classes
like
this
it
will
not
be
so
palatable
because
mostly
informative
and
all
this
informationâ€™ s
are
either
supposed
to
be
kept
in
mind
or
noted
down
somewhere.
So,
that
as
and
when
required
you
can
you
can
refer
it
or
you
can
negotiate
with
that,
but
here
we
need
to
know
some
parameters
by
which
we
can
say
quality
in
more
precise
form
in
a
scientific
way,
right.
So,
for
that
we
need
to
know
some
parameters
which
we
can
tell
that
ok,
quality
could
be
any
or
all
of
them
so,
it
is
not
necessarily
all
of
them
have
to
be
there.
So,
that
is
why
some
or
all
or
any
of
them
may
or
may
not
be
sufficient
for
the
for
the
definition
of
the
quality
of
defining
a
quality
product
quality
food
material,
where
I
am
saying
one
as
we
said
in
many
cases
the
only
weight
is
available
right;
may
be
there
the
weight
is
the
fundamental
thing
rest
of
the
things
are
all
obvious.
So,
they
are
the
only
that
parameter
could
be
you
good
enough.
So,
in
that
comes
under
this
that
we
say
that
appearance
right
for
example,
size
shape
or
color
right,
that
is
one
parameter
which
can
be
measured
because
you
can
measure
size
you
can
also
measure
or
tell
what
is
the
shape
like
whether
it
is
regular
pattern
like
rectangular
or
square
that
is
in
Cartesian
coordinates
or
in
cylindrical
coordinate
that
is
in
cylinder
form
or
cylindrical
form
or
in
spherical
coordinate
in
spherical
form.
If
that
shape
is
also
defined
or
it
may
be
also
that
there
is
not
defined
shape,
right.
It
is
not
necessarily
that
the
product
has
to
be
a
defined
shape
or
it
should
have
defined
shape,
right,
but
if
there
then
identifying
is
easier
then
you
can
tell
that
their
product
was
of
this
shape
and
it
is
size
was
this
may
be
shape
it
is
a
cylindrical,
diameter
is
so
much
and
height
is
so
much.
3So,
we
can
you
can
say
that
the
product
is
like
that
right
colour
in
terms
of
appearance
colour
could
be
that
that
particular
product
could
be
yellow
colour ,
may
be
red
colour
or
a
mixture
of
colours.
So,
depending
on
that,
but
it
is
measurable,
right.
So,
parameters
which
you
can
measure
based
on
that
the
quality
terms
can
be
set,
right.
Then
flavor ,
flavour
and
aroma.
Now ,
in
many
cases
if
you
if
you
see
the
English
meaning
of
flavor
and
aroma
that
has
one
type
right.
But
in
typical
in
engineering
and
science
base
then
you
we
can
differentiate.
Now ,
aroma
is
that
odor
which
normally
you
perceive
through
the
nose.
We
may
be
we
may
be
coming
after
sometime
in
definite
definition
that
what
could
be
aroma
and
what
could
be
the
flavor .
But
for
a
common
mans
difference
you
can
say
odour
is
by
the
volatile
components
and
it
is
it
is
through
the
nasal
part
which
by
which
you
can
identify
or
you
can
detect,
right.
From
the
aroma
of
the
mango
which
is
kept
may
be
10
feet
away
from
there
you
can
say
that
it
is
a
mango,
right.
But,
when
it
comes
to
flavor
it
all
in
combination
it
is
not
a
single
only
smell
only
that
will
not
be
good
enough
to
tell
the
flavor .
Flavor
it
is
mixture
of
taste
then
it
is
how
because
taste
also
will
vary
because
something
can
be
salty,
something
can
be
soury ,
something
can
be
sweety
or
like
that.
So,
depending
on
what
type
of
taste
it
is
having
what
kind
of
flavor
what
kind
of
aroma
it
is
having;
what
kind
of
all
put
together
it
comes
under
the
umbrella
of
flavor .
So,
we
will
define
it
definitely
in
a
more
precise
way.
Then
comes
texture,
right.
In
the
term
texture;
obviously ,
there
are
many
many
parameters
which
and
texture;
obviously ,
food
texture
is
quite
different
from
many
other
textures,
right.
That
is
why
you
will
see
texture
is
normally
the
measured
by
some
Universal
Testing
Machine
or
UTM,
right;
which
normally
texture
is
measured.
So,
normally
by
that
texture
is
measured,
but
the
concept
of
this
make
texture
this
came
up
with
because
whatever
as
we
said
in
the
beginning
in
the
previous
in
the
very
early
classes
that
food
we
normally
say
that
substance
which
we
consume
by
mouth,
right.
So,
when
we
are
consuming
by
mouth
what
you
have
it
is
put
into
your
mouth
cavity
and
you
have
the
teeth,
right.
So,
this
teeth
what
it
is
doing
it
is
crushing
or
it
is
grinding
and
as
well
it
is
coming
some
when
you
are
you
are
chewing
it
some
chewing,
some
gummy ,
some
cohesive
all
these
things
come
into
your
mouth
feel
right
and
these
mouth
feel
has
been
4translated
to
this
UTM.
Normally
UTM
if
those
universal
testing
machines
there
are
many
varieties
many
varieties
means
if
you
will
go
to
the
UTM
section
then
you
will
see
lot
of
companies
have
made
this
UTM,
but
for
our
food
there
a
small
units
of
by
which
that
we
call
texture
analyzer ,
right.
Basically ,
it
is
a
force
deformation
card
which
you
also
will
come
subsequently .
So,
this
force
deformation
card
when
you
are
obtaining
from
a
machine
you
can
definitely
tell
on
the
scientific
parameters
basis
that
its
texture
is
like
this.
So,
you
can
tell
the
quality
of
the
material
in
terms
of
texture
was
this
and
that
right,
judging
you
can
do.
So,
quality
then
has
to
be
defined
in
terms
of
judging
parameters
some
parameters
by
which
you
can
judge
that
particular
product
right.
So,
we
have
already
said
that
the
appearance
in
that
shape
size
colour
they
are
coming
in
flavor
arome
they
are
also
coming
in
the
another
category
then
texture
is
coming
in
another
category .
Some
other
more
scientific
terms;
of
course,
generally
it
commonly
it
is
very
difficult
because
I
do
not
say
that
the
texture
or
flavor
also
it
is
very
easy
for
people
to
do,
but
yes
there
are
some
taste
called
organoleptic
test,
right
by
which
when
you
are
consuming
what
is
the
perception
of
the
consumer
who
is
consuming
that
typical
product
in
terms
of
his
appearance,
in
terms
of
his
flavor
colour
or
texture
then
that
can
be.
But
when
you
are
measuring
with
respect
to
something
in
terms
of
machine
scientific
machineries
then
you
are
more
and
that
was
in
terms
of
person;
I
am
consuming
one
I
may
have
liking
your
feeling
for
something
if
somebody
else
is
consuming
another
are
the
same
we
may
have
or
may
not
have
the
similar
liking
or
feeling
like
that.
So,
the
distinction
could
be
based
on
some
either
biasness
or
whatever
it
be
may
might
not
be
identical,
but
when
you
are
saying
in
terms
of
machine
right
that
appearance
sides
in
terms
of
colours
size
all
these
you
are
measuring
in
terms
of
flavor
aroma
you
are
measuring
in
terms
of
texture
you
are
measuring.
So,
the
parameters
which
you
are
saying,
is
of
course,
based
on
the
typical
measuring
parameter
and
there
it
is
having
the
repeatability ,
right.
In
organoleptic
test
when
we
do
there
it
may
or
may
not
have
the
same
repeatability;
but,
in
terms
of
machine
yes
your
repeatability
should
we
have
identical
right.
So,
that
is
more
more
dependable
parameter
than
even
the
5organoleptic
test,
but
obviously ,
organoleptic
cannot
be
kept
aside
because
ultimately
it
is
people
who
are
consuming.
So,
their
version
whether
it
may
be
identical
or
may
not
be
right
that
is
why
more
when
a
new
material
is
being
brought
to
the
market
then
this
organoleptic
test
is
done
for
wide
variation
right
wide
variety
of
people
are
being
called
and
then
their
other
than
machine
parameters.
There
are
asked
to
give
based
on
different
hydronic
scale:
9
point
hydronic
scale
and
5
point
hydronic
scale
out
of
which
center
will
be
the
min
medium
and
the
maximum
will
be
on
the
top
or
minimum
will
be
on
the
bottom,
right.
So,
you
can
you
can
you
can
do
scaling
based
on
that
and
based
on
the
number
of
observers
how
many
people
are
taking.
So,
you
can
have
a
most
statistically
more
more
valid
parameter
for
that
right.
So,
that
cannot
be
also
kept
aside.
So,
when
we
are
talking
quality
this
also
to
keep
in
mind
that
organoleptic
test
that
how
it
is.
So,
other
than
that
as
you
have
said
some
other
scientific
parameters
like
viscosity
right,
like
viscosity .
So,
when
we
come
to
that
viscosity
definitely
you
have
many
many
instruments
by
which
viscosity
generally
it
is
associated
with
liquid
food
or
semi
liquid
foods,
right.
Obviously ,
the
solids
do
not
have
viscosity .
So,
viscous
fluid
means
either
it
is
a
liquid
or
a
semi
liquid
food
whose
viscosity
may
be
known.
Now ,
how
it
may
help
you
that
for
a
given
consistency
that
product
will
have
a
viscosity
which
you
can
measure
through
the
instrument,
right;
which
through
organoleptic
test
means
by
taking
it
with
your
mouth
filling
you
may
not
be
able
to
judge.
So,
that
is
more
inherit
quality
parameter
then
external
or
outer
peripheral
parameters,
right.
So,
viscosity
if
that
can
be
measured
then
with
whatever
today
also
the
same
product
will
have
one
viscosity ,
after
one
year
the
same
product
should
have
the
same
viscosity
if
the
quality
of
product
is
not
getting
changed,
right.
So,
that
can
be
another
measurable
parameter .
Then
shelf
life
or
stability
of
the
product
as
we
said
in
the
beginning
of
this
class
that
in
most
of
the
products
nowadays
it
is
written
clearly
on
the
periphery
of
the
on
the
packaging
of
the
product
that
what
is
the
date
of
manufacture
and
what
is
the
expected
date
of
expiry
right
expected
date
of
expiry
that
is
also
written.
6Now ,
obviously ,
for
as
a
consumer
you
would
like
to
have
the
more
this
shelf
life
the
more
good
or
better
for
you
because
you
have
bought
today
if
that
expiry
is
for
7
days
then
after
10
days
you
cannot
consume.
You
have
to
throw
it
out,
right
and
then
as
a
consumer
you
would
like
to
have
more
and
more
shelf
life
and
more
and
more
stable
product,
right.
So,
that
could
be
another
parameter
by
which
you
can
differentiate
or
detect
the
quality .
Then,
witness
for
use
as
human
food,
right
whether
that
particular
food
is
fit
for
the
human
being
to
consume
or
not.
Nowadays,
if
you
go
to
different
markets
then
you
see
there
are
many
such
this
is
for
human
consumption
that
is
one
side
that
is
for
some
animals
that
is
another
side
that
is
for
some
your
pets
that
is
another
side,
right.
So,
that
also
should
be
definitely
seen
that
the
fitness
of
the
product
for
consumption
of
the
human
being
right
whether
the
product
developed
or
product
being
brought
into
the
market
is
fit
for
consumption
of
the
human
being
or
not
right
something
which
may
be
very
good
otherwise,
but
it
is
appearance
does
not
allow
you
to
take
it.
May
be
there
are
many
such
things
which
we
come
across,
right,
maybe
it
is
appearance
is
very
bad
or
it
is
not
so
good
in
looking
or
it
may
not
have
any
appealing
appearance
then
you
will
definitely
would
like
to
avoid
no
I
can
avoid
this,
right.
So,
that
comes
that
fitness
that
how
fit
it
is
for
the
consumption
of
the
human
being
right.
Then,
wholesomeness:
wholesomeness
means
you
are
taking
a
product
right
and
that
product
say
milk
that
is
one
of
the
best
example
milk
you
are
taking
right
milk
as
though
(I
will
come
more
in
detail
in
subsequent
classes)
is
said
to
be
a
almost
complete
food,
but
it
is
not
a
complete
food
there
is
reason
for
that.
So,
as
a
whole
when
you
are
consuming
a
milk
you
can
say
the
wholesomeness
of
the
food
that
this
is
a
food
which
if
you
consume
will
try
to
try
to
supplement
as
much
you
require
or
as
much
as
far
as
nutrition
or
other
things
are
required
may
be
like
that.
Like
like
ice
cream
right
that
is
also
concentrated
nutrient
where
you
have
where
you
have
both
fat,
protein,
carbohydrates
this
things
together
right
and
not
only
fat,
protein
carbohydrates,
but
also
you
can
add
supplement
fortify
vitamins
and
all
that
is
right.
Then
it
comes
adulteration,
right.
You
definitely
do
not
like
to
have
products
which
are
adulterated,
right.
Everybody
would
like
to
have
natural
products,
no
artificial
even
if
it
be
7artificial,
but
there
should
not
be
any
adulteration;
means
saying
one
thing
and
giving
another
thing
that
is
adulteration.
Whatever
I
declared
whatever
I
say
if
the
product
does
not
incorporated
with
that
constituent
parts
then
we
can
say
it
is
not
as
per
with
the
defined
or
claimed
substances,
it
is
adulterated.
Milk
is
a
another
very
good
example
right.
So,
in
most
of
the
cases
you
have
seen
or
you
know
you
might
have
come
across
that
milk
the
most
adulteration
or
easiest
adulteration
is
the
by
adding
water ,
right.
In
majority
of
the
cases
this
is
major
problem
of
adulteration
that
the
addition
of
water
from
and
this
water
might
not
be
potable
water
means
drinking
water .
So,
because
the
people
who
are
doing
they
may
not
may
or
may
not
come
to
know
or
may
or
may
not
be
knowledgeable
enough
to
decide
whether
water
should
be
added
water
should
be
added
means
that
particular
water
should
be
added
or
not.
In
obviously ,
this
is
with
the
intention
of
bad
kind
of
I
mean
business
or
bad
is
social
impact
is
very
very
otherwise,
right,
it
is
not
good,
but
that
is
that
can
be
considered
adulterated.
Of
course,
nowadays
milk
is
available
were
none
of
the
milk
material
milk
constituents
are
there,
but
still
they
are
called
to
be
milk
or
is
being
sold
in
terms
of
milk,
right.
So,
that
is
were
adulteration
is
coming
in
picture
right
and
in
many
cases
you
will
see
that
people
are
adding
either
stone
or
this
or
that
may
be
with
rice
or
dal
or
any
other ,
right.
So,
they
are
then
can
be
said
to
be
adulterated
not
differently
required
as
far
as
consumption
or
consumer
is
concerned,
right.
Then,
packaging;
Nowadays,
packaging
industry
has
become
so
worst
right
packaging
industry
has
become
so
worst
that
it
is
also
coming
under
that
not
directly
under
the
food
quality
because
that
is
different
food
is
inside
packaging
is
outside
of
that
food,
but
package
nowadays
packaging
industry
has
become
so
developed
that
in
many
cases
people
are
being
I
do
not
say
being
fooled
or
at
least
at
least
can
be
said
that
people
are
being
mesmerized
to
the
advertisement
of
the
packaging,
right.
So,
that
packaging
is
also
an
important
parameter ,
but
not
directly
related
to
the
quality
because
it
is
not
associated
with
the
food
quality .
But,
that
packaging
material
can
in
turn
be
a
part
of
the
quality
determination
of
the
food
because
if
the
packaging
is
not
good
that
may
in
inculcate
some
external
contamination
or
some
kind
of
humiliation
with
the
with
the
unwanted
things.
So,
these
things
are
definitely
8part
of
the
quality ,
but
as
such
package
itself
is
not.
So,
how
far
it
is
affecting
on
the
quality
that
part
is
coming
into
the
quality
term
of
the
food.
Then,
in
this
the
last
parameter
we
can
say
labeling,
right.
So,
this
labeling
is
of
course,
important
might
or
might
not
be
direct
or
indirectly
associated
with
the
quality
term
of
the
food.
Directly
how?
If
labeling
is
saying
that
date
of
manufacture
is
so
much
and
the
expiry
is
so
much
then
that
should
come
under
the
labeling
of
product
it
should
also
contain
that
this
product
contains
this
in
terms
of
in
many
products
may
be
saying
in
terms
of
carbohydrate,
in
terms
of
fat,
in
terms
of
protein.
In
many
products
maybe
they
highlight
maybe
this
part
of
the
protein
or
this
part
of
the
cur
fat
or
this
part
of
the
carbohydrate
is
used
in
the
product.
So,
labeling
is
also
a
must
and
that
comes
under
the
umbrella
of
quality
because
you
are
declaring
the
moment
that
labeling
is
there;
that
means,
the
producer
is
declaring
and
the
consumer
can
obviously ,
take
that
either
as
a
confirm
thing
or
can
also
compare
or
can
also
verify
whether
the
claim
things
are
there
or
not
right.
So,
as
such
all
these
parameter
will
tell
about
the
quality
of
the
food
material.
In
the
next
class
we
will
discuss
some
more
of
it.
So,
that
in
particular
as
you
said
that
flavor
texture,
odour
all
this
terms
we
can
discuss
little
bit
more,
ok.
Thank
you.
