What
is
Food
and
Nutrients
So,
after
the
preamble
now
we
have
to
come
to
the
main
course,
this
is
the
every
class
at
the
beginning
we
will
show
you
what
is
the
course
title
and
where
from
it
is
being
offered
and
who
is
offering,
this
comes
under
this
first
slide
right.
So,
here
you
see
this
is
after
the
preamble;
now
we
come
to
the
regular
class.
So,
our
topic
or
the
subject
is
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology .
We
have
given
in
the
preamble,
what
we
will
be
covering
how
we
will
be
following
and
what
benefit
we
will
be
getting.
So,
we
now
go
to
that
right.
One
more
thing
let
me
also
share
with
you
that,
this
year
our
recording
system
has
a
little
change.
So,
nowadays
we
are
using
it
a
commercial
thing
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:20)
we
are
using
a
very
sophisticated
instrument
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:28)
And,
I
been
all
that
much
older
than
you
can
navigate,
you
can
negotiate
at
your
age,
you
can
handle
not
only
that
you
can
also
do
things
much
quicker
faster
than
ours.
So,
I
may
land
up
sometimes
in
some
problem.
So,
that
time
I
will
ask
excuse
from
you
so,
that
the
necessary
management
or
necessary
changes
can
be
made.
However ,
I
will
try
my
best
not
to
land
up
with
any
such
problem,
but
this
is
in
the
beginning,
I
have
shared
with
you
right.
Because
everything
will
has
or
other
has
been
made
much
friendly
to
you,
this
is
not
for
us
this
is
for
you.
So,
that
you
face
very
minimum
problem,
when
you
are
going
through
the
course
repeatedly
maybe
through
the
through
the
videos,
then
the
video
should
be
very
friendly
and
acceptable
to
you.
To
for
that
this
kind
of
again
integration
of
the
new
technologies,
our
institute
or
our
system
has
brought
in
right.
After
the
preamble
now
let
us
come
to
the
level
that
what
is
food.
Now ,
the
first
question
comes
what
is
food
right.
I
personally
define
of
course,
in
all
books
also
we
will
find
in
a
in
a
same;
may
not
be
the
same
language;
if
everybody
will
tell
right,
but
the
meaning
is
same
that
whatever
you
take
through
your
mouth,
normally
right.
I
am
not
saying
abnormally
somebody
is
sick.
So,
that
time
his/her
food
is
given
through
some
nerve
or
through
some
injection.
So,
those
things
are
different;
those
are
not
normal.
So,
normal
things
are
what
do
you
take
through
your
mouth
or
for
the
betterment
of
you
or
the
nourishment
of
you
or
the
maintenance
of
your
body ,
for
the
up
scaling,
upgrading
yourself,
which
will
help
assist
you,
is
can
be
said
to
be
a
food.
Normally ,
people
are
which
is
a
plenty
available
in
the
nature
one
is
plenty
available
air,
free,
plenty
available
and
another
is
also
as
of
now
free
plenty
available
water
right.
So,
air
of
course,
you
never
take
as
a
food,
but
you
take
for
someone
some
other
thing
like
you
take
it
for
your
respiration
right.
Air
is
the
respiration
side
basic
component;
unless
air
is
there,
you
cannot
respire
right.
In
that
also
when
you
are
doing
respiration
if
you
come
into
that,
you
will
see
there
also
food
has
a
direct
role.
Because
in
the
respiration
it
is
not
the
air
only
if
you
take,
then
you
can
respire
and
you
can
sustain
you
can
survive.
It
is
not
because
air
is
one
component
in
that
respiration,
other
component
comes
from
the
food
because
in
the
respiration
what
we
get?
We
take
air
we
get
from
our
body
through
mechanism
the
basic
of
the
respiration
that
is
the
glucose.
So,
glucose
is
the
basic
of
the
respiration
cycle,
and
then
this
glucose
is
converted
into
carbon
dioxide,
water
and
energy.
So,
we
get
sufficient
energy
through
respiration.
And
that
is
where
glucose
is
the
primary ,
glucose
is
the
primary
food
which
you
have
taken.
You
might
not
have
taken
directly
glucose,
but
your
body
system
has
made
glucose
available
for
the
respiration
cycle
so,
that
that
is
never
disturbed.
I
often
tell
my
students
that
nowadays
everything
is
so
much
the
whole
world
is
in
your
hand,
because
you
have
you
have
you
have
laptop
as
well
these
palm
top
and
smart
phones
etcetera.
So,
the
entire
world
is
in
with
you
perhaps.
So,
if
you
have
seen
that
in
many
cases;
in
different
channels
TV
channels,
these
are
coming
that
people
are
stuck
in
may
be
at
high
altitude
or
maybe
at
very
remote
place,
there
is
no
supply
of
food
no
supply
of
water
nothing,
but
still
they
survive
right.
So,
though
these
are
out
of
our
syllabus,
but
this
is
a
common
knowledge
commonsense
that
we
must
know .
It
is
also
indirectly
coming
this
is
also
indirectly
coming
how
it
is
indirectly
coming?
That
you
are
stuck
may
be
say
high
altitude
around
Kanchenjunga
at
that
way
very
high
altitude
right.
For
some
reason
you
are
a
mountaineer
and
there
you
have
no
food
with
you
no
people
surrounding
you,
no
food
no
water
nothing,
but
still
may
be
after
seventeen
days
if
the
rescuer
finds
you
may
be
alive.
In
many
cases
it
has
happened
you
all
know ,
how
they
could
survive
for
such
long
because
when
it
was
required,
your
body
system
used
to
utilize
because
we
will
come
that
basicnutrients,
what
are
the
basic
nutrients
required
by
the
body?
right.
So,
those
basic
nutrients
were
supplied
by
your
body
that
is
why
you
could
have
survived
for
such
a
long
right.
So,
coming
back
to
that
original,
what
is
food
we
say
that
anything,
which
you
are
taking
through
your
mouth
as
for
the
purpose
of
the
benefit
of
yourself,
your
body ,
your
mind,
your
entire
thing,
growth,
for
your
growth,
for
your
sustainability ,
for
any
and
every
cause
you
are
taking
something
which
is
directly
or
indirectly
helping
to
sustain
to
maintain
to
improve
to
generate
energy
everything
that
is
termed
as
food
right.
So,
that
is
what
here
we
have
said
that,
one
of
the
three
basic
requirements
of
mankind
is
that
food
right
and
this
is
the
source
power
of
entire
your
system
right.
So,
what
does
it
do?
We
have
already
said;
it
is
the
source
of
nutrients
and
provides
the
energy
required
for
all
activities
for
example,
growth,
repair
of
the
damage
tissues,
reproduction,
and
sustenance
etcetera
whatever
you
can
name
right.
Anything
that
is
required
is
called
is
called
your
food
that
is
required
for
the
sustenance,
for
the
maintenance
of
your
body ,
that
product
which
helps
it
is
known
as
food
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
10:45)
Then
availability
right;
if
you
are
aware
the
world
situation,
you
will
see
that
there
are
many
people
who
are
taking
exotic
foods,
luxury
foods
days
in
day
outs.
But
there
are
also
a
good
number
of
people,
who
are
not
being
able
to
even
take
single
meal
a
day,
so,
such
wide
variation
is
there
in
the
whole
world,
it
is
really
pathetic
that
one
is
enjoying
to
the
fullest
and
the
other
is
suffering
again
to
the
bottom
part
of
the
life.
So,
these
discrepancy
should
be
minimized
who
can
do?
You
as
food
scientist
food
technologist
or
food
engineer
whatever
you
call
it
to
be,
because
I
am
telling
food
that
after
it
has
come
from
the
field
you
are
handling
that,
and
that
comes
under
agriculture
that
production
of
the
food
that
comes
under
agriculture
that
is
not
under
your
purview .
Your
purview
starts
from
the
point
when
it
is
harvested,
that
is
why
it
is
associated
with
the
name
of
post-harvest
right
this
can
be
with
respect
to
plant
origin,
with
respect
to
animal
origin
whatever
it
be
right.
In
animal
origin
if
it
is
then
we
got
it
to
be
slaughtered
or
it
can
be
chopped
or
cut
like
fish
you
cut,
you
do
slaughtering
of
the
animals
for
meat
right
similarly
poultry
eggs,
all
these
hens
these
all
are
under
the
post-harvest
during
its
rearing
or
during
its
growth
that
does
not
come
under
your
purview .
So,
when
you
are
getting
it,
that
time
you
must
be
knowing
that
the
availability
of
the
food
all
over
the
world
is
not
uniform,
somewhere
exotic
foods
are
available
somewhere
basic
requirement
is
also
not
available
right.
So,
availability
is
the
fundamental
question
all
over
the
world
as
a
food
scientist
or
again
engineer
if
you
are
coming
across
try
to
make
it
uniform
so,
that
people
all
over
the
world
do
you
have
minimum
requirement
of
the
food
why?
Because
if
somebody
is
getting
access,
somebody
is
not
getting
at
all
then
the
discrepancy
comes
here
that
the
basic
nutrients
because
we
are
all
living
being.
So,
we
need
all
the
time
some
energy,
some
food
material
as
the
intake
right
that
is
what
we
are
consuming
and
that
is
giving
us
the
livelihood
for
surviving
right.
So,
what
are
those?
So,
they
are
called
in
a
one
term
nutrients.
So,
there
are
six
basic
nutrients
right
one
is
fat,
second
is
protein,
third
is
carbohydrates,
fourth
is
vitamins,
fifth
is
minerals
and
sixth
which
we
are
saying
that
is,
you
can
also
club
vitamin
and
minerals
together ,
but
sixth
which
we
do
not
give
the
due
in
acknowledgement
that
that
is
the
water .
In
your
body
system
also
you
will
see
the
majority
is
the
water
and
when
you
come
across
with
a
any
food
any
living
thing
like
that,
we
will
see
that
normally
their
range
is
around
60
to
80
%
or
90
%
is
the
water
and
rest
of
the
things
are
other
things.
So,
water
has
a
very
high
role
in
maintaining
your
body ,
in
improving
your
body ,
in
your
growth,
in
your
sustenance,
everywhere
water
is
a
playing
a
very
vital
role.
Either
you
aretaking
directly
as
liquid
water
or
you
might
be
taking
through
some
other
sources
as
we
have
mentioned
as
a
food.
Food
also
give
you
some
water ,
but
still
you
need
to
supplement
that
by
the
body
requirement
according
to
the
body
requirement
some
quantity
from
the
external
source
other
than
food.
So,
the
basic
nutrients
are
six
types
carbohydrate,
fat,
protein,
minerals,
vitamins
and
water
right.
So,
these
are
six
basic
nutrients
which
are
required
by
the
body ,
that
is
why
that
food
should
be
available
to
everybody
for
is
or
are
living
or
sustenance
right.
Exotic
food
is
fine;
some
people
may
enjoy ,
many
people
may
enjoy
if
everybody
all
over
the
world
could
get
as
exotic
food
nothing
like
that,
but
the
disparity
is
so
much
that
in
one
end
one
end
we
are
getting
exotic
food,
we
can
afford
to
buy
and
other
end
some
people
cannot
afford
to
buy
availabilities
is
also
not
there
both
are
true
and
they
are
really
struggling.
So,
these
disparity
should
not
be
there
it
should
be
as
minimum
as
possible
right.
And
I
do
not
think
we
will
give
lecture
on
this
because
this
is
not
the
class
for
that,
but
at
least
awareness
should
be
there
that
yes
it
is
mainly
distributed
throughout
the
world.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:28)
Then
comes
what
does
these
nutrients
do
right.
So,
let
us
take
some
example
of
different
types
of
foods,
where
all
these
nutrients
are
present.
See
if
we
take
100
grams
of
food
say
in
one
case
milk
and
in
other
case
bread
right.
In
one
case
milk
and
in
other
case
bread
if
we
take,
then
in
milk
we
get
water
around
87
to
88
percent
roughly
because
again
milk
is
a
when
we
will
go
to
the
milk
itself,
then
we
will
see
that
there
are
many
factors
which
are
responsible
whether
it
will
be
87,
88,
90
or
85%.
So,
it
is
having
wide
variety .
But
this
is
an
representative
number
right.
So,
you
can
have.
So,
when
it
87,
88,
you
have
the
mind
it
will
have
85,
90
%it
is
not
15,
20
%
right.
So,
that
is
why
representative
sample
number
is
given
as
87,
88
to
water .
Carbohydrate
around
4.5
to
4.9
%
somewhat;
that
means,
carbohydrate
is
around
say
4
to
4.9,
fat
around
3.3
to
3.8/100
g
edible
milk
right.
Milk
is
entirely
edible.
So,
there
is
nothing
that
this
part
is
edible
and
this
part
is
not
edible.
So,
around
that,
protein
it
is
around
3.5,
vitamin
&
minerals
around
0.1g
right.
If
we
take
these
as
one
and
half
the
basic
components
of
the
nutrients
available
in
one
of
the
foods
like
say
milk,
the
other
one
which
also
you
take
a
everyday
almost
that
is
the
bread
another
example
I
am
giving.
That
is
bread
it
contains
40
%
water .
Again
some
bread
may
contain
45,
some
bread
may
content
35
right.
So,
we
are
not
going
into
that
dispute.
It
is
again
representative
sample
right
it
tells
that
bread
has
around
40
%
if
somebody
ask
you
will
not
say
bread
is
90
%
like
milk
right
or
milk
is
40
percent
like
bread.
So,
that
is
this
distinction
to
make
I
have
given
this
more
or
less
two
extreme,
I
am
not
saying
they
are
absolutely
extreme,
but
two
almost
different
poles
there.
So,
milk
around
85
to
90
%
bread
around
40
%
water
moisture
is
there.
The
role
of
moisture
will
come
afterwards
subsequently
so,
that
is
different,
but
it
is
like
that
ok.
Then
carbohydrate
around
50%,
fat
around
2%,
protein
1%
and
vitamins
and
minerals
1%
right.
In
milk
is
towards
1
gram
in
per
100
gram
whereas,
in
bread
it
is
one
gram
I
mean
10
times,
then
that
milk
protein
it
was
3.5
%,
here
it
is
one
in
bread
a
fat
it
was
around
3.5
%,
here
it
is
2
%.
Carbohydrate
is
around
4.5
%
in
milk,
here
it
is
around
50
%
right
and
rest
is
water .
So,
40
%
is
around
water
then
the
question
comes
when
this
kind
of
discrepancy ,
then
that
is
why
nowadays
you
have
come
across
with
one
word
many
people
have
been
saying
and
one
more
thing
as
food
what
I
said
in
the
preamble,
here
also
suddenly
it
came
to
my
mind
before
and
manage
to
forget.Let
me
also
tell
this
that
nowadays
I
said
those
by
which
we
take
through
mouth
those
things
for
our
vitamin,
nowadays
if
people
are
becoming
so
much
I
do
not
say
that
sick
or
ill
or
something
like
that
at
least,
the
urban
places
people
are
suffering
a
lot
then
definitely
in
the
rural.
So,
what
doctors
do
tell
that
do
not
take
medicine
as
in
the
name
of
medicine,
because
urban
people
they
have
lot
of
thought
or
lot
of
thinking
or
lot
of
work
or
lot
of
many
other
things.
So,
this
will
unnecessarily
put
up
into
stress.
So,
to
avoid
that
stress,
doctors
also
do
tell
that
please
do
not
take
your
medicine,
if
it
is
more
in
number
say
somebody
is
taking
maybe
a
day
8
to10
medicines
a
day.
So,
he
will
think
I
am
surviving
on
the
medicine
no;
doctors
were
saying
that
you
take
this
medicines
as
food,
you
take
this
medicine
as
food
because
then
the
food
which
you
are
taking
ok
the
milk
has
one
name,
bread
has
another
name
this
is
also
this
capsule
that
tablet
that
is
also
another .
So,
you
take
in
that
spirit,
then
you
will
not
be
under
stress
that
you
are
taking
milk
you
are
taking
medicine
you
are
sustaining
on
medicine
right.
So,
I
again
corroborate
that,
those
which
we
take
for
our
betterment
for
maintenance
is
the
food.
So,
we
have
come
that
there
are
six
basic
nutrients.
That
are
fat
protein,
carbohydrate,
minerals,
vitamins,
and
water ,
and
we
have
given
two
examples
one
with
bread
and
another
with
milk,
showing
wide
variety .
Sometimes
ok
what
does
these
do
then
also
this
question
we
came
right
ok.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:44)
Will
come
to
that,
I
said
earlier
that
if
it
is
solid
food,
not
the
liquid
then
we
have
two
origins.
One
is
plant
origin
another
is
animal
origin.
If
it
is
from
plant
origin
then
they
come
under
the
umbrella
of
cereals
like
rice,
wheat,
corn,
etcetera
some
legumes
like
soybeans
and
many
others,
some
nuts
like
high
fat
cashew
nut
or
high
protein
almonds,
high
carbohydrate
chest
nuts,
these
are
available.
Roots
and
tubers
they
are
under
the
family
of
plant
origin.
So,
normal
we
do
consume
carrots,
beets,
radish,
potato,
these
are
under
the
roots
and
tubers
vegetables
may
be
cabbage,
onion,
cauliflower
many
others
do
take
we
do
take
fruits
many
be
banana,
orange,
apple
all
these
are
under
the
kingdom
of
animal
origin.
Then
comes
the
other
and
by
and
large
yeah
by
and
large
in
our
country ,
we
do
call
these
to
be
under
the
umbrella
of
vegetarian
right.
Any
product
any
food
we
made
out
of
these
we
call
it
to
be
vegetarian
food
or
veg
right.
So,
the
other
category
non
vegetarian
that
comes
under
the
umbrella
of
plant
animal
origin
right;
obviously ,
if
it
is
animal
origin
then
it
comes
under
the
umbrella
of
meat,
meat
may
be
beef
meat,
pork
or
lamb,
any
such
chicken
all
these
come
under
the
meat.
Then
fish
and
when
we
are
talking
about
fish,
one
thing
also
you
should
know
though
this
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
class,
but
as
a
information
that.
Fish
is
much
better
much
assimilable,
then
corresponding
meat.
Because
of
many
factor
because
of
many
reasons
right
fish
is
more
this
much
at
least
you
must
know
that,
fish
is
more
assimilable
in
the
body
of
man,
than
that
in
the
body
from
the
meat
right.
A
because
all
over
the
world
there
are
all
together
different
types
of
people
right
everybody
has
different
constitution
different
to
nature
etcetera.
So,
the
habit
food
habit
cannot
be
identified
cannot
be
identical
also.
But
even
then
it
has
been
observed
by
the
scientist
that
if
it
is
from
the
fish
origin,
then
it
is
much
more
assimilable
than
that
in
the
in
the
in
the
meat
from
the
meat
itself
right.
So,
in
the
fish
again
there
are
two
varieties
like
fatty
fish
or
lean
fish
or
may
be
some
others
like
crustaceans
right.
So,
fatty
fish;
obviously ,
from
the
word
it
appears,
that
the
fish
contains
high
fat
right
fish
contains
high
fat,
but
if
it
is
not
that
fatty
fish
if
it
is
less
fat
then
that
is
called
lean
fish.
Lean
fish
has
roughly
less
than
around
2
percent
fat
and
fatty
fish
has
high
as
20
percent
fat.
20
percent
fat
is
a
very
high
quantity
right
20
percent
fat
is
very
very
high
quantity
and
again
I
am
saying
that,
the
fat
which
is
comes
from
the
fish
is
more
assimilable
than
that
from
themeat
even
the
proteins
are
also
more
assimilable
than
that
in
the
from
the
rather
are
other
meat
right.
So,
these
are
the
two
variable
varieties
that
is
meat
and
fish
and
third
one
is
under
the
category
of
poultry .
But
poultry;
that
means,
which
is
being
reared
right
which
is
being
reared
may
be
at
home
or
commercially
that
is
different,
but
from
there
it
may
comes
under
the
egg
or
hen
right
chicken,
duck
then
turkey ,
all
these
which
are
which
are
being
reared
at
home
or
may
be
commercially ,
they
come
under
the
purview
of
the
poultry
right.
So,
poultry
contains
chicken
duck
turkey .
So,
all
these
foods
they
do
supply
these
six
basic
nutrients,
which
we
have
stated
that
fat
protein
carbohydrate,
vitamin
minerals
and
water
these
are
being
supplied
by
these
food
material.
Be
it
animal
origin,
be
it
plant
origin
right.
But
I
as
I
was
just
referring
earlier
that
nowadays
you
might
have
come
across
with
one
word
all
over
that
it
should
be
taken
as
a
balanced
diet
right.
I
go
back
to
the
case
which
I
said
somebody
was
strapped
in
high
altitude
nothing
was
there.
The
reverse
of
that
if
knowingly
if
you
give
somebody
only
fat
the
whole
day
no
other
thing
only
fat;
some
other
body
a
person
only
protein
no
other
thing
some
third
person
only
carbohydrate
no
other
thing
right
will
they
survive?
Obviously ,
the
answer
is
they
will
survive.
Because
our
body
system
is
such
there
are
two
types
of
reactions
not
too
many
one
can
be
categorized
as
chemical
reaction
and
another
is
biochemical
our
body
system
whatever
inside
reactions
are
happening,
they
come
under
the
purview
umbrella
of
the
biochemical
right
any
associated
with
bios
are
with
this
directly
or
indirectly
right.
So,
our
in
those
biochemical
systems,
those
where
fat
is
only
supplied,
this
fat
because
our
respiration
as
we
said
that
the
basic
starting
point
is
glucose.
So,
if
it
is
glucose
and
if
I
am
taking
fat
where
from
glucose
will
come?
And
I
am
respiring
every
now
and
then
every
women.
So,
glucose
is
all
time
required.
So,
body
system
through
those
biochemical
systems
biochemical
reactions
convert
it
to
glucose.
So,
that
respiration
is
continued
same
is
true
with
the
protein
or
carbohydrate
also.
If
you
do
not
take
glucose
directly
if
we
take
some
other
starch
material,
then
also
that
is
being
converted
to
glucose
and
then
only
we
can
we
can
sustain
we
can
we
can
take
respiration
right.So,
this
means
that,
the
basic
things
are
all
these
six
nutrients,
but
the
combination
of
them
in
a
judiciary
manner
in
a
better
way,
that
is
why
that
thing
came
that
you
should
have
a
balanced
diet
so,
that
it
is
supplying
everything
to
the
body ,
body
does
not
have
to
do
unnecessarily .
As
I
gave
the
example
fat
to
this
glucose
body
had
to
make
that
system.
So,
may
be
some
other
required
things
it
could
not
do.
So,
that
is
why
if
we
supply ,
the
new
thing
that
is
the
balanced
diet
to
the
body
then
the
person
should
be
perfectly
all
right
ok.
So
let
us
stop
it
today ,
here
we
will
start
next
day
and
next
hour.
Thank
you.
