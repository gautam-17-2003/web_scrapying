Casein
Micelle
So,
as
we
said
that
casein
contains
alpha,
beta,
gamma
and
kappa
casein
and
reasons
for
the
hydrophobicity
we
have
discussed
right.
W e
also
said
that
we
will
may
be
coming
across
though
we
have
completed
earlier
what
is
micelle,
protein
micelle
all
these
we
have
said,
but
casein
micelle
we
will
have
a
little
discussion
on
that
also.
So,
in
today’ s
yeah
in
today’ s
our
this
course
that
is
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology
in
30th
lecture,
we
will
start
with
Casein
Micelle
right.
So,
casein
micelle
is
what?
Is
that,
that
the
molecules
of
casein
plus
minerals
that
is
calcium
phosphate
right.
So,
casein
micelle
is
molecules
of
casein
plus
mineral
that
is
calcium
phosphate
together
is
forming
the
micelle
right.
Y ou
remember
in
micelle
we
had
given
this
kind
of
a
pictorial
view
right,
where
we
had
shown
that
so
these
are
having
some
thread
like
linking
where
we
have
1
hydrophobic
and
1
hydrophilic
hydrophobic
and
1
hydrophilic
end
right
so
those
we
had
said
earlier .
Now ,
it
is
casein
micelle
is
that
where
molecular
casein
or
molecules
of
casein
plus
minerals
in
the
form
of
calcium
phosphate
they
associate
or
agglomerate
or
they
form
this
bonding
and
that
is
the
micelle.
Out
of
which
the
composition
is
93
percent
casein
is
to
4
phospho
proteins
right;
so,
93
percent
casein
in
4
phosphoproteins
right.
In
which
alpha
s
1
casein
is
around
36
percent,
that
is
alpha
s
2
form
is
around
10
percent,
beta
casein
is
around
34
percent
and
kappa
casein
is
around
12
percent
which
we
had
said
earlier
also.
Now ,
7
percent
colloidal
mineral
complex
7
percent
colloidal
mineral
complex
around,
so
93
percent
was
casein
where
4
phosphoproteins
were
there
and
7
percent
colloidal
mineral
complex
is
there
where
phosphate,
calcium,
magnesium
and
citrates
are
present.
So,
the
casein
micelle
as
we
said
is
comprised
of
the
casein
molecules
plus
the
phosphates,
now
this
phosphates
are
around
7
percent
or
the
minerals
are
around
7
percent
may
be
in
the
form
of
calcium
or
phosphate
or
many
others
and
93
percent
is
out
of
the
casein
and
out
of
which
we
have
given
the
distribution
of
alpha
beta
kappa
and
alpha
s
1
alpha
s
2
right.
So,
these
distribution
we
have
said
and
the
the
minerals
are
calcium
phosphates
ok
phosphate
calcium
magnesium
citrate,
they
act
like
the
minerals
and
they
all
put
together
forms
the
casein
micelle
right.
Then
if
we
look
at
this
is
one
of
the
simplest
model
of
the
casein
micelle,
there
are
n
number
of
rather
this
kind
of
casein
micelle
models
are
there.
In
earlier
class
I
had
shown
1
here
also
I
am
showing
you
another
there
are
submicelles
subunits,
heiry
chains
calcium
phosphates
this
are
there.
So,
hairy
layers
are
that
this
is
called
the
Structure
with
subunits
where
the
subunits
are
there
and
this
is
called
the
open
structure,
where
things
are
hairy
like
this
is
this
appears
to
be
like
here
right.
So,
this
is
the
one
model
which
is
there
are
I
said
n
number
of
similar
models
are
there
and
as
from
it
is
appearing
it
is
very
very
complex
right
this
given
some
reference
also,
so
that
we
can
cross
refer
if
required
right.
Now ,
this
casein
micelle
which
we
have
just
seen
is
what,
that
is
the
polymers
are
built
up
of
polymers
are
built
up
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
individual
casein
molecules,
and
form
a
colloidal
solution
now
we
know
that
casein
is
present
in
the
colloidal
form.
So,
this
colloidal
form
where
hundreds
and
thousands
of
casein
molecules
or
individual
casein
molecules
they
form
this
colloids
or
colloidal
step
in
the
milk
right.
These
molecular
complexes
are
known
as
casein
micelle
and
this
micelle
may
be
as
lar ge
as
0.4
micrometre
right
as
lar ge
as
0.4
micrometre
and
can
only
be
seen
under
microscope,
because
that
is
why
it
is
called
micrometre,
that
is
you
cannot
see
in
naked
eye
it
has
to
be
seen
under
microscope
0.4
is
very
very
small
right.
Y ou
remember
the
other
day
we
said
that
dancing
of
fat
globules
can
be
seen
under
microscope
high
resolution
microscope
and
there
the
globular
size
is
around
2410
this
kind
of
microns,
but
it
is
one
tenth
of
that.
So,
10
times
magnification
if
you
have
even
then
you
can
see
10
times
magnification
of
the
microscope
which
you
saw
with
for
the
fat
globule.
So,
10
times
of
that
magnification
if
you
have
in
your
microscope
you
can
see
the
protein
micelle
also.
So,
it
is
as
lar ge
as
around
0.4
micrometre
right.
A
medium
size
micelle
consists
of
about
400
to
500
submicelles
which
are
bound
together ,
this
from
the
pictorial
view
we
have
shown
that
these
submicelles
they
agglomerate,
they
form
the
chains
and
these
chains
are
there
around
how
many
400
to
500
subunit
submicelles
are
there.
So,
alpha
beta
caseins
are
mainly
concentrated
in
the
middle
of
these
submicelle,
while
kappa
casein
predominates
in
the
surface.
So,
can
you
give
an
why
it
is
so
because,
when
we
discussed
about
alpha
beta
gamma
kappa
caseins
that
time
we
have
shown
we
have
seen
rather
or
we
have
told
that
alpha
beta
are
more
hydrophobic
or
hydrophobicity
is
there
in
alpha
beta.
Whereas,
kappa
is
much
less
hydrophobic
or
varies
less
hydrophobic
so
those
which
are
hydrophobic
they
are
inside
interior
not
in
the
outer
periphery ,
so
that
the
water
that
is
hydro
part
is
away
from
them
whereas,
the
kappa
casein
which
is
not.
So,
hydrophobic
is
on
the
surface
on
the
periphery .
So,
that
that
water
molecules
are
not
so
much
so
much
repelled,
otherwise
what
will
happen
everything
will
come
down
and
the
colloid
will
be
disturbed
and
if
the
colloid
is
disturbed
then
it
will
drop
down.
So,
that
is
not
happening
so
how
the
mechanism
is
that
alpha
beta
those
who
which
are
hydrophobic
they
are
in
the
interior
of
the
micelle;
whereas,
in
the
exterior
of
the
micelle
that
is
in
the
surface
or
periphery
part
this
is
the
kappa
casein
which
is
there,
for
which
the
stability
of
the
that
colloid
is
there
in
the
milk
right.
The
hydrophilic
protruding
chain
of
the
kappa
casein
protrudes
from
surface
of
the
sub
micelle
forming
a
hairy
layer
which
is
around
5
to
10
nanometre
in
size,
this
hairy
layer
which
we
have
seen
here
like
that.
So,
these
hairy
layers
are
around
5
to
10
nanometre
in
size
right,
you
remember
we
said
the
micelle
is
around
0.4
micrometre
right
and
this
hairy
sub
micelles
are
around
5
to
10
nanometres
right.
Kappa
casein
is
deficient
sub
micelle
are
mainly
located
in
the
centre
of
the
micelle,
whereas
kappa
casein
rich
sub
micelle
predominate
on
the
surface
giving
whole
micelle
a
hairy
surface
layer
right.
So,
those
which
are
not
so
bad
with
water
they
can
they
can
stay
with
water ,
so
they
will
be
on
the
periphery
on
the
surface
whereas,
those
which
are
hydrophobic
they
are
in
the
interior
of
the
micelle
and
they
are
hydrophobic
in
nature.
Hairy
layer
of
kappa
caseins
protruding
chain
is
partially
responsible
for
the
micelles,
stability
through
a
major
contribution
to
the
negative
char ge
of
the
micelle.
And
calcium
phosphate
and
hydrophobic
interactions
between
sub
micelles
are
responsible
for
the
integrity
of
the
casein
micelle
right.
So,
this
phosphates
which
are
present
in
casein
they
are
hydrophilic,
so
they
counter
act
the
hydrophobicity
right.
So,
they
counter
act
the
hydrophobicity
and
more
phosphate
groups
are
there
better
the
colloidal
stability ,
so
now
adding
an
excess
calcium
and
phosphate
results
in
aggregation
of
sub
micelle
into
lar ger
units
of
micelles.
So,
if
you
have
more
calcium
that
is
binding
material,
which
binds
the
sub
micelles.
So,
when
you
have
those
binding
materials
like
calcium
or
phosphates,
so
they
bound
or
they
bind
rather
the
sub
micelles
and
they
form
lar ger
units
the
sub
micelles
then
form
lar ger
units
and
more
and
more
stability
towards
the
that
colloidal
suspension
of
the
or
colloidal
nature
of
the
protein
in
milk.
Reason
for
this
aggregation
is
presumably
due
to
the
deposition
of
calcium
phosphate
in
the
sub
micelle,
which
lowers
their
electric
char ge
and
make
them
more
compact
right.
Then
this
is
how
the
casein
phosphoprotein
these
are
helping
in
stabilizing
the
micelle.
Y ou
see
the
earlier ,
I
said
in
earlier
class
that
the
this
amino
acids
this
amino
acids
are
in
the
sequences
right.
Here
also
you
see
in
beta
casein,
we
have
the
you
say
this
glu
that
is
glutine
or
glutane
and
then
ser
then
L
e
u
then
ser
then
Ser
then
ser
then
glu
that
is
dif ferent
and
I
did
not
show
you
that
one,
I
have
seen
that
how
in
the
next
class
I
ok
will
show
you,
that
how
that
glycine
glu
could
be
glycine.
So,
this
glycine
or
no
glutamic
acid
this
could
be
glutamic
acid
or
glutamate
right.
So,
glycine
glutamate
how
they
are
abbreviated
or
how
they
are
getting
that
coding,
this
I
will
tell
you
in
the
subsequent
class
ok.
However
we
see
here
that
this
is
like
that.
So
in
the
15th
position
this
is
the
1
phosphate
in
17th
position,
another
phosphate
in
18th
position
another
phosphate
in
19
position
another
phosphate
like
that
in
35th
position
another
phosphate.
So,
these
are
normally
in
the
beta
glycine
or
beta
casein.
Then
in
alpha
s
1
casein
it
is
more
it
is
46
position
one
phosphate
48
position
one
phosphate
64th
position,
another
phosphate
then
66th
position
another
phosphate,
then
67
68
like
that
even
1 14
position
some
phosphates
are
there.
This
is
the
how
casein
and
phosphates
they
are
linked.
Then
alpha
S2
casein
in
that
it
is
S2
we
if
you
remember
in
earlier
class
we
had
said
that
alpha
S1
is
more
hydrophobic
than
alpha
S2
right;
alpha
S2
is
much
less
Here
you
see
the
reason
is
that;
here
it
is
from
8th
position
9th
position
tenth
position
where
it
was
15
46
is
this
positions
right.
So,
up
to
61
56
so
many
so
because
of
that
this
alpha
S2
are
having
your
lot
of
hydrophilic
nature,
than
that
of
the
alpha
S1
right,
so
because
of
the
presence
of
the
phosphate
groups
right.
Similarly
kappa
casein
this
of
course
is
having
very
less
phosphate
because
kappa
casein
otherwise
because
of
the
because
of
the
chain
or
because
of
the
composition
of
the
this
your;
the
this
carbon
chain
not
only
carbon
chain
that
because,
of
the
composition
of
the
your
acid
this
what
we
called
or
just
now
we
said
that
because
of
this
composition
of
the
amino
acids;
this
amino
acids
because,
of
that
how
they
are
linked
by
which
of
the
amino
acids
the
kappa
casein
is
having
more
hydrophobicity
a
less
hydrophobicity
or
more
more
hydrophilic
nature
right,
so
this
is
how
they
are
coming.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
that
casein
precipitation.
Casein
precipitation
happens
1
characteristic
property
of
casein
is
it
is
ability
to
precipitate
at
pH
4.6
that
is
isoelectric
point
of
the
casein
is
4.6
right.
Y ou
remember
that
we
had
said
that
these
caseins
they
do
have
char ge
right
and
when
you
are
adding
this
acid;
that
means,
you
are
adding
some
more
char ges.
So,
they
are
neutralizing
so
when
it
becomes
that
isoelectric
point
4.6,
then
that
corresponds
to
the
sedimentation
of
the
separation
of
the
casein
that
is
how
casein
precipitates
right.
Due
to
the
complex
nature
of
the
casein
molecules
and
that
of
the
micelle
formed,
from
them
precipitation
can
be
caused
by
a
number
of
factors
or
agents
right
number
of
factors
or
agents.
So,
that
is
responsible
for
the
precipitation
of
the
casein
right.
So,
now
let
us
look
into
the
other
part
of
the
casein;
that
it
is
a
snow
white
odourless,
tasteless,
granular ,
substance,
contributes
to
the
whiteness
of
the
milk.
This
is
one
property
of
casein,
found
in
combination
with
calcium
as
calcium
caseinate,
dispersed
state
as
colloidal
suspension,
on
boiling
freshly
milk
thin
layer
of
finely
precipitated
casein
together
with
other
milk
constituents
including
fat
forms
a
thin
layer
over
the
surface
of
the
milk
with
acid
added
acid
it
curdles.
This
we
said
also
earlier
that
when
mummy
and
others
we
have
seen,
when
they
are
boiling
milk
that
what
is
happening
this
casein
or
the
protein
both
soluble
and
insoluble
because,
that
high
temperature
you
are
boiling.
So,
the
whey
protein
also
becomes
insoluble.
So,
both
whey
protein
and
casein
they
come
out
not
only
the
these
2,
but
also
along
with
that
fat
and
many
others
they
do
come
out
form
a
fine
layer
or
crust
on
the
surface
of
the
milk,
a
which
does
not
allow
the
vaporization
of
the
water
from
inside
thereby
is
giving
our
upper
ward
thrust
for
which
the
crust
becomes
swollen
and
then
ultimately
it
spills
over
right.
So,
this
is
how
the
spilling
of
the
milk
during
boiling
is
occurring
right
and
if
there
is
high
acidity ,
then
it
curdles
that
is
also
already
discussed
right.
Now ,
where
it
is
used?
Casein
is
main
used
mainly
in
manufacturing
of
hard
water
resistance
non
inflammable
plastics
right,
high
quality
plastics
like
celluloid’ s
those
were
photographs
have
been
taken
they
are
made
of
casein
because,
casein
and
a
great
a
great
quantity
of
casein
is
used
there.
High
quality
of
comb
there
also
casein
is
used
high
quality
of
this
glass
frames
there
casein
is
used
right.
So,
casein
is
of
really
having
very
wide
utilization
or
it
usability
right
this
is
substitute
for
this
celluloid
horn
tortoise
shell
a
wide
variety
of
toilet
article
such
as
comb
button
or
rims
for
eyeglasses.
Fountain
pen
barrels
electrical
insulations
high
grade
paper
around
80
percent
of
casein
is
used.
The
we
see
paper
qualities
of
dif ferent
type
right
not
only
the
paper
on
which
you
we
are
writing
normally ,
not
only
on
the
leaflets
which
are
of
very
poor
quality ,
but
also
we
get
very
very
great
quality
of
papers
where
good
good
photographs
and
other
things
are
impregnated
or
printed
right.
So,
those
high
grade
high
quality
papers
they
are
also
made
of
protein
this
casein
and
to
the
tune
of
80
percent
of
the
casein
is
used
for
that
right.
So,
for
very
great
quality
of
paper
manufacturing
you
need
very
good
quality
of
protein
or
good
quantity
also
of
protein.
Then
in
forming
glue
or
cold
water
paint
this
protein
is
also
used
or
casein
is
also
used
right.
Then
we
come
to
the
other
use
that
is
it
is
also
used
in
textile,
it
is
also
used
in
textile
and
leather
industries
as
spreader
over
foliage
that
is
the
horticultural
work
or
to
spread
and
adhere
better
as
casein
fiber
or
aralac
is
there
or
it
forms
as
in
hat
industry
in
hat
in
the
manufacture
of
fur
felt
hats
right.
In
typically
those
where
cold
systems
are
there
right
cold
weather
is
there,
there
we
have
seen
people
are
using
lot
many
fur
hats
right
those
fur
hats
they
are
also
being
produced
from
the
casein.
This
casein
has
a
wide,
this
casein
has
a
wide
variety
wide
application
and
fortunately
the
casein
availability
is
also
there
that
is
why
the
price
could
be
control,
but
mind
it
all
this
protein
is
coming
from
milk.
So,
at
the
cost
of
defatted
and
then
you
are
deproteinated
milk
you
are
using
because,
this
casein
you
are
getting
separated
right
this
casein
you
are
getting
separated
from
the
milk,
so
you
are
left
with
whey
right.
So,
unless
casein
you
are
precipitating
they
are
not
you
are
not
also
getting
the
casein,
so
that
means
that
milk
which
is
say
100
millilitre
or
100
gram
out
of
which
4
gram
only
protein
you
are
getting
right.
So,
you
are
100
millilitre
100
m
l
millilitre
of
milk
you
are
wasting
for
4
gram
of
the
casein
because
of
this
kind
of
use.
So,
as
a
dairy
person
or
as
a
part
of
the
dairy
you
will
obviously
not
1
unless
and
until
you
have
enough
quantity
of
milk
produced
you
will
not
be
allowing
this
to
happen
that
use
of
casein
for
some
more
other
purpose,
because
again
as
we
have
seen
that
in
the
milk
fat
it
is
more
assimilable
that
many
other
fats.
Similarly
this
milk
protein
is
better
assimilable
in
the
body
system
than
many
others
right.
So,
everything
we
cannot
just
tell
on
the
blackboard
or
on
the
board
itself
because
that
does
not
encompass
in
our
course
curricular
otherwise
we
will
not
be
able
to
finish
up
right.
So,
the
last
use
is
that
filler
or
binder
in
certain
foods
and
serves
as
the
base
material
for
a
meat
sauce
and
as
a
binder
in
sausages.
So,
we
have
seen
at
home
also,
that
in
many
cases
that
binders
are
being
used
for
binding.
For
small
example
that
many
times
you
might
have
seen
that
mummy
and
others
they
are
making
dishes
may
be
from
the
peel
of
some
of
the
vegetables.
These
peels
you
cannot
fry
in
they
become
individual
you
cannot
make
them
complex
or
compact.
So,
to
make
them
compact
you
have
to
have
some
binder ,
so
this
binder
this
casein
can
be
acted
as
the
binder
or
filler
agent
filler
that
is
filler
unit.
So,
that
binding
or
filling
this
come
this
can
be
done
with
the
help
of
this
casein
and
this
helps
in
making
dif ferent
dishes
like
sausage
or
sausages
many
such
kind
of
things
are
being
done
with
the
help
of
the
casein
right.
So,
with
this
let
us
stop
casein
today ,
as
I
promised
that
in
the
next
class
I
will
show
you
how
the
naming
alpha
beta
A,
B,
C,
D,
E,
F
how
this
naming
for
the
amino
acids
are
being
done
right.
Thank
you.
