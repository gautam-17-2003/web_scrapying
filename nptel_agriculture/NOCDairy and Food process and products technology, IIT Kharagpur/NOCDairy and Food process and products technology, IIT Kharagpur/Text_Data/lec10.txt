Emerging
Technology
So,
we
now
go
to
another
topic
that
is
on
this
Emer ging
Technology ,
right.
So,
we
go
to
this
emer ging
technology ,
which
we
said
in
the
last
class
because
of
the
time
constant
we
could
not
cover
it,
but
today ,
we
shall
cover
it.
And
again
emer ging
technology ,
it
is
definitely
those
which
are
coming
up
or
which
might
or
might
not
have
taken
your
commercial
aspect
or
commercial
application.
But
they
have
the
possibility
and
they
have
the
enough
for
reasoning;
why
should
they
be
brought
into
this
I
mean
into
commercialization
that
is
also
there.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:25)
So,
let
us
look
into
that.
So,
emer ging
technology;
what
are
the
drivers
opportunity
means
why
should
we
number
1
is
the
product
quality
and
safety .
So,
products
quality
and
safety
is
well
maintained
or
well
added
to
consume;
it
can
produce
consumer
convenience.
As
well
if
the
total
cost
of
the
system
is
also
comparable
or
it
could
be
brought
down.
So,
then
the
emer ging
technology
can
come
up,
otherwise,
if
you
have
a
conventional
technology
and
if
that
is
not
so
bad
compared
to
the
new
technology ,
why
people
should
come
for
what;
unless
1
it
encompasses
all
this
three
factors;
that
is
the
quality
and
safety
and
your
convenience
of
the
consumers
as
well
the
cross
criteria.
So,
if
all
these
three
are
adhere
to;
then
emer ging
technology
can
come
up.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
then;
what
are
the
technological
advancements
in
that?
Emer ging
technologies:
packaging
process,
packaging
material
and
value
added
features
all
these
are
coming
up
also
along
with
the
technologies.
That
packaging
industry
as
really
gone
up
very
high
and
packaging
materials
also,
many
people
are
working
on
packaging
different
packaging
materials
and
today
or
tomorrow ,
some
new
and
new
materials
are
coming
up
and
that
may
help.
This
is
called
augmentation
of
the
technology ,
if
there
be
any
emer ging
technology
coming
up,
then
this
packaging
industry
packaging
material
can
definitely
put
up
big
thumb
into
that.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
03:39)
Now ,
let
us
look
into
that
to
do
that;
what
could
be
the
challenges
which
new
technology
or
emer ging
technology
may
face
with,
right,
number
one
that
they
may
be
disruptive
in
the
supply
chain
because
normally ,
what
the
supply
chain
is
ongoing
when
you
are
introducing
a
new
technology .
So,
that
could
hamper
the
supply
chain
mechanism.
So,
that
could
be
a
challenge.
So,
as
early
as
it
could
be
recovered;
that
will
be
the,
that
will
be
good
for
both
the
producer
as
well
as
the
consumer .
2
Then
infrastructure;
that
could
be
also
a
major
challenging
threat
to
the
new
technologies
because
infrastructure
the
more
it
is
developed
better
for
the
entire
technology
as
well
for
the
consumer;
asset
flexibility
over
cost
of
capital.
So,
asset
flexibility
or
cost
of
capital
means
if
you
have
whatever
assets
because
whenever
you
are
making
an
industry ,
definitely ,
you
will
have
those
instruments,
equipments,
those
will
be
an
asset
and
also
land,
area,
buildings,
etcetera;
they
become
the
asset.
But
how
much
cost
you
have
to
incur
as
capital;
that
also
will
have
some
challenge
on
the
new
technology
to
come
up
because
the
this
asset
come
this
cost
that
should
be
also
very
look
creative,
otherwise,
new
people
new
entrepreneur
will
think
twice
or
may
not
come
forward
and
last
of
all
the
safety
regulations,
right.
So,
if
the
safety
regulations
are
well
maintained,
right,
then
definitely
that
will
be
helpful
for
the
new
technology
to
come
up.
So,
what
could
be
recommendations
for
the
new
technology
to
come
up
for
general
people
who
are
directly
or
indirectly
associated
that
is
you
the
people
should
strategically
co
operate,
,
cooperate
they
should
develops
skill
people.
So,
the
new
technology
the
people
who
are
doing
for
a
long
time
with
one
type
of
technology
indigenous
or
conventional
or
any
technology
which
is
ongoing
if
that
has
to
be
replaced
so,
that
skill
of
the
people
who
are
working
that
should
be
also
brought
high
otherwise
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
new
technology
to
come
up,
then
consumer
education
this
is
also
required.
In
most
of
the
cases
consumer
means
who
is
consuming
right
anybody
who
is
consuming
can
be
said
as
a
consumer .
Now
that
you
just
think
of
a
nation
like
ours
where
you
as
an
educated
engineer
or
technologist
what
do
you
understand
and
what
some
common
man
who
does
not
have
that
much
background
or
that
much
knowledge
about
the
product
about
the
implications
about
the
plus
and
minus
of
the
new
technology .
So,
unless
they
are
educated,
it
is
not
only
the
packaging
by
which
you
can
impress
on
them,
but
it
is
also
the
education
of
the
people
that
must
be
looked
into
and
you
must
be
able
to
convince
people
with
the
new
technology ,
right.
3(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:07)
Then
let
us
look
into
that;
what
are
the
emer ging
technologies,
since,
it
will
take
if
we
make
the
slide
in
the
vertical
it
will
take
lot
of
space.
So,
to
minimize
that
I
have
made
it
like
this,
you
see
consumer;
what
they
desire;
there
is
from
the
consumer
point
of
view;
minimally
preserved
and
processed
food
that
is
what
they
want.
Then
this
should
lead
to
more
convenience
in
terms
of
shelf
life,
then
in
terms
of
storage,
in
terms
of
preparation
for
consumption.
So,
this
convenience
both
in
terms
of
shelf
life
storage
or
in
terms
of
preparation
for
consumption;
that
consumer
wants
that
we
should
be
the
most
convenient.
Then
higher
quality
in
terms
of
flavor ,
texture,
appearance
that
is
also
consumers
demand,
it
should
be
more
fresher
with
the
new
technology ,
more
natural
and
naturally
healthier ,
right
in
a
or
nutritionally
healthier ,
it
should
be
nutritionally
also
healthier
as
well
minimally
packaged.
Finally ,
it
should
be
safer
that
is
the
point
which
consumers
want
that
all
these
aspects
if
taken
care
of,
then
introduction
of
new
technology
perhaps
they
will
have
minimum
resistance
and
they
will
be
cooperative
right.
So,
retailer
then
you
look
into
not
before
going
into
the
producer
let
us
look
into
that
scientists
and
technologists,
what
they
say.
Scientist
and
technologists
says
that
with
minimal
changes,
we
can
make
milder
processing
with
respect
to
minimal
overheating,
less
intensive
heating
and
fewer
additives
with
respect
to
less
use
of
a
chemical
preservatives
that
can
be
brought
into.
So,
as
a
technologist
or
as
a
scientist,
they
look
into
that
we
can
minimally
over
heat
or
we
can
heat
less
so,
that
heat
sensitive
materials;4
they
are
not
damaged
and
we
can
add
few
chemically
preserved
pre
chemical
preservatives
so
that
consumers
which
they
wanted
that
could
be
minimized,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:12)
Then
it
comes
to
the
level
of
and
along
with
that
increased
use
of
combination
of
hurdle
technologies,
right
combination
of
hurdle
technologies,
they
say
that
yes
we
can
do
this
that
combination
of
hurdle
increased
use
of
combination
of
hurdle
technologies
that
can
be
done
by
the
scientists
what
they
say.
Then
evaluation
and
use
of
naturally
occurring
preservation
system
that
can
be
introduced,
reduction
in
levels
of
salt,
fat,
sugar
that
can
be
done,
reduced
environmentally
friendly
packaging,
right;
reduced
or
packaging
reduced
or
environmentally
friendly
packaging
can
be
introduced
and
more
attention
can
be
given
to
the
elimination
of
food
poisoning
microor ganisms
from
the
most
often
contaminated
foods.
In
many
parts
of
the
world
even
in
the
developed
countries
where
things
are
much
developed,
but
even
there
this
problem
of
getting
contaminated
or
infection
is
rapid
or
I
do
not
say
it
is
epidemic,
but
when
it
occurs,
then
it
be
also
may
become
epidemic
depending
on
the
product
and
then
the
manufactures
withdraw
those
or
withdraws
those
kind
of
products
from
the
market.
So,
that
further
damage
can
be
controlled,
right.
So,
scientists
and
technologists
says
that
this
can
be
taken
care
of
with
the
new
technologies,
right.
Then
what
are
the
existing
technologies
we
have
to
inhibit
the
growth
of
the
microor ganisms
in
food,
we
have
lowering
of
temperature
by
chilling
freezing
and
storing
at
5
low
temperature,
by
lowering
the
water
activity
which
we
have
by
drying,
curing,
addition
of
sugar
all
these
we
have
by
lowering
of
technologies.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:43)
Then
by
lowering
of
pH
by
acidification,
right
which
we
have
that
is
either
by
acidification
or
by
fermentation
we
can
lower
the
pH
by
increasing
the
vacuum
technology
that
is
by
removing
the
oxygen
from
the
packaged
material.
So,
in
by
that
vacuum
technology
or
vacuum
packaging
is
also
there.
We
also
have
nowadays
modified
atmosphere
packaging
or
map
where
addition
of
maximum
of
carbon
dioxide,
oxygen
or
nitrogen,
this
adjustment
can
be
done
not
only
addition,
but
also
adjustment
of
the
concentration
of
carbon
dioxide,
oxygen
and
nitrogen
that
can
be
adjusted.
Then
addition
of
preservatives
that
is
also
there
inorganic
like
sulphite,
nitrite;
these
are
there;
organics
substances
like
sorbate,
benzoate,
propionate
these
also
there.
And
some
antibiotics
like
nisin
that
are
also
there,
right
and
there
are
also
controlling
food
micro
structure.
By
controlling
food
microstructure
like
that
oil
water
emulsion,
oil
water
or
water
oil
immersion,
right.
So,
depending
on
whether
your
oil
is
in
the
primary
phase
or
main
phase
or
continuous
phase
or
oil
is
in
continues
phase
and
water
is
in
the
dispersed
phase
depending
on
that
this
is
also
there
right.
To
inactivate
in
organisms
in
foods
what
we
do,
we
heat
to
inactivate
we
heat
thereby
we
do
pasteurize,
for
example,
heating
which
we
normally
come
across
is
by
pasteurization,
sterilization
or
pasteurization
sterilization
drying
we
have
6
already
see
drying
is
another ,
but
this
is
with
respect
to
liquid
food
normally ,
this
is
pasteurized
and
sterilized
right
and
we
also.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:35)
So,
we
also
restricting
access
of
the
organisms,
we
can
that
is
by
packaging
or
aseptic
processing
processing
and
aseptic
packaging,
right.
To
use
naturally
occurring
preservative
systems
what
is
ongoing
is
bacteriolytic;
obviously ,
from
the
term
bacteriolytic,
it
appears
that
if
the
bacteria
is
which
can
be
kept
aside
that
is
it
can
be
killed
or
bacteriostatic
which
can
be
which
can
be
killed
or
which
can
be
removed
and
other
enzymes
for
example,
iysozyme
or
lysozyme,
then
lactoperoxidase;
these
enzymes
do
act
on
them.
Some
non
enzymatic
proteins
and
other
poly
peptides
for
example,
nisin,
then
pediocin,
then
culture
products
then
some,
lactoferricin,
all
these
are
non
enzymatic
preservatives
which
are
used,
plant
derivative
or
plant
derived
other
anti
microbes
which
we
use
our
herbs
and
spices
that
is
extracts
that
leads
to
the
development
of
new
and
new
method.
7
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:15)
Right;
now
the
efficacy
of
these
methods
of
course
that
can
be
judged
or
assessed
by
the
required
commercial
exploitation,
how
it
can
be
proved
that;
what
is
the
efficacy
means
how
much
it
is
fruitful
to
the
product
or
with
the
system
that
has
to
be
exploited
commercially
right.
Now
emer ging
physical
technologies
which
I
have
which
are
coming
up
is
by
high
pressure
technology
right
or
normally
sorry
we
call
it
to
be
hpp;
high
pressure
technology .
So,
that
high
pressure
technology
or
hpp
that
can
be
miraculous,
but
again
as
I
said
right
in
the
beginning
that
everything
you
have
to
keep
in
mind,
it
is
not
only
the
technology
itself
with
this,
this
is
the
learning
process
that
is
why
you
are
bringing,
but
when
you
are
considering
to
implement
it,
definitely ,
we
will
keep
all
whichever
we
have
already
told
in
mine
to
decide
on
when
the
technology
should
be
adopted
or
not,
right.
So,
high
pressure
technology
is
one
such
which
has
which
is
coming
up
I
do
not
say
which
has
come
up
which
is
coming
up
where
combination
of
ultrasonic
heat
and
pressure
all
these
are
utilized
right;
either
hpp
itself
or
in
combination
with
ultrasonic
or
ultrasonic
method
and
heat
and
pressure
all
these
three
could
be
used
and
that
is
termed
as
manothermosonication;
that
is
termed
as
manothermosonication
where
combination
of
this
three
ultrasonic,
heat
and
pressure
all
these
three
variables
are
used
then
high
voltage
gradient
pulse
that
is
called
electroporation.
this
technique
is
called
electroporation
where
high
voltage
gradient
in
terms
of
pulse;
pulse
of
course,
means
as
you
know .
So,
this
we
called
pulse,
right,
this
kind
of
8
input
we
call
it
to
be
pulse.
Then
laser
and
non
coherent
light
pulses,
right,
where
we
could
use
that
laser
or
light
pulses
for
the
inactivation
or
may
be
as
the
new
technology .
Then
high
magnetic
field
pulses
again
that
can
be
used
where
magnetic
field
can
be
used
in
the
very
high
form
and
that
can
also
bring
to
our
new
technology
ok.
Now
if
you
look
into
simply
different
from
that
high
pressure.
Now
how
much
high
pressure,
it
is
high
to
the
tune
of
that
inactivates
vegetative
organisms
by
the
pressure,
right
in
pasteurization,
it
is
around
400
to
600
Mega
Pascal,
you
see
Mega
Pascal
around
4000
to
6000
atmosphere;
atmospheric
pressure
is
1
atmosphere,
right
and
it
you
make
it
5-6
atmosphere,
then
only,
it
becomes
the
booming
kind
of
thing,
4000
to
6000,
right,
this
is
of
course,
not
the
pressure
which
gas
pressure,
we
think
of,
this
is
normally
hydro
static
pressure
right.
So,
in
that
definitely
such
huge
pressure
can
be
built
up.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:44)
Now ,
why
should
we
will
what
it
does?
It
does
large
species
to
species
and
strain
to
strain
variation
and
very
large
productive
effects
from
the
constituents
of
sum
of
the
foods
at
low
water
activities,
for
example,
Escherichia
Coli
that
can
be
where
this
high
pressure
technology
can
be
used.
So,
definitely
how
much
pressure;
how
much
you
should
apply
we
have
given
a
range
of
4000
to
6000
atmosphere,
right.
So,
at
that
high
pressure
it
varies
from
species
to
species
or
strain
to
strain
how
much
pressure
should
be
applied,
right,
example
given
or
we
are
putting
that
Escherichia
Coli
this
number
can
be
one
such
right,
then
9
manothermosonication
where
it
is
a
combination
of
ultrasonic
facility ,
heat
and
pressure,
right.
Now ,
what
is
the
advantage
of
all
these
three
ultrasonication
at
high
enough
intensities
inactivate
bacteria
and
reduces
heat
resistance
of
the
bacterial
spores.
I
hope
we
understand
spores;
bacterial
spores
means
if
this
is
a
bacteria
say
rod
shaped
bacteria.
So
when
it
is
forming
a
spore
then
it
forms
another
coating
around
it
round
around
it
another
coating.
So,
this
is
very
resistant
to
the
cause
given
to
it,
right,
it
becomes
very
resistant.
So,
those
which
are
in
a
high
spore
performers,
they
are
more
inactive
they
are
more
resistant
and
it
is
difficult
to
inactivate
those.
So,
there
these
ultrasonication
helps
to
inactivate
these
bacterial
spores
right.
The
effect
of
syner gistic
effect
syner gistic
means,
it
is
both
together ,
right
syner gism
that
is
and
this
b
both
are
acting
together
and
jointly
the
effect
is
being
available.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
being
called
that
syner gistic
the
effect
is
syner gistic
with
raised
temperature
as
well
the
temperature
if
it
is
raised
then
overall;
of
course,
if
the
temperature
is
high
very
high,
then
overall
syner gism
is
reduced;
the
reason
being
high
temperature,
then
comes
into
picture
and
the
damage
is
done
by
the
high
temperature.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
a
combination
of
all
this
three
together
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:09)
10
Now ,
why
the
syner gism
is
done
as
you
said
because
as
the
vapour
pressure
of
water
rises,
it
has
the
effect
of
reducing
the
effectiveness
of
cavitation
which
is
the
main
cause
of
the
microbial
death
right.
Vapour
pressure,
why
it
will
raise
because
you
are
increasing
the
temperature.
So,
in
vapour
pressure
is
a
function
of
temperature.
So,
the
moment
you
are
increasing
the
temperature
that
will
also
raise
the
vapour
pressure
and
if
vapour
pressure
is
raise
then
deactivation
due
to
cavitation
is
reduced
and
cavitation
formation
of
causing
the
cavitation
is
one
of
the
primary
reason
why
the
organisms
are
destroyed.
So,
application
of
slight
overpressure,
if
you
maybe
if
you
bars
or
maintains
the
syner gism
at
the
higher
temperature,
thus
combination.
So,
if
you
increase
the
temperature,
then
simultaneously
you
also
increase
the
pressure.
So,
that
the
vapour
pressure
difference
that
does
not
become
significant
and
that
cavitation
problem
does
not
arise,
right.
So,
it
has
the
potential
for
reducing
the
pasteurization
and
sterilization
temperature
for
pumpable
liquids
and
for
semisolid
foods,
pumpable
liquid;
that
means
it
has
flow
ability .
Now
is
the
viscosity
becomes
very
high,
if
the
material
becomes
very
high
viscous,
then
pumpability
will
reduce.
So,
it
has
to
be
it
is
applicant
can
be
applied
to
those
where,
we
have
high
pumpability
of
the
liquid
or
of
the
fluid
or
of
the
food
right
or
if
it
is
semi
solid
so
that
the
pumpability
is
there,
then
this
technique
that
is
application
or
in
combination
of
syner gistic
effect
of
ultrasonic
as
well
temperature
and
pressure
these
in
combination
can
be
made
effective.
This
is
a
technique
which
is
coming
up
right,
I
do
not
say
it
has
come
up,
but
since
we
are
discussing
with
the
trends
of
the
recently
developed
technologies
so,
this
is
one
of
them.
So,
the
other
too
or
others
we
will
discuss
in
the
next
class
because
our
time
here
is
perhaps
limited.
Thank
you.
