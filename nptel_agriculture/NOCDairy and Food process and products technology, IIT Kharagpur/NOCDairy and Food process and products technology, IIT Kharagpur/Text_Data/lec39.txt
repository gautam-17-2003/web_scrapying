Natural
or
Other
Type
of
Spoilage
W e
are
discussing
milk
spoilage
right.
Primarily ,
we
have
discussed
on
the
dif ferent
aspects
of
how
microbes
are.
Now
we
will
look
into
this
in
lecture
number
39
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Processing
Products
T echnology ,
lecture
number
39,
natural
or
other
type
of
spoilages
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
first
the
natural
or
souring
curdling,
souring
of
curdling,
this
is
the
most
natural
light.
Why
you
call
it
to
be
natural
or
souring
of
cuddling?
This
we
call
natural
because,
example
we
have
given
n
number
of
times
that
you
keep
some
milk
just
like
that
for
couple
of
hours
or
several
hours,
then
without
doing
anything,
you
see
that
that
milk
has
curdled.
This
is
called
natural
curdling
or
natural
souring
right
where
the
or ganisms
have
invaded
from
the
ambient
or
surrounding
to
milk
causing
the
utilization
of
the
lactose
by
the
lactic
acid
bacteria
or
any
other
bacteria
which
might
have
invaded
into
milk
and
cause
the
acid
production
that
is
why
it
is
the
lactic
acid
right.
And
this
is
true
for
any
natural
disturbance
or
any
natural
changes
or
due
to
the
nature
which
has
cause
the
changes
in
the
milk
called
natural
souring
or
curdling
right.
So,
that
example
we
are
giving,
raw
milk
held
at
ambient
conditions
if
that
is
there,
then
it
happens.
Immediate
ef fect
is
souring
followed
by
curdling
due
to
the
acidity
that
is
lactic
acid
by
bacteria
already
present
in
milk
or
invaded
from
the
outside.
Fresh
milk
normally
do
have
the
acidity
around
0.1
to
0.19
percent
acidity
in
terms
of
lactic
acid
right.
So,
this
acidity
is
in
expressed
in
terms
of
lactic
acid
because
the
acid
produced
by
this
is
the
lactic
acid
that
is
why
it
is
expressed
in
terms
of
lactic
acids
right.
Milk
sours
between
0.2
to
0.25
percent
acidity ,
0.2
to
0.25
percent
acidity ,
the
milk
souring
takes
place;
curdling
has
not
taken
place
right.
Normal
milk
is
0.14
to
0.19
percent
of
lactic
acid.
Souring
of
milk
is
between
0.2
to
0.25
percent
of
lactic
acid
where
you
taste
sour
feeling
is
there
sour
taste
is
there
but
it
is
not
curdled.
For
curdling,
milk
curdles
at
0.5
to
0.65
percent
of
lactic
acid
right
and
COB,
that
is
Clot
On
Boiling
test,
I
said
some
day
I
will
tell
about
the
platform
test
like,
platform
test,
someday
will
tell,
may
not
be
today ,
some
other
day
platform
test.
In
there,
COB
is
one
test
right.
COB
is
called
Clot
On
Boiling.
If
you
take
a
milk
in
a
test
tube
and
heat
it
under
Bunsen
burner
or
any
heating
medium,
nowadays,
I
those
things
are
going
away
even
in
schools
and
colleges
that
Bunsen
and
burner
and
other
things
this
concept
is
going
of f.
Nowadays,
people
are
doing
it
with
gaseous,
that
is
normal
gaseous
right.
However ,
still
scientifically
we
call
ok
it
is
Bunsen
burner ,
you
keep
that
test
tube,
heat
it
and
when
you
are
heating
if
there
is
some
clot
formation
in
the
in
the
in
the
milk,
then
we
call
it
to
be
COB
positive,
that
is
clot
on
boiling
is
positive.
This
clot
and
boiling
tells
that
your
milk
is
highly
acidic
and
that
acidity
is
to
the
tune
of
0.3
to
0.45
percent
of
lactic
acid
right.
Curdling
is
taking
place
between
0.5
and
0.65
percent.
But
COB
is
positive,
that
it
is
acidic.
So,
if
you
put
it
as
I
gave
some
other
day
when
you
are
receiving
in
dairy
producing
or
some
milk
products
producing,
dairy
industry
if
you
are,
if
you
are
working
or
if
you
are
employed
then,
you
may
have
to
tell
out
of
lot
many
some
whether
I
will
not
many
rather
milk
sources,
we
have
to
tell
which
one
is
good,
which
one
is
bad,
which
one
is
to
be
thrown
out
or
given
back
to
the
supplier
and
which
one
we
will
take
back
for
further
treatment.
Now ,
if
you
find
some
of
them
are
COB
positive
then
obviously ,
there
is
a
chance
that
by
the
time
it
is
further
process
that
acidity
may
go
up
and
it
may
ultimately
curdled
the
milk
or
it
miss
boil
the
milk
total.
So,
from
may
be
50
liter
some,
thousands
of
lakhs
of
liters
milk
might
be
spoiled.So,
you
are
not
allowing.
So,
this
COB
is
one
such
platform
test
that
is
called
clot
on
boiling
whose
acidity
is
somewhere
between
0.3
to
0.45
percent
of
lactic
acid.
Acidity
increases
even
after
coagulation
of
casein
till
lactic
acid
producing
flora
inhibited
or
till
whole
of
lactose
is
exhausted
that
this
acid
tolerant
or ganisms
predominate
right.
Should
some
acids
tolerant
or ganisms
are
there.
So,
it
is
a
good
information
that
by
souring
your
pH
has
come
down
to
0.5
or
0.65
level.
So,
that
level
your
curdling
of
milk
has
occurred
but
scientifically ,
if
you
look
at
that
it
has
it
has
curdled
the
protein.
So,
we
will
there
be
further
acidity
producing?
It
is
yes.
Further
it
will
go
on
till
some
suf ficient
quantity
of
lactic
acid
is
produced.
So,
that
none
of
the
or ganisms
can
grow
or
survive
or
that
acid
tolerant
or ganisms
are
no
longer
surviving
or
multiplying
or
doing
action
or
all
the
lactose
which
is
present
is
exhausted
by
the
or ganisms.
So,
till
that
condition
the
acid
production
will
continue
right.
Then
acid
coagulation,
this
is
the
case
where
we
come
every
day
or
some
most
of
the
time
at
home;
acid
coagulation,
when
the
earlier
case
it
was
done
by
the
nature,
that
time
you
are
not
confident
whether
this
was
explicitly
done
by
some
known
or ganisms,
some
known
product
have
been
done
or
not.
So,
that
time,
that
curdled
milk
normally
you
don’ t
consume,
you
throw
it
because
that
was
done
by
the
natural
sources
could
be
originally
from
milk
or
could
be
invaded
from
the
outside
right.
So,
that
is
why
even
if
you
boil
milk
for
first
time
and
then
keep
it
for
long
period
in
hot
condition,
then
you
will
see
that
still
it
is
curdling
right.
So,
that
means,
during
boiling,
you
have
killed
all
the
or ganism
present
in
milk
but
subsequently ,
you
have
kept
it
outside
from
nature
it
has
invaded
into
the
milk
and
it
has
grown
up
at
ultimately
brought
the
level
of
pH
to
that
where
curdling
takes
place.
Now ,
it
is
not
only
the
pH
but
also
the
other
fermentation
products
are
respond
may
or
may
not
be
responsible
which
you
do
not
know
that
is
why
it
is
not
known
to
you
and
you
throw
it.
Y ou
don’ t
take
any ,
any ,
any ,
any
risk
of
consuming;
whereas,
now
what
you
are
saying
acid
coagulation;
so,
at
home,
when
you
are
doing,
when
mummy
is
doing
for
you
may
be
some
chhena,
maybe
some
whey
for
you
for
doctors
do
tell
when
you
are
weak,
you
are
to
be
given
more
protein.
So,
chhena
is
one
of
the
source
or
if
somebody’ s
stomach
is
not
good
upset,
so
he
may
not
be
given
chhena
protein
but
he
may
be
given
whey
only .
So,
that
type
mummy
or
seniors,
they
are
making
knowingly
some
acid
is
given
or
some
acids
also
are
given
like
calcium
lactate
or
things
like
that
or
may
be
some
nimbu
pani,
that
is
some
citric
acid
through
the
completion
of
the
this
nimbu
that
is
the
lemon,
you
are
creating
acidity
and
that
is
causing
your
curdling
of
the
protein
right.
So,
that
is
interaction
of
lactic
acid
with
calcium
bound
to
casein,
precipitation
of
casein
occurs
and
that
is
curd
where
the
pH
range
is
around
4.64
to
4.78.
Some
lactic
streptococci
or
like
streptococcus
lactis,
streptococcus
cremoris,
they
do
act
at
room
temperature
and
form
the
acid
coagulation
but
here
you
know
and
there
gets
the
it
inhibited
at
1
percent.
These
or ganisms
are
getting
inhibited
for
further
growth
or
activity
at
around
1
percent
level
of
lactic
acid.
Lactobacilli
species,
where
lactobacillus
casei
at
room
temperature
to
be
towards
and
produces
acidity .
Lactobacillus
acidophilus
and
Lactobacillus
bulgaricus,
they
optimally
at
around
40
degree
centigrade,
they
get
inhibited
by
around
2
percent
lactic
acid
level
right.
Leuconostocs
species
like
Leuconostoc
Dextranicum
and
Leuconostoc
Citrovorum
responsible
for
flavour
development
and
lower
level
of
lactic
acid.
So,
these
are
some
acid
coagulation
or
some
acid
forming
or ganisms
which
you
can
do
knowingly .Other
or ganisms
like
streptococcus;
so,
our
streptococci
other
or ganisms
like
streptococci.
So,
in
that
streptococcus
Thermophilus
at
around
45
degree
celsius
towards
though
it
is
produced
slowly
even
at
lower
temperature
range,
that
streptococcus
though
it
is
given
45
degree
centigrade
but
it
can
work
at
lower
temperature
range
also.
This
or ganism
is
also
capable
of
surviving
higher
heat
treatments
such
as
pasteurization
that
is
the
danger ,
that
this
some
of
the
streptococcus,
they
are
highly
heat
sensitive
heat
resistant
and
they
can
even
with
stand
the
pasteurization
temperature.
So,
that
is
why
you
have
to
do
after
pasteurization,
the
pasteurization
test
if
it
is
negative
then
by
all
possibility
it
is
taken
that
all
the
pathogenic
or ganisms
are
destroyed
right.
Streptococcus
liquefaciens
at
about
31
degree
centigrade
works
on
milk
and
milk
is
rapidly
coagulated
followed
by
proteolysis,
it
is
the
curd
to
shrink
from
the
walls
of
the
container
and
separation
of
whey
right.
Bacillus
coagulalls,
it
is
aerobic
spore
former .
It
is
survive
heating
and
multiply
and
produce
lactic
acid
at
around
31
to
35
degree
centigrade.
Then
coliforms;
some
coliforms
of
course,
coli
means
like
e
coli
and
others,
they
are
very
very
dangerous
pathogen
right,
very
very
dangerous
pathogen
normally
they
are
not
allowed
to
be
in
any
food
material.
But
even
if
it
is
invaded,
that
is
what
you
should
also
know
that
coliforms,
that
is
e
coli
and
Enterobacter
aerogenes
produces
acid
and
gas
around
37
degree
centigrade.
37
degree
centigrade
means
our
body
temperature
is
also
37
point
something.
So,
that
37
degree
is
the
body
temperature.
So,
that
the
body
temperature
is
also
this
coliform
can
grow
and
multiply .
The
coagulum
formed
by
lactic
streptococci
or
streptococcus
thermophilus
and
lactobacilli
is
smooth
and
with
typical
clean
sour
flavour
used
as
starter
culture
for
desirable
fermentation.
In
some
of
the
cases
like
informing
while
you
are
preparing,
while
you
are
preparing
say
some
acid
knowingly
right
knowingly
you
are
producing
like
in
cheese
where
you
are
producing
some
acid
or
may
be
developing
some
flavor ,
I
said
the
other
day
ripening.
So,
that
ripening
process,
you
are
developing
some
flavour
knowingly .
So,
this
kind
of
or ganisms
may
help
to
do
those
flavour
forming
in
the
product
and
that
is
desirable.
Now
Streptococcus
liquefacien
is
the
liquefacienis
the,
this
or
beta
coagulans,
that
is
bacillus
B
coagulans
that
is
bacillus
coagulans
and
coliforms
produce
a
coagulum
with
undesirable
flavours
due
to
the
liberation
of
certain
volatile
flavour
substances
from
lactose,
proteins
and
milk.
So,
Streptococcus
liquefacienl,
that
liquefacienis
or
Bacillus
coagulans,
they
or
coliforms,
they
produce
some
coagulum
with
undesirable
flavour
which
liberates
from
certain
with
liberates
certain
volatile
flavour
substance
from
lactose
or
proteins
or
milk
which
are
not
desirable
right
undesirable.
Then,
then
we
come
to
the
flow
chart
of
how
this
is
also
a
part
of
that
our
mandate
which
we
are
given
that
how
the
liquid
milk
is
is
processed
right.
So,
that
processing
of
course
that
involves
lot
of
things
like
pasteurization,
homogenization
or
what
is
your
end
product
depending
on
that
your
things
are
dif ferent
right.
So,
what
is
your
end
product
that
will
dictate
how
you
will
be
following
the
process?
But
by
and
lar ge
to
have
one
general
process,
so
this
milk
fluid
processing
flow
chart
we
are
giving.
This
is
what
that
raw
fluid
processing
raw
milk
is
coming
in
the
storage,
storage
tank
lot
of
lot
of
materials
are
being
stored,
lot
of
milk
is
stored,
then
it
under goes
cleaning
and
decreaming
if
it
required
that
is
by
a
separator
vacuum
separator
is
used
if
it
is
decreamed
or
it
is
cleaning.
So,
cleaning
and
decreaming
that
step
could
be
there,
then
it
is
homogenized,
then
it
is
fat
standardized
right,
depending
on
what
is
your
end
product
fat
contain
you
want
right.
That
you
have
already
stated
that,
I
want
3.5
percent
fat
in
the
milk
or
I
want
4
percent
fat
in
the
milk
or
I
want
1.5
percent
fat
in
the
milk
or
could
be
I
want
only
0.5
percent
in
the
milk.
So,
you
know
your
end
product
right,
liquid
milk
end
product
you
know
and
normally ,
this
end
product
is
normally
this
end
product
is
characterized
by
the
fat
content
of
the
milk.
Also,
the
moment
fat
contains
in
fixed
simultaneously
your
that
Solid
Not
Fat
or
SNF
is
also
automatically
fixed
right.
So,
less
fat
more
SNF
or
more
fat
less
SNF ,
that
is
the
combination
right.
So,
you
know
what
is
your
SNF ,
what
is
your
fat
content.
The
moment
you
know ,
so
after
cleaning,
whether
you
will
de-cream
or
standardize
means,
either
you
will
take
out
the
fat
or
you
will
add
some
from
other
source,
some
more
fat
so
that
the
required
fat
content
is
achieved
right,
thats’
what
is
your
end
product
that
must
be
known
right.
So,
once
that
is
known.
So,
either
this
stage
or
this
stage
or
both
in
combination
are
followed.
Then
the
heat
treatment,
so
this
heat
treatment
is
done
for
deactivating
enzymes
deactivating
microbes.
So,
that
you
can
retain
it
for
a
longer
period;
the
enzymes
putrefying
enzyme
or
those
which
are
spoiling
enzymes,
they
are
deactivated
and
the
pathogenic
or ganisms
are
also
deactivated.
So,
these
two
are
done
and
then,
you
are
better
of f
with
the
product
that
what
you
want
to
make
that
product
you
know .
So,
you
have
already
done
either
standardization
or
by
de-creaming,
you
have
or
both
in
combination,
you
have
done,
you
are
right
fat
content
SNF
content
and
then
you
have
subjected
to
heating.
Then,
after
heating
chilling
is
done
and
chilling
also
is
done
by
some
heat
exchangers;
obviously ,
any
heat
either
giving
or
withdrawing,
any
heat
giving
or
withdrawing
is
achieved
by
heat
exchanger
right.
The
thing
where
heat
is
getting
exchange
whether
it
is
hot
or
cold
doesn’ t
matter
in
either
case,
it
is
the
heat
which
is
getting
exchanged.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
called
heat
exchanger .
So,
in
that
heat
exchanger ,
it
is
done
chilling
and
this
chilling
is
done
normally ,
quickly .
Since,
it
has
come
we
also
tell
that
this
quikness
or
this
after
heating
the
chilling
is
done
quickly
the
one
of
the
primary
reason
is
that,
it
is
not
that
or ganisms
associated.
It
is
that
your
milk
it
contains
high
quantity
of
proteinaceous
substances,
that
is
nitrogenous
substances
as
well
your
sugar
or
reducing
sugar
as
lactose.
So,
this
lactose
and
the
amino
group
of
the
protein
right;
so
they
do
react
forming
Maillard
reaction.
And
from
the
Q
10,
you
know
that
Q
10
was
there
the
higher
the
temperature,
the
higher
the
temperature,
higher
as
the
rate
of
reaction.
The
lower
the
temperature,
lower
is
the
rate
of
reaction.
This
was
known
right.
So,
that
is
why ,
when
you
have
heated
killed
or ganisms
at
high
temperature
if
that
amino
group
plus
your
sugar
if
that
is
reacting
forming
your
melanoides
right,
forming
melanoides
or
melanoidins.
So,
that
is
the
maillard
reaction
causing
brown
colour
that
is
not
desirable
right.
So,
you
are
chilling
it
quickly ,
avoiding
this
to
take
place
right
because
your
destruction
of
or ganisms
have
already
taken
place
while
you
have
heated
it
right.
So,
then
you
take
into
intermediate
storage
where
big
big
containers
are
there
with
cooling
facility
you
are
storing
normally
at
around
4
degree
centigrade,
you
are
storing
or
keeping
it.
And
from
there,
itdepending
on
whether
you
are
filling
it
in
a
tank
big
tank
or
you
are
filling
it
in
some
small
packaging
units
depending
on
how
you
are
distributing
your
material,
that
I
will
go
to
that
place
from
there
it
will
go
to
dispatch
right.
So,
this
is
how
the
fluid
milk
is
being
processed
right.
This
is
how
the
fluid
milk
is
being
processed.
So,
let
me
clean
the
board.
This
is
like
that
that,
fluid
milk
we
have
received
raw
milk
and
from
the
raw
milk
storage,
we
have
cleaned
it
or
decream
depending
on
as
we
said
the
end
product
what
you
need.
So,
decreamed
and
then
it
is
homogenized
so
that
fat
particles
becomes
uniform
at
a
smaller
globular
diameter ,
then
you
also
make
the
fat
standardization,
that
also
depends
on
what
is
your
end
product
you
have,
you
get
it
end
product,
then
it
is
after
standardization
you
are
treating
with
heat.
So,
after
heat
treatment
it
is
chilled
and
this
is
both
of
course,
heating
and
chilling
are
done
in
heat
exchangers;
so,
called
heat
exchanger
because
heat
exchangers
are
there
or
are
those
where
your
exchange
of
heat
is
occurring.
So,
in
chiller
or
chilling
unit
or
heater
heating
unit
both
are
in
that
way
heat
exchangers.
And
then,
you
are
after
chilling,
you
are
bringing
it
to
your
storage
place
from
where
you
are
distributed
either
through
filling
some
tanks
or
filling
some
containers
or
doing
some
packaging
depending
on
what
is
your
requirement
right.
So
with
this,
let
us
because
time
is
also
out.
So,
let
us
stop
today .
Thank
you.
