Enzymes
in
Milk
So,
we
have
finish
not
finished,
we
were
discussing
about
the
milk
enzymes,
right.
So,
now ,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology ,
lecture
number
36
we
are
discussing
about
the
enzymes
in
milk,
right.
So,
we
have
already
said
there
are
many
enzymes
present
in
milk
and
some
more
will
tell
in
detail,
right.
So,
there
are
would
there
some
few
enzymes
have
potentially
technologically
potential
rather
few
enzymes
where
we
still
that
plasmin
is
sorry
one
such
enzyme,
plasmin
is
one
such
enzyme
which
predominant
in
indigenous
proteins
in
milk
and
optimally
active
at
about
7.5
pH
and
also
at
around
37
degree
centigrade.
It
is
both
in
combination
that
pH
and
temperature
they
do
act
on
the
enzyme
accordingly ,
right.
So,
some
enzymes
are
active
at
lower
pH
some
enzymes
are
active
at
higher
pH
depending
on
that
that
also
the
temperature
and
pH
this
combination
that
helps
the
enzymes
to
act.
So,
this
is
pH
as
well
as
the
temperature
both
are
mentioned
accordingly ,
right.
So,
this
plasmin
is
such
an
enzyme
which
is
this
plasmin
and
plasminogen
or
this
plasminogen
originate
from
the
mammals
blood
and
that
predominantly
associated
with
the
casein
micelle
in
milk
used
in
cheese
ripening
and
stability
of
casein
micelle
in
UHT
milk.
So,
many
words
we
have
said,
right.
Casein
micelle
we
have
already
said.
So,
there
is
no
further
explanation
for
that.
Then
cheese
ripening
also
a
little
we
have
said
in
the
previous
class
that
when
you
are
going
into
cheese
manufacturing
then
you
will
see
that
there
are
some
unripened
and
ripened
cheese
and
the
meaning
of
ripening
also
we
have
said
in
the
previous
class
that
ripening
is
one
where
you
develop
lot
of
flavour
and
odour
in
the
in
the
prepared
cheese.
So,
this
helps
this
plasmin
helps
to
develop
such.
And
these
are
originated
from
the
mammals
blood
and
it
come
from
the
mammals
blood
and
it
is
associated
with
the
casein
micelle,
right.
It
also
tells
about
the
UHT
another
term
which
you
are
coming
across
that
is
ultra
high
temperature,
right.
W e
said
the
other
class
that
pasteurization,
right.
That
is
decomposition
of
the
pathogen
or
destruction
of
the
pathogen
pathogenic
or ganisms,
right.
So,
and
we
said
it
is
a
time
temperature
combination.
So,
always
when
you
are
you
are
heating
it
is
always
a
time
temperature
combination,
ultra
high
temperature
is
such
a
combination
where
temperature
is
raised
to
very
high
around
say
140
plus
degree
centigrade
and
it
is
for
absolutely
fraction
of
second
or
second,
right.
It
is
called
hold
no
time,
it
is
hold
at
that
temperature
and
over
so
that
means,
high
temperature
very
very
short
time
ultra
high
temperature
that
is
also
a
way
of
pasteurization,
a
mean
of
pasteurization.
Another
protein
called
another
rather
enzyme
called
lipoprotein
lipase,
right,
obviously ,
from
the
word
name
lipase
we
have
already
said,
but
lipoprotein
lipase.
That
means,
it
is
acting
on
the
lipoprotein,
right.
Lipoprotein
is
that
lipid
and
protein
together
where
there
it
is
that
is
called
lipoprotein,
right.
And
is
optimal
activity
is
around
pH
9.2
at
37
degree
centigrade
and
relatively
heat
stable
enzyme
initial
digestion
and
absorption
of
milk
lipids
in
the
intestinal
tract
and
flavour
development
in
certain
cheese
from
raw
milk
is
used,
right.
And
this
develops
hydrolytic
rancidity .
The
rancid
flavour ,
the
other
day
we
said
that
the
rancid
flavour
in
milk
is
many
times
associated
with
fishy
flavour
that
is
the
degradation
of
the
of
the
your
lipoprotein
that
is
or
phosphoprotein,
phospholipid,
that
is
your
lecithin,
right,
so
lecithin
where
it
is
there.
So,
if
that
is
degraded
if
it
is
that
is
decomposed
then
it
produces
triethylamine
or
its
derivatives,
right
which
causes
the
of f
flavour .
So,
this
lipoprotein
lipase
acts
also
on
the
lipoprotein
and
it
may
cause
hydrolytic
rancidity ,
right.So,
we
then
get
alkaline
phosphatise,
this
we
have
already
said
a
little
alkaline
phosphataase.
Phosphatase
is
one
enzyme
which
is
used
to
detect
whether
the
heat
treatment
was
suf ficient
for
pasteurization
or
not,
where
there
is
a
phosphatase
because
phosphatase
we
said
is
a
heat
stable
enzyme
or
comparative
other
enzymes
which
much
heat
stabler
and
at
high
temperature
when
you
are
pasteurising
whether
it
is
all
or ganisms
have
been
killed
or
not
is
all
pathogenic
or ganisms
are
killed
or
not.
That
is
detected
by
the
presence
of
this
enzyme
called
phosphatase.
So,
alkaline
phosphatase
in
short
alp
is
such
one
where
the
activity
is
around
9
to
10.5
pH
and
it
was
around
37
degree
centigrade.
It
is
relatively
heat
sensitive
and
its
thermal
stability
is
only
slightly
higher
than
that
of
the
non
spore
forming
thermal
stability
is
a
little
higher
than
non
spore
forming
or
pathogenic
or ganisms.
Normally
pasteurization
which
you
are
referring
all
the
time
is
killing
of
the
pathogenic
or ganisms
which
are
not
spore
former .
Because
spore
if
you
go
into
microbiology
you
will
see
that
the
bacteria
which
surrounds
it
like
a
cocoon,
right.
Like
a
cocoon
is
there
which
protects
it
this
bacteria
is
also
having
some
membrane
arounding
some
protective
cell
surrounding
it.
So,
that
this
is
becoming
very
very
stable
that
spore
formers
are
very
very
then
dangerous.
So,
we
are
referring
to
all
the
time
is
the
pathogenic
or ganisms
which
are
not
spore
former ,
so
not;
this
enzyme
is
little
more
resistant
to
heat
than
the
non
spore
former
pathogenic
or ganisms,
right.
That
is
why
it
is
choosen
as
one
of
the
indicator
whether
you
are
this
heat
treatment
was
suf ficient
or
not,
right.
So,
this
is
the
indicator
of
pasteurization
ef ficiency .
Then
another
enzyme
called
sulfhydryl
oxidase,
sulfhydryl
oxidase,
right.
This
is
catalyzes
oxidation
of
thioles
and
formation
of
disulfide
bonds
in
proteins
peptides
in
proteins
and
peptides.
W e
have
already
said
this
is
not
new
that
proteins
what
peptides
what
that
we
have
already
discussed,
so
no
more.
Sulfhydryl
oxidase
treated
UHT
milk
may
have
longer
flavour
retention
ability
due
to
reduced
lipid
as
rather
lipid
oxidation,
right.
So,
if
you
have
sulfhydryl
oxidase
it
helps
in
developing
flavour
in
UHT
the
reason
being
the
lipids
which
are
degraded
by
oxidation
that
is
not
there,
right,
so
that
is
reduced.
So,
that
is
the
reason
why
some
good
flavour
can
be
written
in
the
UHT
when
this
sulphide
oxidase
catalyze
oxidation
of
thiols
for
forming
disulfide
bonds,
right.
So,
that
is
forming
some
flavour
producing
components
not
the
oxidation
of
the
lipid.
Then
lactoperoxidase,
right,
peroxidise
we
had
said
earlier
that
is
the
oxidation
oxidative
enzyme
which
catalyzes
and
by
the
by
enzymes
are
catalyst,
right.
That
we
know
that
enzymes
are
catalyst,
it
acts
as
a
catalyst
for
any
reaction
whether
good
or
bad
in
a
material.
So,
it
acts
as
a
catalyst,
so
in
lactoperoxidase
it
is
relatively
heat
stable
milk
enzyme
it
requires
80
degree
centigrade
for
thermal
inactivation
and
antibacterial
agent
which
works
around
pH
8
and
exists
primarily
in
milk
serum,
milk
serum
already
we
have
said
where
that
distinction
between
serum
then
your
plasma
all
this
things
we
have
said
earlier ,
right.
So,
it
requires
80
degree
centigrade
for
thermal
inactivation
and
it
is
a
antibacterial
agent,
right,
lipo,
lipo
sorry
lactoperoxidase
there
is
anti
antibacterial
agent,
right.
So,
it
is
more
heat
stable
that
is
deactivated
around
80
degree
centigrade.
So,
high
temperature
it
can
withstand,
right.
That
is
why
it
is
in
UHT
also.
Then
N-acetyl-p-D-glucosaminide
glucosaminidase,
right,
glucosaminidase
N-acetyl-p-D-glucose
glucosaminidase,
right;
glucosaminidase,
that
is
activity
diagnosed
for
for
mastitis
rather
mastitis
that
doctors
do
tell
mastitis,
right.
That
is
nothing
but,
that
that
is
nothing
but
that
the
infection
at
the
udder ,
right,
infection
at
the
udder
of
the
animal
that
is
called
mastitis,
right,
by
the
doctors.
So,
this
is
one
term
which
we
have
not
come
across
the
mastitis
it
is
the
infection
of
the
udder .
So,
that
infection
of
the
other
can
be
can
be
identified
by
the
presence
of
this
N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase,
right.
Then
catalase
another
enzyme
which
is
associated
with
somatic
cell
membrane
somatic
cell
we
have
already
said
somatic
cell
membrane
this
is
associated
with
that
catalyse,
right.
So,
somatic
cell
membrane
can
be
that
catalyse
we
have
said
earlier
is
the
oxidative
enzyme.
Xanthine
oxidase
it
contains
all
of
the
molybdenum
in
milk
xanthine
oxidase,
whatever
molybdenum
present
in
milk
it
is
there
in
xanthine
oxidase.
So,
this
is
all
molybdenum
in
milk
is
available
in
xanthine
oxidase
then
superoxide
dismutase
superoxide,
dismutase
not
di
sorry
dismutase
superoxide
dismutase
this
is
a
protein,
this
is
a
protective
ef fect
on
lipid
oxidation.
So,
on
lipid
oxidation
this
acts
as
a
protection
that
superoxide
dismutase.
Then
gamma
glutamyltransferase,
gamma
glutamyltransferase
it
transports
amino
acids
into
memory
gland.
Amino
acids
are
transferred
to
memory
glands
or
that
glands
from
where
the
milk
is
secreted,
that
transport
of
amino
acid
that
is
being
done
by
this
enzyme
called
gamma
glutamyl
glutamyltransferase.
Then
gamma
lactose
synthase
gamma
lactose
synthase
it
acts
for
synthesis
of
the
lactose
that
is
gamma
lactose
synthase.
So,
all
these
are
intrinsic
in
milk
it
is
there
and
we
have
discussed
mostly
that
these
enzymes
help
dif ferently
in
dif ferent
formation
or
destruction
of
some
good
or
some
bad
of
the
milk,
right.
So,
enzymes
do
have
lot
of
activities
in
milk
and
there
are
as
we
said
20-20
enzymes
have
been
characterized
from
the
milk
and
40
other
have
been
identified
as
their
activity
or
from
their
activity
in
milk
the
result
indicates
that
these
are
these
enzymes
those
are
under
that
40
category .
So,
so
many
enzymes
are
present
in
milk
which
directly
or
indirectly
helping
or
destroying
depending
on
the
enzyme,
depending
on
the
use
for
the
milks
which
we
have
come
across,
right.Then
we
come
to
vitamins
there
are
lot
many
vitamins
are
there,
right.
From
vitamin
A
vitamin
B
2
or
vitamin
B’ s,
right.
V itamin
B’ s
that
is
vitamin
B
1
as
thiamine,
vitamin
B
2
or
G
as
riboflavin
nicotinic
acid
as
niacin
vitamin
B
6
as
pyridoxin
pantothenic
acid,
vitamin
C
as
ascorbic
acid,
vitamin
D
vitamin
E
as
alpha
tocopherol
and
vitamin
K
all
these
vitamins
are
present
in
milk,
all
these
vitamins
are
present
in
milk
and
we
get
vitamins
out
of
that,
right.
All
these
vitamins
are
present
in
milk
that
is
vitamin
A
vitamin,
B
1
as
thiamine,
vitamin
B
2
or
G
as
riboflavin
nicotinic
acid
as
niacin,
vitamin
B
6
as
pyridoxin
pantothanic
acid,
vitamin
C
ascorbic
acid,
vitamin
D
vitamin
E
that
is
as
alpha
tocopherol,
and
vitamin
K
out
of
which
some
are
fat
soluble
and
some
are
water
soluble.
Fat
solubles
are
vitamin
A,
D,
E
and
K
and
rest
of
the
vitamins
are
water
soluble,
right.
So,
these
are
all
vitamins
which
are
available
in
milk.
But
it
is
poor
in
vitamin
C
content,
right.
It
is
poor
in
vitamin
C
content.
Y ou
see
it
could
have
been
more,
but
nature
this
is
a
natural
products
nature
has
made
in
such
way
vitamin
C
normally
it
is
this
to
ascorbic
acid.
So,
this
is
acid
component.
So,
had
it
been
high
then
that
would
have
disturbed
the
pH
of
the
milk
and
thereby
that
the
coagulation
or
the
stability
of
the
casein
in
colloidal
form
that
would
have
been
disturbed.
So,
nature
has
not
given
that
ascorbic
acid
so
much
in
vitamin
in
milk,
right.
So,
nature
is
such
a
beautiful
thing
that
it
controls
everything
and
with
all
reasoning
with
all
scientific
reasoning
it
is
there
and
I
really
appreciate
I
am
amazed
that
how
nature
takes
care
of
everything,
right.
That
is
whether
it
is
good
or
whether
it
is
bad
doesn’ t
matter ,
but
accordingly
nature
takes
care.
So,
here
that
example
we
have
given
that
vitamin
E
or
tocopherol
or
sorry
vitamin
C
not
tocopherol
vitamin
C
or
ascorbic
acid
tocopherol
is
another
which
is
known
as
the
antioxidant,
right.
W e
have
lot
of
fats
in
vitamin.
So,
antioxidants
as
antioxidant
this
tocopherol
is
used,
right.
And
many
many
drugs
do
have
this
vitamin
E
and
is
tocopherol
as
antioxidant
and
that
is
why
milk
also
do
have
lot
of
vitamin
E
and
it
is
good
to
protect
the
fat
as
antioxidant,
right.
Whereas,
the
other
one
vitamin
C
is
very
poor
in
milk
as
well
iron
I
am
not
sure
about
the
why
iron
is
so
poor
in
milk
that
why
nature
has
made
such,
but
definitely
there
is
some
reasoning
for
that.
Y es,
iron
makes
the
heme
or
it
can
act
with
haemoglobin
and
may
come
out
I
am
not
sure
about
that,
but
definitely
some
reasoning
is
also
there
why
iron
is
so
low
in
milk
whereas,
so
many
other
things
are
so
high
but
iron
is
also
low ,
right.
So,
must
have
been
some
reasoning
good
reasoning
for
nature
to
substantiate
the
reason
why
it
is
not
present,
ok.
Some
gases
are
also
there
like
a
milk
contains
around
7
to
10
percent
by
volume
of
gas,
where
on
7
to
10
percent
by
volume
of
gas
around
that
carbon
dioxide
comes
from
udder ,
the
udder
when
it
is
being
milked
carbon
dioxide
do
come
from
there.
Nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
taking
during
milking
on
standing
the
amount
of
gas
becomes
less,
right.
So,
when
milking
is
being
done
that
time
lot
of
incorporation
of
either
air
from
there
maybe
carbon
dioxide,
maybe
nitro
dissolve
nitrogen
or
oxygen
gases
are
there
is
dissolved
oxygen
concentration
for
amount
or
quantity
is
diluted
when
you
are
standing
from
some
time
then
it
comes
out,
right.
As
we
know
that
the
this
solution
of
or
rather
the
solution
of
the
gases
is
a
function
of
temperature
also,
right.
So,
the
lower
the
temperature,
lower
is
the
solubility
the
higher
the
temperature
more
is
the
solubility .
Is
it
true
that
with
high
temperature
within
the
derive
oxygen
or
gases
do
enter
no
it
is
the
other
way ,
right.
It
is
the
other
way ,
right.
That
is
why
it
is
the
other
way
that
is
why
in
drinks
cold
drinks
typically
when
you
are
putting
that
cold
drink
you
see
you
are
putting
in
refrigerator .
Why?
Because
those
carbon
dioxide
which
are
put
into
this
cold
drink,
if
at
high
temperature
that
has
come
though
it
is
sealed.
But
it
at
high
temperature
it
has
come
up
and
because
of
the
temperature
dissolution
has
happen
it
is
of
the
surface
of
this
content
or
container ,
and
when
you
are
putting
back
in
the
in
the
refrigerator
this
goes
back
into
the
solution
and
then
you
get
the
flavour
you
get
the
you
get
the
pleasure
of
carbon
dioxide
being
inside,
right.
So,
it
is
that
the
lower
the
temperature
solubility
is
more
the
higher
thetemperature
now
the
solubility
of
the
gas
is
less
this
is
by
enlar ge
exceptions
are
also
there,
right.
Now
we
come
to
the
absolutely
concluding
part
of
the
milk
constituents
that
what
milk
is
made
of.
V itamins
we
have
already
said,
gases
we
have
already
said.
Some
non
protein
nitrogen
substances
are
also
there
like
urea,
amins,
creatinine,
creatine,
uric
acid,
adenine,
guanine
ranging
from
1.5
to
10
parts
per
million,
right.
So,
we
come
to
this
level
that
milk
comprised
of
one
side
it
is
water
and
another
side
it
is
total
solids,
out
of
that
total
solids
it
is
part
is
fat
which
is
lipid
and
out
of
that
some
are
true
fat
that
is
several
fatty
acids,
are
fatty
glycerides
and
some
associated
substance.
Some
associated
substances
are
like
phospholipids
or
lecithin
cholesterol
then
carotene
then
vitamins
like
A
D
E
and
K,
right.
This
is
one
part.
And
in
total
solid
another
part
is
total
solid
is
not
fat
that
is
solid
not
fat,
so
these
solid
not
fat
includes
all
rest
of
the
other
material.
And
that
is
the
solid
not
fat
is
this
that
this
solid
not
fat
is
lactose
that
is
sugar
or
nitrogenous
substances
or
mineral
matters
or
some
other
constituents.
In
lactose
it
is
only
the
milk
sugar
then
nitrogenous
substances
out
of
which
it
is
non
protein
substances
like
urea,
amines,
creatine,
creatinine,
uric
acid,
adenine,
guanine
etcetera.
In
protein
that
is
nitrogenous
substances
it
is
casein
alpha
beta
gamma,
this
casein
then
lactalbumin
or
alpha
lactalbumin,
right,
then
lactoglobullin,
that
is
beta
lactoglobullin
and
proteose
or
peptone,
right,
proteose
or
peptone.
And
in
mineral
matters
we
get
phosphoric
phosphates
citrates
chlorides
of
sodium,
potassium,
calcium,
magnesium
and
traces
of
iron
copper
and
iodine.
Whereas,
in
some
other
constituents
we
get
some
pigments,
some
dissolved
gases,
some
beta
B
complexes
and
vitamin
C
some
enzymes
and
bacteria.
So,
it
contains
everything
it
contains
everything.
So,
that
is
why
milk
if
it
is
studied,
if
there
is
that
liquid
food
is
studied
you
come
across
with
lot
of
chemistry
and
physics
and
associated
things
of
food,
ok.
So,
hopefully
we
have
covered
lot
in,
we
have
covered
lot
in
milk
constituents
and
next
we
will
follow
as
we
have
given
the
outline.
Thank
you.
