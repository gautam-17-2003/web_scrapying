Constituents
of
Milk
In
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
our
course
title
as
and
when
I
am
coming
and
saying
that
if
it
is
possible
for
us
to
encompass
as
much
as
we
can,
because
though
there
is
no
preamble
for
this
course,
but
definitely
some
kind
of
knowledge
in
a
chemistry
food
chemistry
these
things
are
also
required
right.
I
said
that
engineering
I
the
other
day
I
said
if
you
are
interested
already
we
have
done
on
momentum
transfer .
So,
you
can
also
take
that
course
or
register
yourself.
Then
future
also
many
such
courses
will
come
up
which
will
encompass
many
of
the
engineering
site,
but
simultaneously
like
technological
or
science
based
topic
or
subject
like
this
one,
that
also
require
some
basic
science
knowledge
like
chemistry
some
physics,
chemistry
and
mathematics
is
always
all
the
time.
So,
that
is
why
I
think
as
and
when
possible
whenever
things
are
coming
I
am
trying
my
best
to
explain
a
little
bit
more
or
encompass
a
little
bit
more
such
that
you
can
easily
understand,
easily
correlate,
easily
rather
express
yourself
in
that
way.
So,
here
also
we
will
do
similar
things
like
that
now
we
are
in
the
milk
constituents
right,
earlier
we
have
seen
what
happens,
what
is
the
taste,
what
is
the
color ,
what
happens
when
acidification
is
made
etcetera,
some
of
the
things
which
you
have
done.
Now ,
let
us
go
into
the
bit
further
detail
of
the
constituents
of
milk
right.
So,
that
is
our
headline
today
that
constituents
of
milk
this
on
lecture
19
will
do
right.You
know
we
have
said
in
the
previous
class
that
depending
on
the
source
depending
on
the
depending
on
the
species
you
are
considering,
it
may
have
wide
variation
of
the
constituents
like
the
basic
constituents
which
are
the
basic
of
the
nutrients
that
water ,
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate,
vitamins,
minerals
all
these
are
constituents
of
any
food
product
it
is
not
that
all
the
time.
Now ,
since
we
are
talking
about
milk
it
is
not
necessarily
that
we
will
talk
about
milk
only
and
other
food
products
if
we
come
across
we
will
keep
it
aside.
So,
that
is
why
when
in
general
we
are
saying
so,
these
all
constituents
are
the
basic
constituents
of
any
food
it
may
be
somewhere
one
of
the
or
some
of
the
constituents
are
predominant
somewhere
others
are
very
nominal
or
negligible
or
may
be
very
very
I
don’t
say
that
it
is
absolutely
0,
but
very
very
in
significant
in
quantity .
So,
in
that
case
whenever
we
are
coming
into
all
of
them
we
will
definitely
try
to
explain
some
more
chemistry
associated
with
them
right
this
I
think
it
is
better
we
do
it.
Otherwise
understanding
because
some
of
the
chemistries
are
also
required,
I
am
not
saying
that
chemical
formulae
or
chemical
reactions
understanding
of
the
chemistry
basic
chemistry
also
required
right,
like
if
I
tell
you
that
glycerol,
glycerol
is
what,
try
to
recapitulate
glycerol
is
yes
you
are
right
trihydroxy
alcohol
right
trihydroxy
alcohol;
that
means,
there
are
3
hydroxyl
groups
not
only
there
and
this
3
hydroxyl
groups
are
connected
to
3
carbons
right
that
is
why
glycerol
is
a
3
carbon
member .
So,
like
this
if
some
basic
things
come
up
as
and
when
we
will
try
to
encompass
we
will
try
to
cover
whenever
it
is
possible
we
will
try
to
again
minimize
if
there
be
any
repetition,
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
remember
that
which
one
was
already
told
then
which
one
was
not.
So,
had
it
been
in
the
same
class
in
a
single
class
then
you
can
remember
within
all
the
number
of
classes
it
is
very
difficult
to
remember
which
one
has
already
been
told
a
little
or
in
detail
and
which
one
not,
but
we
will
try
as
much
as
we
can
remember
and
minimize
the
repetition
if
there
be
any
hopefully
it
will
not
be,
but
okay
and
some
of
the
repetitions
are
also
helpful
for
you
because
that
gives
you
recapitulation
of
the
first.
So,
it
is
call
brushing
up.
So,
little
brushing
up
it
happens
and
that
helps
in
our
experiences
that
helps
in
a
memorizing
because
many
things
are
not
possible
to
memorize,
but
there
are
some
things
which
hit
on
your
brain
or
in
your.
So,
called
in
calical
language
you
call
head
so,
that
goes
to
the
head
and
normally
you
do
not
forget.
The
basic
constituents
start
with
the
water
hopefully
in
the
last
class
we
started
it
little
and
because
of
the
time
constraint
we
could
not
carry
forward
and
milk
it
contains
between
80
to
90
percent
water
in
general
it
can
be
little
bit
more
or
little
bit
less
depending
on
this
species
depending
on
the
places
from
where
etcetera,
etcetera
many
many
factors
are
there
right.
Again
I
will
said
that
what
are
the
results
for
this
different
output
of
the
different
mammals
what
are
the
different
reasons,
we
will
try
again
sometime
once
we
finish
all
these
constituents
and
others
is
activities
then
we
will
go
and
with
those
also
because
that
is
also
an
thing
which
is
required
and
perhaps
there
we
will
tell
little
bit
more
about
the
colostrum
which
we
said
the
other
day,
that
is
the
basic
of
the
of
the
all
newly
borned
baby
which
is
supplied,
which
who
is
supplied
rather
who
is
supplied
with
the
with
the
fighting
ability
with
the
new
environment
that
is
all
kinds
of
supporting
mechanisms
or
all
kinds
of
aglorimization
mechanisms
to
help
them
some
of
the
things
come
from
there
which
we
will
tell
in
detail
when
we
go
for
that
colostrum.
Now ,
the
basic
part
is
it
is
with
water
80
to
90
percent
is
water
and
in
that
water
small
quantity
of
water
is
also
associated
with
hydration
of
different
salts
different
proteins
different
in
a
different
way
different
hydration
this
is
called
binding
of
water
chemically
with
different
molecules
like
lactose
salt
or
protein
all
these
do
have
hydration
and
hydration
the
other
day
I
said.
We
also
said
about
the
water
activity
your
milk
also
has
a
very
high
water
activity
around
0.9
9
more
than
0.
9
9
and
we
said
about
the
water
activity
the
other
day
right.Now;
obviously ,
the
higher
the
water
content
more
is
the
water
activity
and
higher
the
water
activity
more
is
the
chance
of
microbial
spoilage
or
microbes
to
invent
and
act
on
the
material
whatever
it
be,
whether
it
is
milk
or
either
it
is
any
solid
food
everywhere
it
is
same
right.
If
the
moisture
content
is
very
high
it
is
susceptible
to
be
or
liable
to
be
invaded
by
micro
organisms,
now
which
micro
organisms
from
where
will
come
that
is
altogether
different
and
there
is
not
also
under
this
umbrella
of
a
or
jurisdiction
of
this
course.
But
still
when
as
and
when
we
come
across
will
definitely
tell
like,
typically
if
we
consider
milk
it
is
the
major
where
the
lactobacillus
as
the
genes
right
again
here
I
will
not
go
into
detail
of
the
microbiology
because
which
is
genes
which
is
species
etcetera
this
if
we
go
on
again
digging
into
that
then
no
into
that.
So,
I
presume
that
at
least
we
understand
that
lactobacillus
is
the
genes
from
their
different
species
like
genes
means
is
family ,
is
the
family
and
like
in
the
family
different
persons
are
there
as
the
individual.
So,
like
that
different
species
are
there
in
that
genes
and
they
constitute
to
the
whole
family
genus.
So,
this
lactobacillus
genus
is
definitely
act
on
the
milk
and
they
are
very
much
liking
milk
as
the
source.
It
does
not
mean
others
do
not
because
milk
is
a
very
good
source
of
all
the
ingredients
all
the
nutrients
required
for
the
organisms
to
grow
since
it
is
available.
So,
everybody
would
try
to,
but
as
we
know
from
the
microbiological
point
of
view
that
typically
for
bacteria
there
are
basically
three
types
one
is
thermophilic,
one
is
mesophilic
and
one
is
psychrophilic.
So,
depending
on
that
temperature
what
is
the
temperature
at
which
you
are
keeping
organisms
will
come
accordingly
also,
that
is
also
a
restricting
point
or
some
point
where
you
can
demarked.
So,
if
the
water
activity
is
high
chances
of
getting
contaminated
or
spoilage
is
very
high
to
make
it
more
stable
normally
what
you
do
for
any
food
material
you
remove
the
water
that
is
by
removal
of
moisture
this
is
a
very
good
technique
which
we
normally
called
drying.
So,
in
this
typical
for
milk
it
is
dried
to
the
powder
level
where
the
moisture
content
is
very
low
much
below
then
water
activity
level
of
0.6
right
and
we
said
the
other
day
0.7
is
the
datum,
for
most
of
the
organisms
like
a
including
mold,
but
accessions
are
there
that
is
why
if
we
take
0.6
as
a
lower
side,
then
hopefully
if
things
are
below
the
0.6
what
activity
then
organism
growth
or
contamination
with
respect
to
organisms
are
minimized
or
can
be
avoided
right.So,
if
that
be
true
then
you
this
water
if
that
is
removed
and
brought
down
to
the
level
which
is
less
than
0.6,
which
is
true
with
milk
powder
when
we
are
making
powder
from
milk.
Normally ,
this
milk
powder
is
done
with
spray
drying
and
this
spray
dried
milk
powder
contains
around
2.53
percent
not
more
than
that
moisture
right;
though
since
it
has
also
sugar
that
too
lactose.
So,
it
is
also
hydroscopic
it
can
absorb
from
ambient
moisture
and
that
you
have
to
take
care
that
is
why
you
will
see
that
I
do
not
know
how
many
times
you
have
seen
that
whenever
this
bottles
or
this
the
containers
from
where
this
dried
power
milk
is
taken
the
then
either
mummy
or
seniors
do
tell
put
the
lid
closed.
The
moment
it
is
then
normally ,
they
do
not
keep
it
open
for
long
because
by
the
time
it
will
grab
some
moisture
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
and
it
will
get
moisten
and
local
moisture
will
grow
up
and
that
may
lead
to
some
contamination
right.
It
is
not
necessarily
that
in
the
whole
container
of
dried
milk
that
the
entire
milk
has
to
be
hydrated
or
it
should
adhere
moisture
and
increase
the
moisture
level
then
only
organisms
will
come
it
is
not,
see
if
a
small
portion
inside
is
getting
moisture
absorb
and
local
moisture
there
it
that
becomes
more
than
the
critical
level
of
the
water
activity .
Then
either
organisms
can
come
and
grow
into
that
or
invent
it
is
not
that
coming
like
that
we
go
from
here
to
there
it
is
always
all
the
time
everywhere
we
are
not
able
to
see,
but
that
why
it
is
micro
and
since
we
are
not
able
to
see
and
since
they
are
coming
they
are
they
can
this
is
called
invading.
So,
they
are
invading
and
they
can
grow
and
spoil,
but
normally
it
is
chances
are
low
and
don’t
say
rare
low
because
you
then
take
care
of
it
is
not
that
it
comes
in
atmosphere
and
all
the
moisture
from
that
atmosphere
goes
we
because
here
also
then
it
comes
to
that
heat
and
mass
transfer
that
those
concepts
right.
So,
it
is
not
just
like
that
it
goes
from
moisture
and
all
moisture
from
the
atmosphere
goes
into
the
product
and
spoils
that
it
is
not
it
takes
also
time
that
is
why
after
taking
it
is
getting
closed
right
sorry
I
am
so,
sorry .
Normally
this
is
one
way
of
extending
the
life
of
milk
by
making
it
dried
product
and
milk
powder
is
the
best
example
of
that
by
removal
of
moisture.
So,
it
is
coming
under
the
umbrella
of
moisture,
another
one
is
definitely
very
very
useful
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
law
that
you
are
not
allowed
to
add
externally
water
without
the
knowledge
of
the
customer .If
customer
says
or
you
are
the
customer
if
you
for
your
consumption
if
you
think
that
I
will
dilute
it
no
problem
I
will
concentrated
it
no
problem
it
is
your.
Your
baby
you
can
do
anything
you
like,
but
the
seller
they
cannot.
So,
it
is
not
recommended
that
external
addition
of
moisture
to
the
milk
it
should
be
there
so,
that
is
prohibited
right
by
the
law.
Now ,
we
come
to
the
from
the
first
constituent
water
the
next
constituent
as
fats
and
lipids
right,
next
constituent
we
come
to
fats
and
lipids
here
I
would
like
to
spend
some
time
on
fats
and
lipids
what
is
that
right
perhaps
in
one
of
the
class
I
said
that
all
lipids
are
not
fat,
but
all
fats
are
lipids
right.
So,
lipids
are
what,
lipids
are
insoluble
in
water ,
but
soluble
in
non
polar
solvents
all
lipids
are
insoluble
in
water ,
but
soluble
in
non
because
water
is
a
polar
solvent
that
is
why
in
milk
that
fat
milk
fat
is
not
in
solution
because
it
does
not
go
into
solution.
So,
it
is
not
soluble
in
water ,
but
soluble
in
non
polar
solvents
like
organic
solvents
they
are
soluble
such
as
chloroform,
carbon,
disulfide,
benzene,
hexane,
ether
etcetera.
The
characteristics
solubility
of
lipids
in
water
is
in
several
cases
due
to
the
presence
in
them
of
one
or
more
fatty
acids
this
solubility
is
a
function
of
the
presence
of
one
or
more
fatty
acids
and
in
that
we
will
come
in
detail
in
that
fatty
acids
which
contain
long
aliphatic
hydrocarbon
chains
right.
So,
depending
on
how
long
or
how
small
the
chains
are
solubility
also
may
differ
right;
obviously ,
you
can
imagine
that
a
big
fat
chain
or
long
chain
aliphatic
fatty
acid
the
that
when
it
goes
to
the
solution;
that
means,
it
has
to
go
into
the
water
and
in
a
way
either
hydration
or
some
a
similar
things
can
be
done.
So,
one
molecule
may
not
be
good
enough
to
hold
that
entire
big
molecule
of
the
fatty
acids.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
expected
that
high
molecular
weight
fatty
acids
or
long
chain
fatty
acids
their
solubility
will
be
much
lower
than
that
of
the
smaller
molecular
weight
or
smaller
chain
fatty
acids
right.
Then
lipids
are
widely
distributed
in
nature
they
really
occurred
in
an
organism
in
the
free
state,
but
are
more
usually
combined
with
proteins
as
lipoproteins
or
carbohydrates
as
lyposaccharides
or
glycolipids
liposaccharide
or
it
may
be
also
called
glycolipids.
So,
these
are
they
are
not
available
in
the
free
state
as
the
lipid.
So,
they
are
always
associated
with
either
some
protein
or
carbohydrate
so,
depending
on
that
it
may
be
termed
as
either
lipoprotein
or
glycoprotein
or
lyposaccharide
etcetera
etcetera
right.
So,
they
are
not
available
in
the
free
state
this
statement
is
very
very
important
that
they
are
not
available
in
the
free
state
always
associated
with
others
like
proteins
like
carbohydrates,
they
are
always
associated
as
lipoprotein
or
liposaccharide.
Now ,
if
we
classify
lipids
it
can
be
classified
in
two
groups,
one
is
simple
and
the
other
is
compound;
obviously ,
simple
is
the
one
where
fatty
acid
that
is
the
fats
which
are
esters
of
fatty
acids
with
glycerol
right
and
or
waxes,
glycerol’ s
and
waxes.
So,
which
are
esters
of
fatty
acids
with
long
chain
monohydroxy
alcohols
all
other
lipids
are
compound
lipids
such
as
phosphoglycerides
or
phospholipids
or
phosphatide,
steriods,
carotenoids
and
lipids
functioning
as
vitamins
or
hormones.
They
are
all
complex
if
possible
sometime
will
also
show
some
may
be
one
or
two
this
figure
which
may
be
very
very
required
right.
So,
in
that
case
what
I
mean
to
say
that
those
which
are
glycerides.
So,
glycerol
so,
let
me
open
a
open
a
page
glycerol
or
I
can
use
this
much
this
much
is
good
enough
that
it
is
CH
2
OH
CH
OH
CH
2
OH
so,
this
is
the
glycerol
right.
So,
it
has
3
hydroxyl
groups
right
one
in
the
top
second
in
the
bottom
and
third
in
the
middle
right.
So,
all
these
hydroxyl
groups
if
they
are
and
we
also
know
that
this
is
the
hydroxyl,
hydroxyl
group
is
what,
OH
group
is
hydroxyl
group
and
one
it
is
reacting
with
CO
OH
this
is
the
carboxylic
group
right.
So,
when
this
hydroxylic
group
and
the
carboxylic
group
they
are
reacting
then
what
happens,
one
molecule
of
water
goes
away
and
there
it
forms
ester.
So,
ester
means
through
O
right
this
kind
of
reaction
happens
and
when
it
is
happening
that
time
definitely
we
can
call
it
depending
on
whether
single
hydroxyl
group
is
a
stratified
or
2
hydroxyl
groups
are
esterified
or
all
3
hydroxyl
groups
are
a
esterified,
if
it
is
single
hydroxyl
group
then
we
call
it
to
be
and
these
are
all
compounds
of
glycerol
salt
compounds
of
glycerol
with
the
acid.
So,
or
esters
of
the
glycerol
so,
in
that
case
if
it
is
only
one
hydroxyl
group
then
we
will
we
call
it
to
be
mono
glyceride,
if
it
is
with
the
2
then
we
call
it
to
be
diglyceride
and
if
it
is
all
with
3
then
we
call
triglyceride
and
you
remember
in
the
first
class
in
milk
we
had
said
that
almost
around
98
percent
is
out
of
the
fats
in
milk
almost
around
98
percent
of
them
are
in
the
form
of
triglycerides
right.
So,
mono
di
may
or
may
not
be
there
depending
on
it
is
I
am
not
talking
about
milk
in
general
mono
or
di
glycerides
may
or
may
not
be
there,
but
that
also
constitutes
the
fat.
So,
the
fats
are
when
we
are
getting
the
hydroxyl
groups
of
the
triglycerides
esterified
with
a
fatty
acid
then
that
becomes
the
mono
or
di
or
tri
hydroglyceride
right.
So,
depending
on
that
mono
or
di
or
triglycerides
we
call
it
to
be
the
glycerides
or
gliss
simple
fat
simple
fats
right.
And
we
also
said
that
the
complex
fats
are
those
which
are
associate
with
either
very
very
long
chain
carboxylic
acids
or
maybe
not
directly
associated
may
be
associated
with
some
other
proteins
or
lipids
proteins
or
carbohydrates
like
sterols,
then
we
said
carotenoids,
then
lipids
functioning
as
vitamins
or
hormones
all
these
are
complex
or
compound
lipids
simple
lipid
is
the
mono
or
di
or
triglycerides
of
glycerol
with
fatty
acids
right.
Foods
generally
contain
any
or
all
of
these
lipids
our
main
interest
is
on
fats
that
is
acylglycerides
now
the
acylglycerols
or
triglycerides
acylglycerols
or
triglycerides,
noanother
new
word
has
come
up
I
can
skip
right
acyl
what
does
it
mean
right
acyl.
So,
here
it
is
with
O
and
here
with
R
and
it
could
be
any
other
thing.
So,
this
could
be
normally
with
the
methyl
group
or
any
such
substitute
anti
carbons
right
so,
then
it
is
called
acyl
right
so,
that
acyl
hydro
compounds
are
acylglycerols
or
triglycerides
are
there
phospholipids
are
also
there.
So,
fat
where
all
are
triglycerides
regardless
of
whether
they
are
normally
non
liquid
or
liquid
at
room
temperatures
right.
So,
all
fats
are
fat
all
triglycerides
regardless
of
whether
they
are
normally
non
liquid
or
liquid
at
room
temperature
they
are
fat,
I
said
the
other
day
the
difference
between
fat
and
oil
primarily
is
that
that
fat
is
solid
at
room
temperature
and
oil
is
liquid
at
room
temperature
this
is
by
and
large
general
classification
or
general
distinction
between
the
fat
and
oil.
So,
fats
are
solid
at
room
temperature
and
now;
obviously ,
room
temperature
which
one
you
call
because
room
temperature
cannot
be
uniformly
same
all
over
the
world
somewhere
it
is
20
degree,
somewhere
it
is
10
degree,
somewhere
it
is
30
degree,
somewhere
it
is
0,
depending
on
the
location,
depending
on
the
places,
but
by
and
large
room
temperature
we
call
to
be
somewhere
close
to
20
right,
by
all
means
it
can
be
taken
as.
So,
around
20
if
they
are
solid
then
normally
it
is
fat,
if
they
are
liquid
then
normal
it
is
oil
right.
We
will
not
see
that
even
in
very
winter
the
oil
which
you
have
bought
from
the
market
for
domestic
preparation
or
domestic
consumption
those
oils
do
not
get
certified
right,
those
they
don’t
get
frozen
right
because
their
freezing
point
could
be
much
much
lower .
So,
that
is
why
they
are
not
solid
at
even
very
at
even
winter
or
low
temperature
right
whereas,
fat
what
do
you
called
to
be
the
solid
if
they
are
somewhere
is
at
the
high
summer
peak
summer
could
be
going
into
the
liquid
phase,
because
they
can
be
melted
at
even
at
40,
45
degree
centigrade
they
can
be
even
melted.
So,
there
and
you
if
you
take
a
little
fat
to
say
butter
in
your
fingertip
and
keep
it
for
some
time
you
will
see
that
it
started
melting
because
your
body
temperature
is
somewhere
37
degree
plus
minus
37
degree
so,
at
that
temperature
this
starts
getting
melted.
This
you
can
try
may
not
be
in
winter
because
in
winter
your
body
temperature
external
not
internal
external
maybe
somewhat
low
because
of
the
surrounding
temperature
right,
but
even
then
if
you
keep
for
sometime
it
will
get
the
circulation
blood
circulation,
and
the
temperature
will
be
automatically
maintained
and
in
that
case
they
are
also
it
may
take
somemore
time
and
it
will
be
melted
right.
So,
you
have
to
be
careful
that
which
one
to
be
fat,
which
one
to
be
oil,
those
which
are
solid
at
room
temperature
fats,
those
which
are
liquid
at
room
temperature
are
oil
ok.
So,
we
have
no
more
time
today .
So
we
will
continue
in
the
next
class.
Thank
you.
