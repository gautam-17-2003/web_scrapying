Temperatur e
Quotient
and
Its
Impact
In
the
previous
class
we
said
about
a
blanching
and
pasteurization
and
its
effectiveness
etcetera,
and
there
if
you
remember
we
had
said
that
the
term
called
temperature
quotient
is
very
applicable,
and
today
we
will
discuss
more
on
that
and
see
how
effective
this
can
give
you
some
of
the
application
.
Though
quickly
in
that
previous
class
we
could
not
finish
that
some
processes
like
called
canning
or
appertization,
where
high
temperature
is
being
used
right
to
not
only
destroyed
that
pathogens,
but
also
many
organisms
right.

So,
here
we
come
to
that
what
is
the
called
term
called
temperature
quotient
right,
and
this
why
it
is
coming
because
earlier
we
had
been
dealing
with
the
we
said
that
high
temperature
was
applied.
Now ,
if
it
is
low
temperature
why
the
difference
will
be
there
right,
so
to
understand
that
if
we
understand
the
term
called
temperature
quotient
or
Q
10
right
that
is
called
temperature
quotient.
So,
this
temperature
quotient
is
defined
as
ùêæ ùëá+10ùêæ ùëá
Where
K
is
the
reaction
rate
.
You
remember
in
earlier
some
class,
which
also
said
that
all
whether
we
are
dealing
with
food
right
whether
we
are
consuming
or
processing
in
any
cases,
in
many
cases
things
are
associated
with
biochemical
reactions
right,
and
that
is
not
under
the
purview
of
this
course.
But
to
have
some
test
to
have
some
idea
about
that
we
will
as
and
when
required
we
will
bring
also
into
it.
So,
that
we
feel
that
where
it
is
needed
right.
Now ,
this
temperature
quotient
Q
10
is
K
is
the
rate
of
reaction
and
this
reaction
can
be
as
you
said
earlier
also
that
any
reaction
like
chemical
reaction,
biochemical
reaction,
microbial
reaction,
enzymatic
reaction
any
kind
of
reactions
is
generally
following
this
straight
forward
relationship
that
temperature
quotient
(Q
10
).
2
So,
this
physically
means
that
if
you
increase
the
temperature
by
10
¬∞C,
then
the
rates
of
reaction
is
doubled
or
if
you
decrease
the
temperature
by
10
¬∞C,
the
rest
of
reaction
is
half.
Say
if
we
take
the
room
temperature
say
30
¬∞C
and
if
we
increase
the
temperature
by
10
¬∞C,
then
temperature
then
the
rates
of
reaction
which
was
at
30
degree
will
be
doubled
and
40¬∞C.
Similarly ,
if
we
decrease
the
temperature
by
10
¬∞C,
then
the
rates
of
reaction
which
were
at
30
¬∞C
will
be
half
at
20¬∞C
right.
So,
these
gives
us
idea
why
the
application
of
high
temperature
is
detrimental
to
the
food
or
is
banned
for
the
food
whether
you
are
processing
or
whether
whatever
you
are
doing
in
terms
of
quality;
in
terms
of
quality
in
all
aspects
right.
In
all
aspects
of
quality ,
its
appearance,
its
color
its
flavor ,
its
nutritive
value
everything
together
are
this
is
the
bad.
Whereas,
if
you
we
lower
the
temperature
then
the
retention
of
color ,
retention
of
flavor ,
retention
of
nutritive
value,
everything
will
be
better
than
what
it
was
at
higher
temperature
right.
So,
Q
10
is
so
much
then
associated
with
all
the
processes
right.
So,
without
a
doubt
we
can
say
that
without
a
doubt
the
most
important
factor
affecting
post
harvest
life
is
the
temperature.
And
this
is
because
temperature
as
a
profound
effect
on
the
rates
of
the
biological
reactions
for
example,
metabolism
or
respiration.
The
other
day
perhaps
I
also
had
said
you
that
you
are
aspiring
every
now
and
then,
for
that
also
you
need
some
material
and
that
was
a
glucose.
Perhaps,
we
will
come
to
that,
but
let
us
go
quickly
otherwise
our
time
gets
away .

Slide
Time:

So,
this
is
over
the
physical
range
of
most
crops
that
is
0
to
30
¬∞C
increased.
So,
over
the
physical
range
of
most
crops
that
is
0
to
30
¬∞C
this
is
the
same
temperature
range
increased
temperature
causes
and
exponential
rise
in
respiration.
The
Vant
Hoff
rule
states
that
the
velocity
of
a
biological
reaction
increases
twice
or
thrice
or
2
times
or
3
times
right,
for
every
10
¬∞C
rise
in
temperature
typically
we
can
say
that
Q
10
for
the
growth
of
the
organisms
is
1.5,
Q
10
for
imbibitions
is
around
say
1.5
to
1.8
is
the
for
imbibition
is
what
1.5
to
1.8,
Q
10
for
photosynthesis
is
around
2.1
to
2.5
and
Q
10
for
respiration
is
around
2
to
3
right.
So,
the
thing
which
we
said
that
2
to
3
times
2
to
3
falls
then
is
coming
correct
this
is
a
general
this
is
the
general
figure
right,
in
absolute
in
particular
case
this
may
vary
this
may
differ,
but
this
gives
idea
that
what
could
be
if
imbibition
or
photosynthesis
or
growth
of
the
organisms
or
respiration
is
concerned
what
could
be
the
corresponding
temperature
quotient
values
right.
Let
us
then
look
into
this
photosynthesis.
So,
right
from
our
childhood
we
have
come
across
this
thing
photosynthesis
right,
where
this
trees
they
are
using
daylight
and
sunlight
and
using
carbon
dioxide
to
produce
their
to
produce
their
nutrient
right.
So,
from
this
water
plus
carbon
dioxide
it
comes
to
that
we
get
oxygen
and
C
6
H
12
O
6
that
is
glucose
right.
So,
this
is
a
general
equation
right
the
way
it
is
written
that
4
H
2
O
+
CO
2
C
6
H
12
O
6
+
O
2
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:04)
So,
easily
it
can
be
made
right,
but
in
actual
it
is
not
some
hints
we
have
given
here
you
see
this
under goes
a
cycle
typically
known
as
Calvin
Cycle
right.
and
just
to
show
you
that
how
difficult
or
how
they
are
complicated
the
cycles
are
and
this
is
called
bio
chemical
cycle.
The
other
day
I
also
told
you
that
for
bio
chemistry
you
go
to
a
book
called
Leninger
right,
that
is
book
on
biochemistry ,
if
you
see
that
then
you
can
come
across
that
what
different
types
of
biochemical
reactions
are
responsible
for
many
things
which
we
under go
right.
So,
whether
it
is
metabolism
or
any
other ,
so
that
will
be
very
much
required.
I
just
have
given
here
one
example
that
we
will
be
doing
here
this
Calvin
Cycle
how
difficult
it
is
you
see
here
though
our
schematic
diagram
showed
it
was
so
easy,
but
here
you
see
we
are
making
such
a
complicated
cycle
through
which
we
are
ultimately
we
are
getting
back
this
from
carbon
dioxide
and
water
to
this
your
oxygen
and
glucose
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:04)
So,
and
not
only
that
not
only
this
some
other
things
also
I
will
try
to
show
that
how
difficult
or
how
complicated
they
are
for
example,
this
was
Calvin
cycle,
this
is
respiration
cycle
and
here
you
see
this
is
respiration
cycle.
So,
we
are
taking
we
are
taking
carbohydrates
say
sugars
right,
coming
to
glucose
and
then
this
glucose
on
Glycolysis
they
are
making
some
energy
ATPs
etcetera,
coming
to
Pyruvic
acid,
then
acetyl
CoA
and
it
is
under going
to
KREBS
cycle
right.
So,
that
KREBS
cycle
how
difficult
how
complicated
this
is
I
would
like
to
show
you
here
also
and
this
is
if
we
are
taking
carbo
with
the
other
day
I
give
you
an
example
if
you6
remember
that
if
somebody
is
fed
with
only
fat
or
only
protein
or
only
carbohydrate
whether
you
will
survive
or
not
because
for
our
respiration
here
we
see
that
the
basic
is
glucose
from
glucose
we
are
getting
this
energy
and
we
are
respiring
right.
So
oxygen
is
required
oxygen
and
glucose
we
are
releasing
carbon
dioxide
water
and
we
are
getting
a
lot
of
energy
right.
So,
in
the
in
that
question
we
had
said
whether
people
will
be
surviving
if
somebody
is
only
paid
with
carbohydrate
or
with
fat
or
with
protein
here
we
see
that
we
started
with
this
carbohydrate
coming
to
the
KREBS
cycle,
we
started
with
fat
we
are
coming
to
that
KREBS
cycle
we
started
with
proteins
through
amino
acids
we
are
coming
back
to
KREBS
cycle,
everywhere
this
cycle
is
producing
carbon
dioxide
and
energy
and
we
are
also
taking
some
oxygen
right.
So,
there
are
glycolysis
of
course,
glycolysis
is
that
when
you
are
utilizing
glucose
for
conversion
of
that
glucose
into
rather
glucose
that
is
called
glycolysis,
that
does
not
depend
on
whether
it
is
aerobic
or
anaerobic;
glycolysis
can
happen
in
both
aerobic
and
anaerobic
because
that
creates
the
basic
that
is
the
glucose.
So,
once
you
have
that
then
you
it
under goes
the
cycle
it
under goes
that
formation
of
carbon
dioxide
and
energy
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
15:25)
So,
let
us
look
into
that
glucoses
so
here
small
energy
is
obtained
during
glycolysis
right.
And
then
through
Pyruvate
here
it
is
either
it
is
under going
anaerobic.
So
their
fermentation
lactic
7
acid
ethanol
is
being
produced
or
through
oxidative
where
through
KREBS
cycle
we
are
getting
ultimately
energy
carbon
dioxide
and
water
right
so
with
the
basic
is
glucoses.
So,
everywhere
as
in
the
previous
we
have
shown
that
if
it
is
fat
or
if
it
is
protein
then
all
are
getting
converted
into
glucose
and
then
that
you
will
be
being
utilized
for
the
respiration
cycle
right.
And
here
this
is
a
typical
KREBS
cycle
which
is
also
known
as
citric
acid
cycle
and
you
see
from
Pyruvate
it
is
CoA
acetyl
CoA
citrate
Succinate
for
then
Fumarate
or
malate
then
oxaloacetate.
So,
this
cycle
is
going
on
and
if
every
cases
either
releasing
or
giving
some
energy
or
taking
oxygen
right,
so
that
on
releasing
carbon
dioxide
and
water ,
so
depending
on
what
you
are
taking
your
respiration
cycle
is
offering
of
course
here
again
I
repeat
that
during
respiration
it
is
aerobic
respiration.
If
it
is
anaerobic
respiration
then
we
come
to
this
level
and
where
we
get
this
ethanol
or
may
be
lactic
acid
or
many
other
means
some
acids
or
ketones
or
aldehydes
are
being
produced,
for
example
when
you
run
for
a
long
time
when
you
are
running
for
a
long
time
then
you
many
cases
you
have
observed
that
you
are
getting
some
pain
either
typical
pain
on
the
legs
and
others
right.
And
that
is
primarily
because
your
body
was
requiring
lot
of
oxygen
which
is
not
getting
you
are
not
supplying
that
oxygen
or
oxygen
is
not
available.
So,
that
is
why
it
underwear
to
anaerobic
path
and
that
produce
this
acids
or
ketones
or
aldehydes
which
are
not
desirable,
but
if
it
is
going
through
the
oxidative
path
then
it
will
produce
carbon
dioxide
water
and
lot
of
energy.
My
intention
is
that
how
complicated
things
are
how
complicated
cycles
are
in
that
to
give
you
some
idea
I
just
highlighted
these
two
cycles
and
this
two
are
some
I
can
say
as
example
for
bringing
your
inquisitiveness
into
this
biochemical
also
right.
8(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:42)
Biochemical
is
all
together
different
than
chemicals
and
it
is
much
more
complicated
keep
in
mind
ok.
Now ,
let
us
go
in
to
some
these
of
course
we
have
said
chill
storage
and
other
I
am
not
much
in
favor
of
this
that
again
this
is
some
definitions
0
to

¬∞C
is
called
chill
storage,
and
where
psychrotrophs
can
grow
this
psychrotrophs
can
grow
relatively
slowly
for
example,
generation
time
for
pseudomonas
available
in
fish
is
around
68
hours
around
5
¬∞C
compared
to
26
hours
at
0
¬∞C.
So,
that
chill
storage
is
good
for
that
we
are
getting
we
are
showering
down
the
microbial
activities
as
example
we
have
given
pseudomonas
that
is
available
in
fresh
fish
is
growing
up
since
6
to
8
hour
at
5
¬∞C
whereas,
at
0
¬∞C
it
takes
around
more
than
one
day
26
to
27
hours
right.
So
the
lower
the
temperature
then
better
the
product
is
that
Q
10
is
coming
directly
here
right.
So,
as
the
temperature
is
lowered
the
plasma
membrane
of
the
organism
under goes
phase
transition
from
liquid
crystalline
to
the
jail,
in
which
transportation
of
solutes
is
extremely
difficult
that
is
why
they
are
not
surviving
and
mesophiles.
I
hope
psychrophyll
mesophile
this
we
understand
thermophile
a
thermophile
is
at
high
temperature
organisms,
mesophyll
is
medium
temperature
organisms,
and
psychrophyll
s
are
low
temperature
organisms
for
their
production
activity
all
right.
9
So,
they
love
they
those
who
love
at
high
temperature
are
called
thermophile
lows
who
are
loving
at
low
temperature
called
psychrophilic.
So,
mesophiles
can
grow
at
chilling
temperature,
but
not
necessarily
get
killed
right
this
cant
mesophiles
cant
grow
at
chilling
temperature,
but
not
necessarily
be
killed
right.
So,
it
should
be
cant
certain
psychrotropes
such
as
pseudomonas
do
grow
and
cause
also
food
poisoning
at
relatively
low
temperature.
So,
I
said
in
the
beginning
that
this
is
generally
not
in
particular .
So,
that
pseudomonas
is
typical
example
which
can
cause
some
bad
and
food
poisoning
may
occur
right,
this
I
am
giving
as
example
right
example
in
the
sense
that
this
is
the
typical
away
from
the
normal
right.
Then
we
come
to
another
that
is
called
moisture
loss
right
you
remember
in
the
previous
class
we
said
that
there
are
many
ways
of
preserving
food
material
that
moisture
loss
is
oen
such
that
is
drying.
So,
by
that
is
the
major
problem
is
moisture.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
23:25)
Moisture
is
the
primary
problem
of
the
food
material
to
keep
for
longer
time
or
preserve
it
for
long
time
because
that
produce
several
types
of
pro
packaging
are
also
nowadays
come
up
and
that
helps
in
maintaining
that
moisture.
So,
moisture
is
a
primary
enemy
for
the
food
because
the
highest
the
moisture
level
more
it
is
vulnerable
for
changes
right.
10
So,
the
lower
the
moisture
level
better
is
the
quality
better
is
the
retention
better
is
the
life
of
the
food
material.
I
give
two
examples
one
with
high
a
high
moisture
content
food
material
right
say
a
fish
meat
they
are
all
perishable
right,
but
low
moisture
that
is
powdered
baby
powder
or
milk
powder .
So,
they
are
at
very
low
temperature
low
moisture
content.
So,
low
moisture
material
do
survive
for
a
longer
period
right
or
do.
So,
in
that
case
large
pieces
of
meat
are
often
impact
in
plastic
bags
or
spread
with
various
moisture
resistant
and
coatings
and
eggs
are
coated
with
edible
oil
which
sells
the
minute
pores
of
the
egg
shells
beefs
aging
at
95
%,
RH
for
several
weeks
at
2
¬∞C
with
ultraviolet
rays.
So,
these
are
a
typical
some
example
of
high
moisture
or
the
moisture
problem
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:51)
So,
in
that
another
thing
which
comes
in
is
the
freezing
right,
in
the
low
temperature
that
is
the
freezing
if
we
lower
the
temperature
and
freeze
it
then
we
have
just
said
that
the
rates
of
reaction
comes
down
drastically
depending
on
how
far
you
are
going
right
that
example
also
we
will
be
giving
how
far
you
are
going
in
terms
of
temperature
this
is
not
only
processing,
but
also
the
storage
right.
So,
when
you
are
making
it
then
this
will
be
the
method
will
be
beyond
the
purview
of
this
class,
because
that
is
another
technique
either
drying
or
freezing
these
are
different
techniques
they
different
engineering
processes
which
is
beyond
the
purview
of
this
class,
but
11
to
have
some
idea
we
will
say
that
freezing
you
can
differentiate
that
if
keep
you
keep
one
small
bucket
of
a
water
in
your
house
hold
refrigerator
you
will
see
that
it
will
take
maybe
several
hours
to
freeze
depending
on
the
size
and
the
container .
If
you
keep
in
plastic
container
then
it
will
take
much
longer
time
then
if
you
keep
it
in
some
metallic
container
right.
So
depending
on
that
it
may
be
vary
but
time
requirement
is
very
high
whereas,
if
you
have
same
say
carol
liquid
like
liquid
nitrogen
you
can
freeze
it
instantly
almost
in
no
time
may
be
in
terms
of
seconds
or
in
terms
of
minutes
right.
And
in
both
the
process
your
size
of
the
ice
crystals
number
of
the
ice
crystals
there
been
produced
there
also
are
quite
different
in
some
case
in
the
farmer
case
that
is
when
you
are
keeping
in
the
house
hold
refrigerator
the
size
of
the
ice
crystal
is
very
high
number
is
very
low.
So,
the
cell
damage
and
other
losses
are
very
high
whereas,
if
you
would
have
done
that
thing
the
same
thing
in
nitrogen
then
that
would
have
been
much
much
better ,
and
you
could
have
done
a
lot
in
that
in
the
sense
then
size
of
the
crystals
are
very
very
small,
number
of
ice
crystals
are
very
very
high.
So,
to
make
that
comparison
I
have
given
that
when
you
are
storing
cauliflower
at
around
-18
¬∞C,
or
-12
or
-7¬∞C
you
see
the
storage
time
12
month
for
cauliflower
27
month
for
chicken.
That
means,
depending
on
what
product
you
are
taking
time
temperature
period
all
are
getting
different
at
-12
it
is
2.5
months
and
10
or
8
moths
-7
¬∞C
right.
So
if
you
look
at
this
is
a
typical
different
time
temperature
combination
for
storage
right,
I
just
give
an
example
I
am
not
discussing
this
then
before
this
I
think
there
was
one
no
ok.
12(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:19)
So
that
means,
when
we
are
talking
about
that
the
temperature
is
one
of
the
primary
consideration
where
you
are
freezing
before
or
that
is
below
freezing
or
above
freezing
that
is
a
primary
concern
as
well
at
what
temperature
you
are
keeping
right.
So,
this
will
dictate
you
how
long
you
can
keep
your
material
under
good
condition
right.
So,
we
stop
it
here
Thank
you.
