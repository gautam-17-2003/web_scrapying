Emerging
Technology
(Contd.)
So,
Emer ging
Technology
in
continuation,
in
the
last
class
we
could
not
finish
because
obviously ,
as
and
when
the
new
and
new
things
are
coming
up
we
are
also
getting
stuck
into
that
to
explain
more
and
more
right.
Now
in
continuation
of
the
previous
class,
let
us
look
into
that
this
is
under
dairy
and
food
process
and
the
products
technology
and
this
is
the
11th
lecture
right
and
we
are
talking
about
the
emer ging
technology
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:00)
So,
if
you
look
into
this
then
we
see
that
the
previous
one
was
like
this
that
high
voltage
electric
pulse
right.
1
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:16)
If
we
remember
that,
we
talked
about
in
the
previous
class
ultrasonication,
then
heat
and
pressure;
all
this
three
together
in
combination
we
had
said
as
one
of
the
technology
emer ging
technologies
which
is
coming
up
right.
Then
we
say
that
high
voltage
electric
pulse
which
we
said
in
the
previous
class.
Now
let
us
also
explain
a
little
so
that
we
understand
what
the
process
is
high
voltage
electric
shocks
right
and
that
is
called
Electroporation
is
given
to
in
activate
the
vegetative
bacterial
cells
vegetative.
Now
the
previous
class
you
also
said
one
more
thing,
that
was
the
spore
former
right.
So,
those
vegetative
cells
which
become
more
resistant,
then
they
form
spore
former .
It
is
not
that
all
organisms
can
do
the
spores;
there
are
very
selective
organisms,
which
can
do
which
can
form
the
spores
and
they
become
the
resistant
to
right.
So,
in
this
method
of
electric
pulse
giving
the
high
voltage
shock
and
that
spoils
the
vegetative
bacteria
or
vegetative
cells
as
well
as
yeast
and
mold.
Vegetative
means
which
and
grow
under
given
favorable
condition
rapidly
right;
normal
growth.
So,
in
that
case
they
are
called
vegetative
cells
right
while
bacterial
spores
are
much
more
tolerant.
So,
for
spore
former
which
you
have
seen
in
the
previous
one
there
they
even
the
spore
formers
who
are
were
affected,
but
in
this
the
spore
formers
are
not.
So,
because
they
are
tolerant
to
the
high
the
voltage
shock
or
high
voltage
pulse
given
right,
then
what
it
does?
A
high
voltage
breaches
the
structure.
So,
breaches
means
if
some
we
understand
by
the
term
breach
English
term,
that
is
that
you
are
dividing
or
you
are
breaking
2
something;
so,
right.
So,
it
is
breaking
the
structure
of
the
cell
membrane,
which
is
controlling
many
of
the
vegetative
cells
homeostatic
mechanism;
homeostatic
means
the
condition
was
where
it
can
grow
easily .
So,
that
homeostatic
condition
is
being
broken
and
the,
and
maintenance
of
the
cytoplasm,
that
is
also
cytoplasmic
pH
that
is
also
getting
hampered.
So,
these
pH
gradient
across
the
membrane
and
the
osmotic
balance
of
the
cell
all
these
are
being
hampered
by
the
electrostatics
electro
so,
that
by
the
electric
pulse
which
is
applied.
So,
the
breach
that
is
the
structural
break
of
this
cell
mem
membrane
that
occurs
and
because
of
that
the
vegetative
cells
are
not
able
to
grow
right
because
that
is
also
effecting
the
homeostatic
mechanism
of
this
cell
as
well
the
cytoplasmic
pH
and
pH
gradient
across
the
membrane
and
osmotic
balance
all
these
are
getting
affected
right.
The
major
disadvantage
is
in
this
process
is
that
the
treatment
time
requirement
or
number
of
pulse
requirement
is
very
high
right
so,
that
is
the
primary .
That
treatment
time
as
well
as
the
number
of
pulses
you
remember
we
are
shown
earlier
that
pulses
means
we
said
like
this.
So,
this
is
an
electric
wave
pulse.
If
that
is,
this
cycles
of
pulses
if
they
are
very
high
right
then
that
becomes
one
disadvantage
right
as
well
as
the
time
because
the
more
the
pulses
number
required
more
will
be
the
time
required.
So,
that
is
the
basic
disadvantage
and
syner gism
with
other
preservative
factors
may
improve
efficacy .
So;
that
means,
simultaneously
if
we
can
apply
some
chemicals
along
with
this,
then
we
can
get
syner gistic
effect
along
with
this
high
shock
or
high
voltage
right.
For
example,
which
at
nisin
and
other
bacteriocins,
that
is
potential
that
potentiates
the
lethal
effects
of
the,
you
have
the
electroporation
right.
So,
this
potential
can
be
improved,
if
we
take
the
help
of
simultaneously
some
other
along
with
this.
So,
again
it
is
a
combination.
So,
high
intensity
high
light
pulses
which
were
also
we
said.
3(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:00)
So,
in
that
high
intensity
laser
and
non
cohesive
and
non
coherent
light
pulses
are
used
in
to
deactivate
or
as
this
can
act
as
a
microcidal
effect;
that
means,
it
is
killing
the
microor ganism
right.
Of
often
new
practical
approaches
to
the
decontamination
approaches
to
the
food
and
packaging
material
services
this
offers
new
a
practical
approach
this
high
intensity
pulse,
to
do
decontaminate
the
surface
of
the
of
the
food.
So,
these
killing
effect
not
self
sufficient,
but
killing
effects
may
sometimes
result
from
the
partial
heating,
because
of
the
light
which
is
being
given.
So,
that
may
increase
the
law
time
increase
the
temperature
because
that
may
have
some
partial
killing
effect.
So,
process
like
physical
removal
of
microor ganism
from
surface
that
is
ablation
and
ultraviolet
irradiation
are
required
to
form
the
basis
of
the
technique
and
this
request
detail
result.
So,
it
is
still
under
infant
or
not
an
infant
under
researcher
program,
but
this
also
as
one
thing
that
in
many
of
the
cases
where
handling
of
the
food
products
become
difficult
right.
So,
during
handling
they
may
incorporate
some
contamination
and
this
in
contamination
on
the
surface
that
can
be
easily
minimized
by
this
high
light
pulses
right;
high
intensity
light
pulses.
So,
that
is
a
very
good
thing,
which
can
come
up
right.
Then
high
intensity
magnetic
fields.
So,
if
you
also
incorporate
high
intensity
magnetic
fields
like
oscillating
magnetic
fields
right.
So,
where
this
oscillation
in
activate
microor ganisms
on
the
packaging
material.
So,
you
have
already
taken
a
pack
the
material.
4
Now ,
you
want
to
minimize
the
or
remove
the
organisms
or
kill
the
organism.
So,
this
high
intensity
magnetic
field
or
oscillating
magnetic
field
can
come
up
as
one
of
the
risk
square
of
your
system
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
10:13)
Then
the
mechanism
is
believed
to
be
that
that
magnetic
energy
couples
into
dipolar
molecules
and
may
change
membrane
fluidity
and
interfere
with
the
fluxes
across
the
cell
membrane
right.
Bacterial
spores
are
not
affected
in
all
the
cases,
whatever
we
have
discussed
till
now
you
see,
the
spore
formers
because
spore
are
very
what
should
I
say
it
is
very
resistant
tolerant
resistant
tolerant
to
normal
conditions
by
which
the
vegetative
cells
are
destroyed
easily .
So,
here
also
that
mechanism
is
more
fruitful
for
the
vegetative
cells,
but
may
not
be
so
for
the
spore
formers.
And
these
efficacies
of
the
treatment
have
not
exceeded
about
100
fold
reductions
in
the
number
of
vegetative
bacteria
right.
Subsequently
you
will
see
that
in
the
death
cycle
right
there
are
there
are
many
such
thing
which
you
come
up
death
cycle
where
it
is
termed
in
terms
of
how
many
number
of
lock
cycles
it
is
being
reduced
whether
it
is
12D,
6D,
10D,
8D
that
dictates
that
what
is
the
number
of
cycles
reduction,
that
is
originally
the
number
of
organisms
present
could
be
10
to
the
power
12.
Now
after
your
reduction
if
you
do
12
d
then
it
should
come
to
1
right.
So,
in
that
case
it
is
like
that.
So,
that
this
microbial
that
that
limited
applications
are
because
of
that,
it
is
spore
formation
not
in
activated
and
not
more
than
100
fold
that
is
100
times,
that
is
10
to
the
5
power
2
it
is
not
getting
destroyed.
So,
examples
are
streptococcus
thermophilus
inoculated
into
milk,
saccharomyces
cervisiae
in
orange
juices
or
mold
spores
in
bread
if
they
are
looked
into
under
this
kind
of
thing.Then
it
is
in
not
more
than
10
to
the
power
2
or
100
spores
the
reductions
are
being
managed
to
obtain.
Then
we
come
to
the
microbiological
safety ,
if
aim
is
to
inactivate
microor ganisms
in
foods;
if
that
is
the
aim
to
inactivate
the
microor ganisms
in
food,
then
there
must
be
some
basis
for
judging
it
right
and
the
efficacy
required
to
delivery
is
sufficiently
microbiologically
safe
product.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:25)
So,
that
you
can
depend
that
yes
this
process
has
efficacy
and
has
been
proved
its
efficacy
and
its
can
be
applicable
microor ganisms
in
terms
of
microor ganism
or
microbiologically
it
is
safe
right.
So,
how
normally
thermal
processing
is
traditionally
based
on
the
particular
inactivation
kinetics
and
they
are
typically
it
is
said,
just
before
I
was
referring
to
that
for
the
sterilization
of
the
high
water
activity
and
low
as
it
foods,
it
is
said
that
12D
concept
the
targeting
spores
of
proteolytic
strains,
of
clostridium
botulinum.
Clostridium
botulinum
is
one
organism
which
is
considered
to
be
highly
spore
forming
and
very
heat
resistant.
So,
if
that
is
it
destroyed,
then
it
can
be
said
that
yes
the
food
material
is
away
from
the,
or
it
safe
for
the
microbial
point
of
view .
Similarly ,
pasteurization
in
that,
it
could
be
6D
or
8D
concept
that
may
be
applied.
Now
this
D
concept
perhaps
this
is
also
not
within
our
this
course
curricular .
So,
we
may
not
be
able
to
6
go
into
detail
because
that
is
the
death
kinetics
of
the
organisms.
So,
if
everything
has
to
be
told
in
the
class,
then
till
the
course
will
not
be
covered.
So,
I
advice
you
that
you
please
also
look
into
the
death
kinetics
of
the
food
material
of
the
micro
organisms
right
where
this
D
value,
z
value,
d
is
f
value
these
will
come
up
and
you
can
easily
pickup
what
is
being
said
that
what
is
12D
or
6D
right.
So,
these
conclude
that
that
suitable
that
are
often
this
the
process
6D
or
8D
processes
are
often
concluded
to
be
suitable
targets
for
the
destruction
one
of
the
pathogenic
organisms
because
pathogens
are
not
that
much
heat
resistant
or
that
much
resistant.
So,
in
that
case
when
pathogens
are
getting
destroyed,
then
we
can
say
that
the
product
is
microbiology
or
pathogenically
it
is
safe
to
consume
right.
So,
that
6
D,
8
D,
12
D
this
concepts
are
comings.
So,
you
please
also
consult
that
death
microbiology
of
the
material.
I
hope
we
have
finished
little
early
in
this,
but,
but
here
then
we
can
say
that
new
technology ,
which
or
emer ging
there
are
many
more
emer ging
technologies
are
there.
So,
it
is
not
that
all
the
time
we
can
utilize
them
or
all
the
time
we
can
bring
them
into
as
we
said
one
two
cases,
we
have
said
that
it
is
still
under
the
lab
scale,
lot
of
some
more
researches
are
required
and
also
the
destruction
of
or
elimination
of
the
organisms
are
not
to
the
extent
as
it
is
required.
So,
in
that
case
more
and
more
thorough
investigation
has
to
be
done
and
then
only
we
can
say
yes
that
is
done
right,
but
since
we
have
some
more
time
then
let
us
also
look
into
that
what
are
the
difficulties
in
introducing
the
new
or
this
technology ,
which
we
are
coming
in
which
we
are
calling
to
be
emer ging
right.
This
is
emer ging
means
they
are
coming
right
they
are
coming,
but
they
have
not
come
up.
So,
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
not
only
the
microbial
contamination,
yes
microbiology
or
microbial
contamination
is
one
major
because
either
it
spoils
the
food
material
or
it
is
it
is
making
the
consumer
affected
with
the
maybe
pathogen
or
some
other
organisms.
So,
if
that
is
removed
yes,
a
little
we
are
assured
of
the
safety
of
consuming
the
food.
But
the
primary
concern
is
the
efficacy
of
the
new
technology ,
which
you
are
bringing
in.
So,
new
technology
when
you
are
bringing
in,
that
time
definitely
you
should
not
be
only
considering
the
microbiological
status.
But
also
others
like
the
other
day
we
are
said
the
quality ,
that
overall
quality
aspect
right
both
in
terms
if
it
mean
if
it
happens
that
to
do
that
microbiologically
yes
like
high
pressure
right.
7So,
when
you
are
giving
high
pressure
technology ,
that
time
you
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
not
only
the
organisms,
which
you
are
considering,
but
also
the
appearance,
the
color
the
shape,
the
size,
the
texture,
then
this
if
it
is
viscous
material
the
viscosity
or
if
it
is
not
then
viscosity
should
not
be
increased
all
these
aspects.
If
the
viscosity
become
increased
again
that
the
word
we
will
used
pumpable
or
not
right.
If
it
is
low
viscous
then
pump
required
that
the
cost
on
pump
or
the
energy
on
pump
requirement
will
be
less.
So,
its
more
acceptable,
but
if
the
process
changes
the
viscosity .
So,
that
it
becomes
highly
viscous
from
whatever
it
was
then
definitely
the
manufacturer
will
be
implementing
this
new
technology
will
think
no
may
not
be
that
this
technology
at
the
moment
can
be
implemented
right.
So,
to
consider
a
new
technology
lot
many
other
aspects,
other
than
microbiology
is
required
to
be
kept
in
mind
right.
And
in
that
case
we
should
be
very
much
we
should
be,
it
is
you
should
be
very
much
judging
the
process
judging
the
technology
in
terms
of
its
efficacy
right.
So,
efficacy
of
course,
in
terms
of
organisms,
but
also
in
all
other
quality
aspects
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
and
also
the
process
cost,
which
is
very
fundamental
because
high
pressure
technology
to
create
that
high
pressure
you
have
to
have
system
and
this
is
normally
hydrostatic
pressure
and
in
that
case
high
pressure
development
will
be
a
major
obstacle
for
the
implementation
right.
So,
if
your
instrumental
cost
is
very
high
to
bring
that
instrument
maybe
several
lakhs
or
crores
rupees
you
have
to
incur ,
then
the,
that
cost
will
come
on
to
the
product.
So,
the
product
which
was
otherwise
we
conventional
mechanism,
which
was
available
maybe
say
for
comparison
10
rupees
piece
or
a
pouch
it
was
available.
If
that
pouch
now
under
high
pressure
if
it
is
to
be
costing
around
50,
60,
100
rupees;
obviously ,
the
consumer
that
they
will
take
it
otherwise
and
they
would
keep
their
mind
and
face
from
the
new
best
technology
right.
So,
when
we
are
approaching
when
we
are
adhering
to
the
new
and
newly
developed
technologies,
then
we
should
also
consider
the
cost
primarily .
Because
technologically
it
may
be
very
good,
but
the
cost
wise
if
that
is
not
comparative,
if
that
is
not
at
per
with
the
already
available,
then
the
purpose
is
defeated
right.
This
we
should
keep
in
mind
and
we
should
also
look
into
the
quality
aspects.
All
put
together
it
is
not
when
you
are
judging
technique
or
technology ,
that
times
it
is
not
a
single
8parameter
on
which
we
will
decide.
Technologically
it
is
it
may
be
proved
that
yes
the
purpose
may
be
served
right
for
which
the
technology
has
come
up
yes
it
is
serving
the
purpose,
but
it
is
again
with
respect
to
both
microbial
or
non
microbial
status,
but
again
the
price
also.
Then
again
it
becomes
that
if
the
price
is
also
comparable,
but
the
implementation
that
may
need
lot
of
perennial
others
like
it
may
be
it
may
not
be
friendly
to
the
ecology
or
a
environment.
So,
in
that
case
keeping
everything
then
the
developed
technology
because
of
the
non
environmental
friendly
may
not
be
acceptable
and
may
not
get
the
light.
So,
that
people
will
accept
or
implement
it.
So,
when
new
technologies
we
are
concerning,
we
are
definitely
considering
the
effect,
we
are
definitely
considering
the
effect
on
micro
organism,
we
are
also
considering
the
quality
aspect
of
the
material
as
well
that
if
there
any
nutritional
if
there
any
nutritional
disorder
nutritional
destruction
of
the
process
make
by
which
you
are
killing
organism
by
which
you
are
doing.
So,
nutritional
quality
that
went
down
then;
obviously ,
you
will
not
be
able
to
sustained
with
the
new
technology .
So,
nutritional
balance,
nutritional
quality
should
also
not
get
hampered
with
the
technology ,
you
are
bringing
into.
I
am
not
against
high
pressure
it
is
not
the
that
I
am
not
saying
that
high
pressure
technology
is
bad
or
the
other
one
high
electrostatic
field
or
high
magnetic
field
whatever
we
have
discussed
or
combination
we
have
also
seen
that
technologically
combination
system
may
be
applied
right.
Combinations
scheme
may
be
thought
of
in
such
a
way
that
all
put
together
syner gism
may
occur .
But
again
that
this
is
not
one
aspect,
but
other
aspects
of
the
contribution
towards
the
maintenance
of
the
nutritional
value,
towards
the
cost
incurred
or
it
also
can
be
that
the
initial
cost.
The
initial
cost
may
be
very
high,
but
operating
cost
is
very
low
right
for
example,
that
air
conditioning
right.
If
the
air
conditioning
is
made
with
the
conventional
air
refrigeration
system,
then
the
operating
cost
becomes
very
small.
So,
there
the
initial
cost
could
be
high,
but
since
the
operating
cost
is
very
high
very
low,
then
people
will
go
for
it.
But
if
someone
is
bringing
something
where
the
operated
initial
cost
is
very
low,
but
operating
cost
is
very
high,
then
that
becomes
headache
to
the
implementer .
9So,
we
he
or
they
we
will
think
that
why
should
this
operating
curve
because
operating
cost
initial
cost
you
may
get
people
or
who
are
the
entrepreneur ,
they
are
they
may
gets
bank
support
or
support
from
other
agencies.
But
the
same
may
not
be
true
with
when
the
operating
cost
is
high,
because
operating
cost
has
to
come
from
the
manufacturer
or
processor .
So,
they
will
think
twice
right.
So,
I
am
not
saying
one
factor ,
this
is
that
only
that
initial
investment
or
operating
cost
while
you
are
considering
you
have
to
consider
all
in
totality ,
such
that
you
can
say
yes
our
system
is
full
proved
and
proof
from
all
the
sides.
So,
emer ging
technology
is
which
will
come
up,
they
have
to
compete
from
all
corners
with
the
all
this
already
existing
systems
ok.
So,
let
us
stop
it
today
here
time
is
over.
So
be
again
that,
please
look
into
the
thermal
death
kinetics
of
the
microwave
microbes
from
some
other
sources
ok.
Thank
you.
