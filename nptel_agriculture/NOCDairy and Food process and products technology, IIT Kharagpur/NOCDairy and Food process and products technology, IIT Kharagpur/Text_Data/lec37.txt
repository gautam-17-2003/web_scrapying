Spoilage
of
Milk
and
Milk
Products
Hello.
After
completing
as
far
as
possible
the
constituents
of
milk
in
details
along
with
along
with;
so
many
associated
things
we
have
tried
to
cover
so
that
it
helps
you
in
understanding
not
only
in
milk,
but
also
in
other
food
whether
it
is
processed
or
as
a
whole.
Now
we
move
to
that
spoilage;
spoilage
of
milk
that
was
our
one
of
the
mandate;
given
mandate
means,
outline
which
we
had
given.
And
the
spoilage
normally
we
come
across
is
primarily
by
microor ganisms.
The
other
one
we
normally
don’ t
talk
about
spoilage
because
that
is
not
the
chemical
one
unless
you
are
adding
some
chemical
which
is
not
desirable
which
may
be
toxic
and
others.
So,
unless
that
is
done
normally
they
are
not
spoiled
by
the
chemicals
as
such.
So,
it
is
mainly
the
microbial
spoilage
which
are
concerned;
however ,
we
will
try
because
chemical
associated
things
like
we
said
if
you
remember
that
when
you
are
heating
milk
for
whatever
be
the
reason.
When
you
are
heating
milk
then
there
may
be
browning
and
that
browning
is
primarily
because
of
either
caramelization
or
Maillard
reaction.
So,
here
also
if
that
comes
in
we
will
try
to
because
I
have
said
we
will
try
to
encompass
as
much
as
possible.
Because
this
is
not
true
that
Maillard
reactions
or
caramelization
happens
only
in
milk,
it
is
also
associated
with
all
other
foods
wherever
the
things
are
happening
or
wherever
you
are
heating,
wherever
there
is
the
reason
for
caramelization
reason
for
Maillard
reaction.
So,
we
will
come
across
with
them
also
right;
of
course,
now
we
have
to
also
progress
a
little
faster
because
our
leftover
number
of
lectures
are
also
not
so,
high
and
our
leftover
as
we
have
given
the
more
or
less
some
outlines;
those
are
also
to
be
taken
care
of
right.
So,
we
will
try ,
but
again
I
will
not
compromise
with
the
subject,
with
the
depth
of
knowledge
or
understanding
that
I
am
not
going
to
compromise
right.
So,
as
far
as
practicable
I
will
try
to
analyze
I
will
try
to
explain
and
ok
we
will
go
along
with
the
time
and
then
someday
definitely
the
course
will
be
over .
So,
before
that
at
least
I
wish
allof
you
gain
suf ficient
knowledge,
understanding
is
also
there;
see
if
that
can
be
that
is
my
objective
and
motto;
that
you
must
be
benefited.
So,
that
benefit
toward
extent
both
it
depends
on
the
giver
and
the
taker
isn’ t
it?
So,
let
us
come
to
today’ s
one
that
is
lecture
number
37,
this
is
lecture
number
37
and
this
encompasses
chemical
and
microbial
spoilage
of
the
milk
and
milk
products
that
was
the
outline
right.
So,
in
that
we
will
first
talk
about
microbial
spoilage
right.
So
again
a
little
background
of
the
microbiology
though
this
is
not
coming
under
the
purview
of
the
course
explicitly ,
but
since
implicitly
it
is
also
associated;
so
I
hope
some
knowledge,
some
idea
because
there
may
be
some
students
who
had
no
microbiological
background.
So,
for
them
this
will
be
a
grick;
I
don’ t
want
that
right.
So,
now ,
we
come
to
these
factors
influencing
the
growth
of
the
microor ganisms
in
any
food.
W e
eat
milk,
we
eat
any
food;
so
what
are
the
factors
those
are
responsible
for
the
growth
of
the
microor ganism.
If
you
remember
in
some
class
we
had
said
that
the
growth
curve
of
microbes
are
like
this
right;
so,
it
is
lag
phase
and
growth
phase
and
decay
like
that
this
is
there
right.
So,
this
lag
phase,
stationary
phase,
lag
phase,
growth
phase;
so,
those
are
there
I
am
not
going
to
explain
on
that
because
that
is
not
the
subject
of
this.
But
what
are
the
factors
which
will
influence
the
growth
of
the
microor ganisms?
Definitely
you
must
know
because
that
should
be
applicable
to
dairy
as
well
as
any
food
product
right.
So,
we
must
look
into
the
factors
which
are
responsible
for
the
growth
of
the
microor ganisms.
For
example,
I;
I
give
you
that
you
keep
some
milk
just
like
that
outside
and
maybe,
may
not
be
for
couple
of
hours,
maybe
for
depending
on
what
is
what
is
the
outside
condition.
So,
in
that
condition
maybe
after
several
hours;
I
should
use
that
several
hours
because
we
don’ t
know
what
is
the
outside
ambience.
So,
whatever
it
be;
so
that
is
why
after
several
hours
you
will
come
and
see
that
milk
is
no
longer
remaining
as
milk,
something
has
happened
to
that.
So,
there
it
means
microbes
which
we
cannot
see
that
is
why
it
is
microbe
and
micro
means
10
to
the
power
minus
6;
any
microbe
is
10
to
the
power
minus
6
order .
So,
if
that
be
which
we
cannot
see
in
naked
eye;
so
whether
it
was
originally
in
milk
or
it
is
invading
from
outside
that
is
not
known
to
us,
but
whatever
it
be,
whatever
be
the
source
of
the
or ganism;
it
got
suf ficient
food
in
milk
that
is
why
it
could
grow
or
multiply
and
then
those
microbes
multiplied
microbes,
they
did
action
on
the
milk
and
milk
became
not
acceptable
right.
So,
we
should
talk
about
the;
what
are
the
factors
those
are
responsible
for
the
growth
of
the
microor ganisms
right?
So,
there
in
production
and
preservation
factors
that
influence
microbial
growth
in
production
and
preservation
both,
that
conditions
naturally
present
in
food
termed
as
the
intrinsic
factors.
So,
those
which
are
in
the
food
itself
the
conditions;
they
are
called
intrinsic
factors
and
environmental
conditions
are
termed
as
extrinsic
factors
right.
So,
those
conditions
which
are
already
prevailing
in
the
food
material;
they
are
called
intrinsic
factors
and
those
which
are
outside
the
food
material,
they
are
called
extrinsic
factor .
So,
these
2
factors
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
are
governing
the
growth
of
the
or ganism;
microor ganisms
right.
And
factors
combined
to
determine
which
microbes
grow
in
particular
food
and
at
what
rate?
So,
there
could
be
some;
where
the
combination
of
these
2
that
is
intrinsic
and
extrinsic
may
also
decide
that
which
microor ganisms
will
grow
under
what
conditions
right?
Which
microor ganisms
will
go
grow
particularly
in
which
food
that
will
depend
on
the
food
and
the
environment
both
together
right.
So,
these
we
will
discuss
today
maybe
if
the
time
does
not
permit.
W e
will
carry
forward
to
the
next
class
or
subsequent
classes
as
and
when
it
is
required
right.Now ,
if
we
look
at
intrinsic
factors
what
are
there?
So,
the
intrinsic
factors
which
are
there
are
multiplication
of
microbes
is
generally
influenced
by
inherent
character
of
the
food.
So,
what
is
the
character
of
the
food?
Because
that
is
one
primary
reason
right;
character
means
say
some
are
acidic
food,
some
are
high
sugar
food
or
sweet.
So,
depending
on
what
type
of
factors
some
are
less
acidic
food.
So,
depending
on
this
definitely
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms
will
be
influenced
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
microbes
multiply
most
rapidly
in
moist;
nutritionally
rich
pH
neutral
foods
right.
So,
they
multiply
mostly
where
it
is
moist;
so
moisturize
is
a
primary
factor .
Again
I
have
referred
to
many
times
that
water
activity;
this
water
activity
term
is
always
associated
because
that
is
the
availability
of
the
water
for
the
or ganism
to
grow .
Now ,
this
we
are
not
saying
which
or ganisms;
it
could
be
bacteria,
it
could
be
yeast,
it
could
be
mold.
Because
in
the
earlier
class
we
said
we
are
concerned
food
engineers,
food
scientist,
food
technologist;
we
are
concerned
mostly
with
these
3
or ganisms,
these
3
types
of
microbes
that
bacteria,
yeast
and
mold
right.
And
earlier
in
earlier
classes
we
are
also
showed
that
bacteria
needs
high
moisture
water
activity
level
is
high
is
needs
relatively
less,
water
activity
is
relatively
lower
than
that.
And
the
mold
needs
even
lower
that
this
water
activity
is
even
lower ,
but
in
all
the
cases
moisture
is
a
must;
that
is
why
in
dehydrated
or
dried
food,
the
microbes
are
not
growing
or
not
spoiling
the
food
right.
So,
where
the
water
availability
is
not
there
in
dehydrated
food
which
is
less
than
the
water
activity
level
required
for
the
or ganisms
to
grow
right.
So,
it
is
microbes
are
multiply
rapidly
in
moist,
nutritionally
rich,
pH
neutral
foods
right.
So,
in
that
if
we
look
at
the
intrinsic
factors
what
are
they?
One
is
water
availability ,
second
is
pH,
third
is
nutrient
availability ,
fourth
is
biological
barriers,
fifth
is
antimicrobial
chemicals
if
there
is
present.
So,
these
are
the
intrinsic
parameters
which
influence
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms
right;
now
let
us
look
in
to
what
it
says.
So,
water
availability;
so,
water
availability
we
can
say
that
foods
normally
do
have
very
foods
vary
dramatically
in
terms
of
water
availability .
Some
food
do
have
90,
95,
98
percents,
some
foods
may
have
around
50,
60
percent
depending
on
the
food
right?
Those
nuts
they
are
having
very
low
moisture
that
is
why
you
see
that
nuts;
we
go
to
the
shop
you
just
ask
and
you
don’ t
know
when
it
was
supplied.
Though
nowadays
as
we
said
in
our
earlier
class
in
laws
and
regulations
that
is
mandatory
that
if
it
is
packed
one,
then
the
date
of
manufacture
and
expiry
has
to
be,
but
still
there
are
many
many
local
small
scale
industries;
they
do
supply
in
packs
and
where
there
is
neither
the
pack;
the
companies
name
not
the
any
kind
information
is
given,
but
still
available.
In
railways
you
see
that
many
occurs
at
bring
selling
those
right,
but
the
thing
which
is
of
our
interest
is
that
those
are
not
getting
spoiled.
The
same
person
is
selling
everyday;
maybe
he
collected
7,
10
days
back,
but
still
it
is
selling.
If
the
package
it
is
not
bad
if;
that
means,
if
there
is
no
external
migration
of
moisture
from
outside;
then
though
it
is
remaining
same
because
its
moisture
content
is
very
low;
below
the
level
required
for
the
or ganisms
to
grow .
So,
we
say
that
is
why
we
are
saying
that
dramatically
it
varies
right;
right
from
98,
97
percent
in
leafy
vegetables
right
to
this
that
cereals,
pulses,
nuts
all
these
where
the
level
is
much
much
lower .
Now
this
moisture
suppress
meats
and
milk
have
high
water
content;
if
we
look
at
that
fresh
meat
and
milk;
their
water
content
is
very
very
high
where
or ganisms
can
easily
grows
that’ s
why
they
need
preservation
technique
right.
And
this
high
water
supposed
the
microbial
growth,
but
others
like
bread,
nut,
dried
foods
have
low
water
availability .
So,
there
or ganisms
growth
is
relatively
much
much
lower
or
at
a
lesser
rate
depending
on
the
moisture
level.
Selective
microbes
can
grow
in
these
specific
environments
right;
so,
we
come
to
water
activity
which
says
and
we
defined
earlier
also;
water
activity
in
all
practical
purposes,
we
define
as
the
in
this
way
as
the
ratio
of
partial
or
vapour
pressure
of
water
in
that
food,
vapour
pressure
of
water
in
that
food
at
a
temperature
that
temperature.
And
the
vapour
pressure
of
the
pure
water
at
that
temperature,
this
ratio
says
the
water
activity
at
the
temperature
in
that
food
right.
So,
water
activity
used
to
designate
amount
of
water
available
in
foods
which
we
are
repeatedly
saying.
So,
pure
water
has
an
water
activity
of;
has
a
water
activity
of
1.
Whereas,
most
bacteria
they
grow
at
a
water
activity
of
0.9
and
above,
most
fungi
or
fungi
require
water
activity
of
0.8
and
above
and
most
4
molds
require
water
activity
at
0.7
or
above
right.
So,
depending
on
their
water
activity
that
is
the
availability
or
in
turn
availability
of
moisture
for
the
or ganisms
to
grow ,
the
dif ferent
or ganisms
grow
at
dif ferent
moisture
level
right;
so
this
is
one
intrinsic
property .
So
let
us
go
to
the
others
because
if
we
discuss
in
one
only ,
then
we
will
be
stuck
of;
pH
pH
as
we
just
said
that
if
it
is
high
acidic
food
then
its
chance
of
getting
infected
by
or ganisms
are
much
lower
compared
to
those
whose
pH
or
acidity
is
much
much
higher
or
closer
to
neutral.
Because
in
the
beginning
we
said,
if
the
if
the
nutrition
or
nutrient
availability ,
moisture
availability
and
pH
level
net
neutral
foods
are
there;
they
are
the
most
ideal
for
the
microbes
to
grow .
So,
pH
has
a
great
influence
on
that
right;
so
we
can
say
that
pH
should
be
determined
to
know
which
or ganisms
can
survive
or
thrive
on
which
specific
food
right.
So,
many
microor ganisms
are
inhibited
by
acidic
conditions
right
exception
is
lactic
acid
bacteria.
The
other
day ,
I
was
saying
if
you
remember
that
lactic
acid
bacteria
they
are
using
the
lactose
in
milk
and
that
lactose
is
converted
into
lactic
acid.
Now
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
lactic
acid
is
being
produced
by
the
lactic
acid
bacteria.
And
lot
of
lactic
acid
is
bringing
down
the
pH,
now
under
that
conditions
other
or ganisms
cannot
come
in
and
get
into
that.
So,
lactic
acid
bacteria
is
producing
lactic
acid;
so,
which
of
course,
after
certain
time
these
or ganisms
also
will
not
survive
or
we
will
not
be
able
to
grow .
But
for
the
when
they
are
active;
others
cannot
come
and
because
the
acid
level
is
high
right.
So,
this
is
a
unique
thing
that
lactic
acid
bacteria,
they
can
grow
in
the
acidic
medium,
but
many
many
or ganisms
cannot
grow
right.
So,
lactic
acid
bacteria
used
in
fermentation
process
of
food
production
normally
in
many
cases
this
is
a
desirable;
in
some
cases
it
may
not
be
desirable
detrimental
depending
on
that
I
gave
the
example
of
knife.
So,
sometimes
you
can
use
it
for
good
cause,
sometimes
you
can
use
it
for
bad
cause.
So,
like
that
here
also
the
lactic
acid
can
be
or
bacteria
can
be
used
for
good
cause
or
that
is
fermentation
technology
or
can
be
there
they
can
be
they
can
be
seen
from
the
point
of
view
of
detrimental
or ganisms
or
which
can
cause
bad
to
the
food.
So,
depending
on
what,
how
you
are
looking
at,
where
is
the
use;
it
can
be
good
or
it
can
be
bad.
Also
prime
cause
of
spoilage
of
unpasteurized
milk
and
other
foods,
this
lactic
acid
or ganisms
are
also
as
we
said
the
example
you
keep
some
even
pasteurized
milk
also
if
you
keep
it
for
some
time
that
is
suf ficiently
if
you
give
time
then
that
milk
may
get
wrong
or
may
get
spoiled
right.Primarily
by
might
be
because
of
the
lactic
acid
producing
or ganisms,
but
if
it
is
not
if
it
is
not
pasteurized
then
from
the
source
where
from
you
are
bringing;
from
there
after
sometime
couple
of
hours,
it
will
get
wrong
because
of
this
lactic
acid
producing
or ganisms.
Fungi
available;
fungi
are
available
rather
to
survive
at
relatively
low
pH
right.
Fungi
are
able
to
survive
at
relatively
low
pH;
most
acid
food
spoil
from
fungal
contaminations
as
opposed
to
bacteria
that
is
the
again
another
thing
to
remember .
That
if
it
is
acidic
food,
then
it
may
not
have
that
much
threat
for
getting
spoiled
by
bacteria,
but
there
is
lot
of
possibilities
that
it
may
be
infected
by
fungus.
So,
fungi
maybe
there
and
it
may
cause
the
deteriorations;
so
you
have
to
take
care
not
the
bacteria,
but
the
fungus.
So,
because
they
can
also
some
of
them
can
also
tolerate
high
acid
food
or
high
acid
condition;
pH
can
determine
bacteria’ s
ability
to
product
produced
toxin;
that
is
again
some
p
high
if
it
is
high
pH,
then
may
not
be
the
product
which
is
desirable
are
being
formed.
Some
products
which
are
not
desirable
like
toxic
materials,
they
can
be
produced
by
the
or ganism
which
are
toxic;
so
that
is
not
desirable.
T oxin
production
of
many
or ganisms
is
inhibited
by
pH;
so
pH
is
one
of
the
regulating
factor .
So,
if
you
don’ t
want
toxin
to
be
toxin
to
be
produced
in
the
food;
so
that
pH
is
regulated
or
high.
One
of
the
best
example
is
at
home;
what
you
see
that
that
achaar
or
what
you
call
pickle
right;
so
those
pickles
are
at
very
low
pH
and
you
just
keep
on
the
table,
you
do
not
keep
it
in
the
refrigerator
also.
And
maybe
for
months
together
or
may
be
years
you
are
consuming
those
pickles,
there
are
primary
reason
it
is
having
high
pH
and
high
acidity .
So
that
is
not
allowing
other
or ganisms
to
grow
or
toxic
materials
to
grow
right.
From
pH,
let
us
now
move
to
others
like
nutrients
right.So,
nutrients
are
in
food
determine
nutrients
in
food
determine
what;
which
or ganisms
can
grow
in
which
food?
That
what
a
the
nutrient
is
available
in
which
food
that
will
dictate
which
or ganisms
will
grow
right.
Biological
barriers;
biological
barriers
like
rinds,
shells
and
other
outer
coverings
help
protect
foods
from
microbial
invasion
rinds;
means
that
hard
cover
like
the
shell
of
the
your
orange
right.
So,
they
are
called
rinds;
so
shells
like
your
egg
shell
right.
So,
these
are
this
covered,
this
protect
food
material
from
this
is
given
by
nature
from
the
invasion
of
the
or ganisms,
unless
there
is
some
abuse
or
something;
so
it
is
not
getting
spoiled
by
or ganisms,
so
easily .
Microor ganisms
will
eventually
breakdown
coverings
and
cause
spoilage
of
course,
is
it
is
for
sometime
but
not
for
all
the
time
because
some
or
other
kind
of
bruise
is
always
there
and
the
or ganisms
do
with
bend
and
ultimately
spoil
including
that
rind
also,
but
it
takes
long
time.
Some
antimicrobial
chemicals
are
also
controlling
or
af fecting
the
growth
like
some
foods
contain
some
natural
antimicrobial
chemicals
that
inhibit
growth
of
or ganisms
responsible
for
the
spoilage
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
some
other
because
we
would
like
to
complete
that
intrinsic
factor
ok.
So,
intrinsic
factors
we
have
completed
and
our
time
is
also
less;
so,
out
of
which
we
have
seen
that
for
the
intrinsic
factors
primarily
it
is
the
moisture
which
determines
a
lot,
then
the
nutrients.
And
after
the
nutrients
it
is
the
pH
which
af fects
directly
and
if
there
are
some
chemicals
which
act
as
the
antimicrobial
agent.
So,
these
are
the
factors;
intrinsic
factors
which
control
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms’
right?
So,
the
extrinsic
factor
which
will
come;
we
will
do
it
in
the
next
class
ok.
Thank
you.
