Packaging
So,
we
are
discussing
about
the
different
packaging
right.
So,
for
food
materials
after
it
is
being
produced
before
it
is
selling,
it
is
being
packed.
So,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Products,
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
in
lecture
number
59
we
now,
come
to
the
packaging
which
is
recently
coming
up
as
Modified
Atmosphere
Packaging
or
that
can
be
told
in
short
as
MAP
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:59)
So,
this
Modified
Atmosphere
Packaging
right,
is
not
very-very
age
old,
though
the
technique
has
come
up
very
recently .
But,
I
cannot
claim
that
it
was
not
also
available
earlier ,
the
same
thing
was
available,
but
it
was
not
nurtured.
So,
now
a
days,
it
is
being
nurtured
and
looked
or
being
looked
into
in
that
way
right.
So,
as
we
said
what
is
the
genesis
of
this?
As
we
said
that,
when
you
are
doing
vacuum
packaging
or
flushing
with
nitrogen,
that
time
you
are
removing
oxygen
right.
Why
you
are
removing?
Because,
oxygen
is
primarily
it
is
helping
the,
anaerobic
organisms
as
well
it
is
doing
the
oxidative
changes.
So,
this
is
not
desirable
right.1
Now ,
you
just
think
this
way
that
of
course,
I
am
against
using
plastic,
because
that
is
spoiling
the
really
this
is
spoiling
the
entire
environment
and
some
alternative
should
come
up.
Someday ,
I
believe
it
will
come
up,
because
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention.
So,
for
that
someday ,
when
all
over
the
world
people
will
be
very
much
like
the
like
people
now
are
cautious
about
this,
zones
sphere
right
and
this
though
a
someday
and
global
warming.
These
kind
of
sensational
things
when
it
will
come
to
the
world,
plastic
also
will
be
left
aside.
Some
alternative
has
to
come,
but
yes
as
of
today
plastic
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
our
daily
life
who
just
cannot
avoid
it
at
the
moment.
So,
in
that
case,
say
you
have
taken
one
guava
right
or
now
it
is
the
mango
time.
This
is
the
mango
time
in
India.
So,
you
have
one
mango
and
you
have
wrapped
that
mango
with
the,
with
one
polymeric
film
right.
So,
that
polymeric
film
of
course
many
things
are
to
be
said,
but
from
the
bird’ s
eye
view
what
we
can
say
that,
the
chance
you
have
wrapped
with
the
polymeric
film.
So,
that
is
making
a
barrier
between
the
mango
and
the
outside
atmosphere.
Outside
atmosphere
what
do
you
have
air,
what
it
has
21
%oxygen
and
79
%nitrogen.
Whereas,
inside
what
did
you
do
you
have
put
a
wrapper
and
this
mango
being
a
product
which
respires
right,
because
you
have
seen
that
mango
where
it
is
in
the
unripen
form
it
is
green
and
when
it
is
in
the
ripen
form,
it
is
yellow
right.
So,
this
stage
of
ripening
is
happening,
because
of
its
taking
respiration.
It
is
doing
respiration
and
that
is
reading,
it
is
to
ripening
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:13)
2
So,
what
you
do,
in
control
atmosphere
storage
you
extend.
Let
me
just
give
a
tau.
What
do
you
do
this?
You
make
a
plot
right.
This
is
oxygen
uptake
and
this
is
time
right.
So,
the
moment
you
have
plucked
from
the
tree
your
say
the
mango
which,
we
are
talking
about
it
had
a
respiration
rate
here
right
and
it
was
absolutely
green
in
colour
right.
So,
it
is
not
ripen
on
the
tree
you
have
you
have
plucked
it;
so,
that
you
can
keep
it
for
a
longer
period
right.
Now ,
from
here,
when
you
plucked
it
what
it
does,
because
in
the
new
environment,
this
fruit
that
take
some
time.
The
same
as
our
all
mammalians
or
our
child
are
coming
into
the
earth
when
they
are
taking
birth
from
the
mother
womb,
this
is
cut
right;
that
umbilical
cord
is
cut,
that
was
detached
from
the
mother
earlier
everything
was
being
supported
by
the
mother .
Now
it
has
to
be
on
its
own
the
baby .
Same
is
with
the
mango,
when
it
was
in
the
tree
it,
everything
was
supplied
by
the
mother
tree,
but
when
this
you
have
plucked
out
and
you
started
from
here
right.
So,
it
takes
some
time
to
acclimatize
right
that
is
why
the
respiration
rate
comes
down
and
then
when
it
acclimatizes
right
this
how
the
you
cannot
quantified
unless
you
do
experiment
right
you
cannot
quantify
unless
embarrassment
that
is
why
it
is
a
tentative
or,
or
one
representative
line
right.
So,
it
is
then
going
up
and
then
reaches
a
maximum
and
then
it
starts
declining
right.
So,
this
call
resents
coming
to
the
senescence
and
the
entire
ripening
that
take
this
is
the
process
where
your
ripening
is
taking
place
right.
This
is
the
process
where
your
ripening
is
taking
place
right
and
from
green.
This
was
green,
now
it
has
become
yellow
and
also
eatable.
That
is
soft
also
right.
It
has
become
soft
yellow
and
you
can
eat.
So,
now,
what
it
is
assume
that,
you
have
tied
this
end
to
one
and
you
have
tied
this
end
to
another
and
now
you
stretch
it,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:46)
3Now
you
stretch
it.
So,
if
you
stretch,
it
then
it
can
be
said
that
this
curve,
if
you
can
make
like
this
right
then
the
number
of
days
by
which
it
was
getting
ripened.
This
is
number
of
say,
days
by
which
it
was
getting
ripen.
Now ,
you
have
made
it
to
that;
so,
you
have
extended
the
life
if
it
was
for
say
5
days,
now
if
you
can
make
it
say,
50
days
right.
So,
5
days,
you
have
made
it
to
50
days
this
is
time
and
this
is
that,
rate
of
oxygen
uptake
right.
So,
if
we
do
this
then
that
is
what
you
are
doing
in
the
control
or
Modified
Atmosphere.
So,
in
Modified
Atmosphere,
what
we
are
referring
to
I
cannot
draw
the
mango
in
better
way
say,
this
is
the
mango
and
you
have
put
to
one
wrapper
right.
You
have
put
one
wrapper .
So,
ambient
this
ambient
is
with
air
which
contains
21
%oxygen
and
79
%nitrogen
right
whereas,
this
inside
it
has
little
oxygen
definitely ,
because
the
quantity
or
volume
of
the
air
inside
is
very-very
negligible
right.
So,
that
will
not
allow
the
oxidative
changes
in
the
mango
as
well
the
ripening
or
growth
of
the
organisms
or
the
ripening
of
the
mango.
So,
what
will
happen
this
mango,
in
respect
how
this,
whatever
be
oxygen
was
there
you
just
imagine
another
similar
case
that
on
this
or
sea
level
you
have
plenty
of
air
and
oxygen.
So,
you
are
breathing
as
and
when
as
much
you
can
right.
Now
you
just
imagine,
if
you
have
been
fine,
if
you
have
not
been
then
imagine
that
you
are
taken
to
by
some
means,
you
are
taken
to
the
highest
peak
say
Mount
Everest
right
and
in
that
Mount
Everest,
Oxygen
level
is
very-very
low.
So,
what
you
will
die?
No,
you
will
not
die
the
moment
you
reach
there,
because
there
you
will
try
to
acclimatize
with
the
changed
condition
and
your
rate
of
respiration
will
go
down
right
your
breathing4
also
will
go
down.
So,
here
since,
oxygen
is
not
available.
So,
what
do
you
do;
your
breathing
then
becomes
less.
So,
here
also
since
of
train
is
not
there
available.
So,
it
is
breathing
will
be
reduced
so;
that
means,
you
are
stretching
like
this
right
you
are
trying
to
stretch
the
curve
like
this
right
and
the
moment
you
are
doing
that
then
had
this
mango
you
bought
it
from
the
market
today
green
maybe
by
3-4
days
it
has
become
yellow ,
but
if
you
have
kept
it
like
this
then
it
maybe
instead
of
3-4
days
it
could
be
10,
15
days
after
it
is
becoming
yellow .
So,
you
have
extended
the
life.
So,
that
is
the
crunch
of
the
entire
modified
atmosphere
packaging
this
is
the
basis
right.
So,
now,
let
us
look
into,
all
detail
what
we
are
saying.
So,
actually
not
so,
much,
a
custom;
so,
that
is
why
now
let
us
look
into
actually
how
Modified
Atmosphere
Packaging
is
being
done
right.
So,
Modified
Atmosphere
Packaging
or
MAP ,
the
genesis
we
have
already
said
normally
air
that
contains
21
%oxygen
and
0.03
%carbon
dioxide.
It
was
found
that
low
oxygen
high
carbon
dioxide
levels
slow
ripening,
reduced
the
development
of
some
peel
disorders
and
inhibit
pathogen
growth.
So,
MAP
who
was
first
recorded
in
1927
as
an
extension
of
the
shelf
life
of
apples
by
storing
them
in
atmospheres
with
reduced
oxygen
and
increased
carbon
dioxide
concentrations.
In
UK
Marks
and
Spencer
introduced
MAP
meat
in
1979
in
1981
bacon
fish
both
fresh
and
cured
sliced
cooked
meats
were
introduced
into
the
commercial
right.
So,
gradually
it
is
coming
up
to
the
market
and
maybe
someday
it
will
be
also
extended
to
many-many
other
products.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

5
So,
what
is
then
meant
by
MAP
which
we
have
already
discussed
in
detail
let
us
see
what
we
are
trying
to
say
here
we
are
saying
that
modified
atmosphere
packaging
or
MAP
is
a
long
established
and
continuously
increasing
technique
for
extending
the
shelf
life
or
fresh
food
products.
It
requires
specialized
machinery
to
flush
out
air
from
the
packaging
and
replace
it
with
the
different
gas
mixture
MAP
aims
to
provide
longer
shelf
life
maintain
sensory
attributes
like
colour
or
appearance
and
achieved
the
food
safety
of
the
product.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
15:41)
Gases
used
in
MAP
and
their
functions
are
like
this
carbon
dioxide
gas
is
views
it
reveals
the
increase
of
most
aerobic
bacteria
and
is
the
most
important
gas
in
MAP .
Tentatively
the
higher
the
carbon
dioxide
the
longer
the
durability
of
the
perishable
food.
Then
nitrogen
and
inert
gas
used
to
explain
here,
especially
oxygen
out
of
the
packaging
used
as
a
filling
gas
to
equalize
the
effect
of
carbon
dioxide
absorption
by
the
perishable
oxygen
should
be
excluded
from
MAP
except
some
cases
where
it
can
bring
positive
results
in
food
preservation
helps
in
keeping
colour
mates
resolution
possible.
6
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:47)
Then
Nobel
MAP
gaseous
used
are
like
this
high
oxygen
MAP
argon
and
nitrous
oxide
N
2
O
MAP .
These
are
some
of
the
gaseous
which
can
be
used
instead
of
oxygen
and
extend
the
life,
but;
obviously ,
argon
is
not
available
everywhere,
but
this
is
one
technique
which
can
be
used
right.
If
it,
if
argon
could
be
made
available
everywhere
is
good,
but
it
is
the
scientific
process
where
you
can
do
it
right.
High
oxygen
MAP
inhibits
particular
enzymatic
discoloration
prevents
anaerobic
fermentation
argon
and
nitrous
oxide
nitrous
oxide
by
the
by
you
know
in
school
you
have
seen
nitrous
oxide
you
call
it
to
be
laughing
gas
you
know .
So,
these
are
classified
as
miscellaneous
additives
particularly
in
European
countries
or
European
Union’ s
right.
Argon
can
more
effectively
inhibit
enzymatic
activities
microbial
growth
and
degraded
deep
chemical
reactions
in.
Some
of
the
perishables
argon
and
nitrous
oxide
increase
the
shelf
life
by
reducing
the
fungal
growth
right.
I
am
moving
a
little
fast
the
reserving
a
lot
of
things
that
we
show
time
is
very
limited.

A
gas
composition
used
in

for
different
agricultural
product
is

the

that
depends

So,
these
way
different
gas
compositions
you
can
maintain
and
you
can
provide,
the
extension
of
the
life
accordingly
right.

(Refer
Slide
Time:
21:37)
Now
it
comes
how
you
will
make
it
right
compensated
vacuum
use
for
MAP
is
like
this.
That
removes
air
from
inside
the
package
and
then
breaking
the
vacuum
with
the
desert
gas
mixtures
replacement
of
air
being
done
in
two
stage
stages
speed
up
a
speed
of
operation
is
much
lower
than
the
gas
flush
technique.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:10)
For
oxygen
sensitive
food
materials
compensated
vacuum
is
the
best
choice.
Then
the
machineries
which
are
involved
in
MAP
are
like
that
thermo
this
is
the
Thermo
Forming
9
Packaging
machine,
then
vacuum
creating
machine
then
form
fill
seal
machine
either
horizontal
or
vertical.
So,
the
thermo
forming
machine
looks
like
this
right.
This
is
the
schematic
of
course;
this
is
the
schematic
one
right.
So,
it
is,
forming
right.
So,
thermo
forming,
this
is
going
like
that
and
then
ultimately
with
the
product
it
will
come
out
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:55)
Then,
some
other
like
vacuum
packaging;
here,
you
are
you
are
keeping
this
thing
and
that
is
connected
to
a,
vacuum
right.
That
is
connected
to
a
vacuum.
So,
it
is
sucking
and
the
composition
air
is
from
there
is
being
sucked
right.
And
then
form
fill
seal
machine,
it
can
be
horizontal
or
it
can
be
vertical.
10
(Refer
Slide
Time:
23:28)
So,
vertical
is
this
one
and
the
horizontal
is
this
one.
So,
you
see
it
is
going
like
that
and
then,
this
part
is
also
coming
along
with
it
and
making
the
selling
and
this
is
the
seal
product
right.
You
see,
how
it
is
coming
out
and
that
seal
product
is
going
like
that.
So,
this
is
horizontal.
Similarly ,
for
vertical
your
packets
are
coming
like
this
packets
are
coming
like
this
and
then
this
form
making,
this
is
from
their
role
it
is
coming
and
making
this
and
getting
it
cut,
here
and
you
get
the
similar
product
like
this
is
the
form
seal
fill
and
seal
machine
right;
both
horizontal
as
well
as
vertical
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:51)
11
So,
when
it
is
coming
like
that,
then
what
you
need,
what
you
need
is
that,
this
fill
and
seal.
Once,
that
is
done,
then
the
flush
gas
flush
technique
is
another
one.
So,
which
we
have
already
said
that
with
the
nitrogen
gas
you
are
flushing
off
right.
So,
gas
flush
technique
that
comes
in
like
this
the,
that
normally
accomplished
on
a
form
fill
seal
machine
air
replacement
inside
a
package
is
performed
by
a
continuous
gas
by
and
large
inert
stream
atmosphere
surrounding
the
food
product
is
gradually
flushed
off.
Key
factor
is
the
speed
of
the
machine
and
process
being
continuous
finished
product.
Obtaining
rate
is
very
-very
high
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:53)
Then
we
come
to
this
level
that,
the
what
are
the
then
advantages
of
the
MAP
the
advantages
of
the
MAP
is
like
this
longer
durability
of
perishable
food
or
decrease
of
spoilage
germ
growth
is
reduced
for
when
texture
of
the
product
is
retained.
Natural
colour
of
the
product
is
preserved
need
to
use
preservative
is
greatly
reduced
shelf
life
of
the
product
is
extended
and
economics
of
the
system.
That
depends
on
the
extend
of
expansion
of
the
storage
life
of
the
product.
Now ,
how
much
you
are
extending
that
will
dictate
how
much
money
is
going
to
be
involved.
Some
disadvantages
are
always
there,
because
any
advantage
has
to
have
some
disadvantage
light
with
dark
that
is
a
must
right.
12
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:51)
So,
it
is
not
that,
it
is
always
one
way
both
way
generally
in
sometimes
both
are
equal,
sometimes
one
predominates
very
high
and
sometimes
the
other
one
predominates;
so,
depending
on
the
situation.
So,
disadvantages
are
like
this
that
capital
cost
of
the
gas
packaging
machineries
right.
Cost
of
gases
and
packaging
materials
are
also
high.
Cost
of
analytical
equipment's
to
monitor
the
quantity
of
the
recorded
gas
mixture
or
correct,
correct
the
gas
mixtures
that
analytical
equipment's
are
also
costly .
Cost
of
instruments
to
ensure
the
quality
of
the
product
transport
cost
going
to
increased
packaging
volume,
because
you
have
given
a
wrapper .
So,
that
is
increasing
the
volume.
So,
that
in
turn
will
increase
the
transport
cost
of
the
material
which
comes
under
the
total
cost
of
the
material
is
being
sold,
right.
Then
increase
a
increased
retail
display
space
going
to
increase
package
volume
potential
danger
due
to
growth
of
food
borne
pathogens.
Going
to
abused
in
temperature
by
retailers
as
well
as
consumers.
So,
this
I
have
been
saying,
that
this
is
the
a
prevention
of
all
the
scientists.
All
the
people,
that
abused
of
the
process
that
abused
I
gave
the
example
of
these,
our
normal
malls
and
others
where
frozen
materials
are
kept
in
the
freezer ,
but
the
top
is
opened
right.
So,
this
is
simply
abuse
of
the
system
that
is
not
desirable
here
also
like
that.
Benefits
of
MAP
is
lost
once
the
package
is
open
or
gets
leak,
because
you
have
put
one
wrapper
as
we
have
shown.
So,
in
that
wrapper ,
once
it
gets
leak
then
the
external,
ambience
that
goes
in.
13
So,
your
entire
effort
entire
packaging
entire
cost
that
goes
out.
So,
you
have
to
be
careful
that
there
is
no
piercing
of
the
material
packaging
material
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:52)
So,
hopefully
with
this
high
oxygen
MAP
with
this
we
come
to
the
end
of
this
class.
And,
we
say
that
packaging
can
be
of
different
now
packaging
industry
has
come
up
to
the
market
into
the
way,
that
more
than
the
product
packaging
is,
I
mean
dominating
rather .
So,
I
do
not
feel
personally
as
scientists
that
should
be,
but
packaging
definitely
improves
the
life.
So,
the
way
packaging
is
getting
developed
the
way
new
and
new
packaging
techniques
are
coming
in,
hopefully
someday
that
will
replace
the
use
of
the
plastics
or
polymers
ok.
Thank
you.
