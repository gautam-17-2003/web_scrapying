Carbohydrates
in
Milk
So,
in
the
previous
class
we
had
been
discussing
components
of
milk
and
we
were
at
carbohydrates
of
milk,
right.
So,
in
this
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology ,
in
this
course
I
mean
lecture
number
34
we
still
do
with
the
carbohydrates
in
milk,
right.
So,
we
stopped
at
some
place
where
we
saw
that
the
major
carbohydrate
in
milk
is
lactose,
and
this
lactose
we
normally
called
it
to
be,
and
if
you
remember
sometime
we
said
that
this
is
the
only
natural
product
where
the
only
one
carbohydrate
is
there.
The
reason
being
because
others
are
so
small
in
quantity ,
so
they
are
negligible,
and
that
to
since
lactose
is
there
and
we
know
the
chemistry
of
that
that
on
hydrolysis
of
lactose
it
produces
glucose
and
galactose.
So,
one
molecule
of
water
fuse
comes
out
when
glucose
and
galactoses
are
fused
to
for
the
lactose.
So,
lactose
on
hydrolysis
in
any
case
produces
that
no
I
am
not
saying
lactose
is
so
easy
to
hydrolyze
into
galactose
and
glucose,
but
there
could
be
some
possibility
and
also
it
could
be
naturally
already
present
there,
but
the
quantity
is
so
less
that
we
consider
that
milk
has
a
single
carbohydrate
that
is
the
lactose,
right.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
how
much
quantity
it
has.Minerals
in
milk
is
about
0.7
to
0.8
percent,
0.7
to
0.8
percent
of
sodium,
potassium,
calcium
oh
sorry;
sodium,
potassium,
chloride
which
are
readily
dif fusible
and
their
concentrations
are
negatively
correlated
with
the
lactose,
right.
So,
what
does
it
mean?
That
their
concentrations
are
negatively
correlated
with
lactose;
that
means,
if
lactose
concentration
goes
up
then
these
availability
of
these
minerals
are
less.
So,
that
is
why
negatively
correlated
with
the
lactose,
right.
And
generally
the
sodium,
potassium
and
chloride
they
are
available
as
the
free
ions.
So,
they
can
also
as
and
when
required
they
can
also
joined
with
others
whenever
it
is
required.
So,
this
free
ions
sodium,
potassium,
calcium
chlorine
chloride
rather
it
should
be,
so
out
of
which
two
are
anions
I
two
are
cations
and
one
is
anions.
So,
they
can
they
can
bind
with
many
others
as
and
when
required.
Now ,
concentrations
of
calcium
magnesium
ionize
phosphate
and
citrate
depend
on
the
casein
content
in
milk,
right,
so
that
means,
if
the
casein
content
is
high
then
we
get
more
calcium,
more
magnesium
and
more
phosphate
these
we
get
more
the
reason
being
when
we
have
covered
casein
you
have
seen
that
this
minerals
they
are
clubbed
with
the
casein,
right.
They
are
clubbed
with
the
casein;
they
are
forming
the
bond
with
casein
thatâ€™ s
why
if
the
casein
is
high
or
concentration
of
casein
is
high
our
corresponding
this
mineral
availability
is
also
high,
right.
So,
more
casein,
more
calcium,
and
more
phosphate
and
more
magnesium,
so
calcium,
magnesium,
phosphate
are
related
with
the
casein
positively
that
more
calcium
more
this
ions
or
this
minerals
we
get,
right.
Then
concentration
of
citrate
varies
depending
on
the
season
and
feed
of
the
animal.
So,
whatever
be
the
animal
if
it
is
cow .
Normally
that
milk
synonym
we
have
cow
because
all
almost
all
of
us
due
drink
this
cow
milk
here
many
a
others
also
due
drink
buf falo
or
maybe
some
other
animals
like
goat
or
etcetera
etcetera
wherever
it
is
available.
But
by
and
lar ge
in
general
we
make
that
milk
as
a
synonym
of
the
cow
that
is
milk
means
cow
it
is
the
cow
milk.
So,
it
depends
on
the
season
and
also
the
feed,
right.
The
citrate
concentration
availability
depends
on
the
feed
as
well
the
season,
right.
It
is
not
throughout
the
casein,
the
same
concentration
of
citrates
will
be
available
as
well
if
the
cow
is
or
the
animal
is
fed
with
good
material
then
you
will
have
one
kind
of
citrate
concentration,
and
if
it
is
best
on
the
pasture
which
is
available
in
nature
here
and
there,
so
the
that
be
then
another
kind
of
citrate
concentration
he
will
get.
So,
these
two
directly
af fect
the
citrate
concentration
availability
in
milk,
ok.
Then
which
af fect
the
soluble
calcium
content
and
milk
stability ,
that
citrate
concentration
is
here,
is
dictating
or
is
monitoring
the
availability
of
the
calcium.
So,
if
the
citrate
is
available
that
is
much
better
because
it
is
also
soluble
calcium
content
that
will
be
dictated
by
the
concentration
of
the
citrate.
There
is
an
equilibrium
between
colloidal
dispersion
and
salts.
Normally
salts
we
mean
that
by
enlar ge
salt
we
mean
that
it
is
soluble
in
water ,
by
enlar ge
I
am
not
saying
all
salts
are
soluble
there
are
many
soluble
salts,
there
are
many
sparingly
soluble
salts
there
are
many
soluble
salts
which
are
not
soluble
at
all,
right.
Of
course,
at
all
cannot
be
because
it
is
it
is
it
is
relative,
right.
So,
whether
it
is
in
ppm
or
pbm
means
parts
per
million
or
parts
per
billion
or
even
lower .
So,
that
is
dif ferent.
Normally
is
not
to
the
level
of
ppm,
pbm
we
say
that
this
is
soluble
that
means,
it
is
having
good
concentration.
So,
that
is
being
controlled
the
calcium,
we
said
that
calcium
is
bound
with
the
casein.
So,
the
casein
is
dictating
the
availability
of
the
calcium,
but
the
citrate
concentration
is
also
dictating
availability
of
calcium
in
the
soluble
pairs,
right.
So,
the
calcium
availability
in
the
soluble
pairs
is
dictated
by
the
citrate
concentration
and
which
may
contribute
which
may
dictate
or
which
may
control
the
equilibrium
between
the
salt
and
the
colloidal
state,
right.So,
if
the
colloidal
equilibrium
is
destabilized
then
concentration
of
minerals
may
af fect
the
processing,
right,
obviously ,
when
you
are
processing
milk
processing
normally
it
is
with
respect
to
heat
treatment
by
and
lar ge.
So,
milk
is
first
heated
you
you
will
not
see
any
other
that
milk
without
heat
treatment
it
is
crude
and
kept
at
low
temperature.
The
reason
we
have
said
earlier ,
but
since
it
has
come
a
repetition
it
could
be,
but
maybe
recapitulation
for
you
that
the
reason
is
milk
contains
lot
of
enzymes,
lot
of
microbes.
So,
they
may
spoil
milk
if
they
are
not
deactivated
before
it
is
cold.
So,
that
is
why
the
first
step
whatever
you
do
with
milk
is
the
heating,
right.
Now ,
when
you
are
heating,
this
disturbance
of
the
colloidal
solution
that
may
af fect
the
process
because
if
something
comes
out
from
the
from
the
from
the
medium
that
is
milk
then
your
that
process
may
be
af fected,
both
in
terms
of
heat
or
mass
transfer .
So,
in
that
case
you
are
your
destabilization
of
the
equilibrium
of
the
colloidal
state
is
must
or
is
af fecting
your
process,
right,
which
require
that
the
addition
of
anions
to
bind
to
ionic
calcium
that
would
restabilize
the
casein
against
aggregation,
right.
So,
as
we
said
that
if
casein
is
I
mean
destabilize
that
is
casein
is
in
the
colloidal
state
and
that
to
with
calcium.
So,
if
the
destabilization
is
taking
place
and
if
that
is
not
again
brought
back
will
bring
back
that
this
ion
that
is
anions
which
are
available.
So,
citrate
is
one
such
anion.
So,
that
anion
will
help
to
bind
back
the
calcium
interned,
interned
your
casein
and
the
stability
of
the
colloid
will
be
brought
back.
That
is
why
the
concentration
of
citrate
is
so
important
that
it
will
help
stabili
making
the
equilibrium
between
the
between
this
colloidal
state
and
the
solution
state.
So,
this
citrate
is
playing
and
very
important
role
in
stabilizing
the
colloids
in
the
milk,
right.Now ,
at
sometimes
salt
is
also
added,
salt
is
also
added
as
an
additive
in
certain
dairy
products.
This
salt
is
added
the
concentration
of
calcium
in
milk
is
relatively
high
and
for
this
reason
milk
is
considered
to
be
very
important
source
of
calcium.
Primary
salts
in
milk
are
phosphates,
citrate,
chlorides
and
sulphates,
carbonates,
bicarbonates
of
sodium,
potassium,
calcium,
magnesium,
right.
So,
in
as
we
were
saying
and
the
that
the
stability
of
the
stability
of
the
your
this
thing,
stability
of
colloid
this
colloidal
stability
for
that
sometimes
some
salt
may
be
added
externally ,
right.
And
this
external
salt
addition
will
help
to
stabilize
the
colloidal
suspension
of
milk.
If
required,
again
I
am
saying
if
required
because
when
your
processing
and
processing
is
with
respect
to
heating.
So,
if
heating
during
that
if
there
is
some
disturbance
in
the
colloid
then
casein
will
come
out.
So,
losing
calcium,
losing
casein,
so
there
to
be
brought
back
to
the
colloidal
state
or
in
equilibrium
between
colloid
and
the
solution
so
that
can
be
done
by
the
addition
of
this
salt.
And
normally
milk
contains
these
phosphates
citrates,
phosphates
citrates,
chlorides
then
sulphates
carbonates,
bicarbonates
of
sodium,
potassium,
magnesium,
calcium
all
this,
right.
Of
course
level
of
salt
is
not
equivalent
to
the
level
of
minerals.
How
much
salt
is
added
or
how
much
salt
is
there
in
milk
of
course,
it
does
not
tell,
I
mean
it
is
not
it
is
not
proportional
that
so
much
salt
means
so
much
mineral
available
reason
being
some
minerals
could
be
bound
which
may
not
be
available
for
other
activities.
So,
it
just
cannot
be
said
directly
that
salt
concentration
or
salt
present
is
equivalent
to
so
much
of
the
mineral
availability .
Level
of
salt
is
also
by
no
means
equivalent
to
ash
content
as
we
said
when
the
very
beginning
that
milk
do
have
basically
the
nutrients
basic
nutrients
that
is
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate,
then
vitamins,
minerals,
and
water .
And
this
and
these
vitamins
minerals
water
there
not
water
is
shown
separately
when
it
is
in
tabular
form,
but
it
is
said
that
water
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate
and
ash
content,
right.
So,
ash
content
we
have
seen
it
varied
very
widely
maybe
from
decimal
to
some
units,
right,
so
depending
on
the
source
etcetera.
So,
the,
but
it
does
not
collaborate
that
if
ash
content
is
high
that
will
dictate
the
mineral
content
is
also
high,
right.
There
are
many
others
for
which
the
ash
content
could
be
high,
but
the
mineral
content
may
not
collaborate
with
the
high
concentration
or
high
availability ,
high
in
number
of
ash
content,
right.
So,
that
you
have
to
keep
in
mind.
This
may
be
due
to
the
many
others
which
due
are
not
in
the
family
of
fat
protein
carbohydrate.
So,
they
may
come
crude
fiber
crude
things,
so
they
may
come
into
the
ash
content.
So,
this
ash
content
does
not
reflect
the
availability
of
the
minerals,
right.
So,
this
influencing
factors
for
salt
composition
are
species,
bread
of
species,
stage
of
lactation
and
feed,
so
obviously ,
salt
concentration
varies
depending
on
species
bread
of
species
stage
of
lactation
and
also
the
feed.
Stage
of
lactation
is
one
vital
parameter ,
feed
is
another
vital
parameter
though
species
and
bread
are
also,
but
feed
is
definitely
a
vital
parameter
because
as
far
as
unor ganized
sectors
are
there,
so
individual
rearing
of
these
animals
are
there.
So,
it
is
everybody
wants
that
give
less,
get
more.
So,
the
cow
is
feed
with
the
minimum
or
from
the
natural
sources
and
we
want
maximum
output
from
the
top,
right,
that
is
not
possible,
whereas
in
many
many
countries
in
many
many
I
donâ€™ t
say
developed
under
developed
because
that
has
no
meaning.
In
many
many
countries
there
are
that
consolidated
or
concise
or
collectively
the
raring
of
these
animals
and
their
feed
is
well
controlled,
with
all
other
parameters
feed
is
also
well
control,
well
feed
and
they
do
give
really
good
quality
and
quantity
because
it
is
not
only
the
quality ,
but
also
the
quantity
that
will
be
dictated
by
the
feed
and
of
course,
other
parameters
like
your
the
bread
or
the
species
or
maybe
the
period
of
lactation
or
many
others,
right.
So,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
feed
is
a
primary .
So,
wherever
possible,
wherever
possible
try
to
try
to
impress
on
the
people
who
are
raring
that
if
they
should
allow
the
animal
to
be
with
proper
feed,
right,
to
be
fed
with
the
proper
feed
that
will
also
give
you
intern
goodreturn
of
the
quality
and
the
quantity
of
the
food
of
the
of
the
milk,
right.
So,
this
you
must
convey
or
you
must
pursue,
right,
ok.
Now ,
remaining
portions
together
with
magnesium
are
partly
in
suspension
and
partly
in
solution
this
remaining
portion
I
am
saying
that
with
respect
to
perhaps
the
casein
content,
right.
Small
portion
of
sulphur
enters
into
no,
this
is
with
respect
to
wave
protein
sorry
with
respect
to
wave
protein,
right.
So,
small
portion
of
sulphur
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
casein
and
lactalbumin
oh
this
is
with
respect
to
the
mineral
content,
right.
So,
this
is
small
portion
of
sulphur
and
that
enters
into
small
portion
of
sulphur
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
casein
and
lactalbumin,
right,
all
the
needs
of
an
adult
that
is
why
it
is
not
the
complete
food,
right.
Now
minor
constituents
which
are
there
in
milk
are
minor
constitutes
which
are
there
in
milk
are
yellow
colour
of
milk
is
due
to
a
pigment
known
as
carotene
that
is
the
pigment
which
is
available
in
milk,
phospholipids
that
is
lecithin
this
lecithin
is
the
fat
like
substance
containing
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
and
this
lecithin
is
the
is
the
binder
between
the
fat
and
water ,
right.
So,
this
is
the
intermediate
between
fat
and
water
and
or
mediator
between
fat
and
water
to
be
in
the
same
platform
in
the
same
place.
So,
that
that
lecithin
is
another
small
constituents
of
milk.
Fishy
flavour
of
butter ,
a
common
defect
is
due
to
the
decomposition
of
this
lecithin.
Sometimes,
sometimes
there
may
be
some
fishy
flavour
availability
or
fishy
flavour
may
come
up,
so
that
is
primarily
due
to
this
decomposition
of
lecithin
and
subsequently
turns
to
be
maybe
TMA,
that
is
trimethylamine
or
TMA
or
trimethylamine
oxide
by
which
normally
fish
is
a
recognized
or
fish
is
judged
whether
it
is
already
it
has
gone
wrong
or
it
is
it
is
spoiled
or
it
has
started.
So,
that
number
TMA,
TMA
oh
helps,
but
this
is
the
obnoxious
smell
is
primarily
due
to
the
decomposition
of
this
lecithin
to
those
amines,
right.
In
the
in
the
in
the
splitting
of
lecithin
trimethylamine
is
formed
which
is
responsible
for
this
fishy
flavour
as
we
discussed
that
this
fishy
flavour
is
primarily
due
to
the
trimethylamine
which
is
obtained
by
the
decomposition
of
the
lecithin,
right.
Then
some
other
small
quantity
small
portions
of
dif ferent
materials
are
like
cholesterol,
right.
Cholesterol
is
also
one
material
which
is
available
in
milk.
So,
and
milk
contents
around
105
to
175
or
76
parts
per
million,
right,
parts
per
million,
so
105
to
176
parts
per
million
cholesterol
is
there.
Just
for
your
just
for
your
rather
information
I
tried
to
give
that
is
why
said
as
an
as
an
you
see
how
complicated
there
are.
This
lecithin
is
this
lecithin
is
this
with
a
phosphoric
acid
group,
right.
And
there
is
also
the
other
one
that
is
you
have
hydrophilic
and
hydrophobic
both
are
there,
right.
And
similarly
cephalin
another
is
this
is
also
used
as
your
binder
that
is
between
fat
and
fat
and
water .
So,
you
see
how
though
it
is
on
the
on
another
another
background.
So,
thatâ€™ s
why
some
portion
is
not
visible,
but
this
is
of
course,
this
is
CH
3,
this
is
also
CH
3.
And
this
is
the
cholesterol
you
see
how
many
how
many
numbers
of
this
your
6
member
or
5
member
rings
are
there
as
well
the
side
chains
are
also
there,
so
it
is
complex,
cholesterol
is
also
complex,
lecithin
is
complex,
then
cephalin
is
complex,
these
are
very
complex
compounds,
right.
And
I
donâ€™ t
expect
that
he
will
also
remember
them.
So,
big
big
things
are
not
required
because
as
and
when
you
need
you
can
go
back
to
their
and
you
can
tell,
right.
So,
if
we
go
back
to
there,
so
let
me
bring
back
this
to
its
original
position
there
is
a
saying
if
you
have
a
knife
you
can
use
it
to
cut
your
hand
or
you
can
use
it
for
some
good
purposes,
right,
so
ok.
So,
cholesterol
is
this
is
what
that
I
reference
to
this
advanced
technology
for
this
interaction
with
you,
this
advanced
technology
when
you
are
using
obviously ,
we
have
to
be
also
accustomed
with
that
and
a
little
time
also
has
to
be
given.
So,
cholesterol
is
around
105
to
176
parts
per
million.
Since
our
time
for
this
class
is
almost
over
a
will
also
come
back
to
cholesterol
in
the
next
class
start
with
that,
but
before
that
let
me
also
tell
this
that
nowadays
earlier
we
had
a
mind
in
our
mind
that
cholesterol
is
bad
there
is
a
ldl
and
hdl.
And
depending
on
this
high
density
lipid
or
low
density
lipid
depending
on
that,
so
people
use
to
take
their
food
etcetera
etcetera.
But
recently
some
scientific
investigation
I
have
said
that
no
it
is
not
the
cholesterol,
so
is
not
so
bad
as
it
was
thought
of
that
it
is
like
a
giant
it
will
spoil
you
etcetera
etcetera
may
not
be.
However
that
is
another
part
that
is
not
part
of
our
interest
at
this
moment,
but
our
interest
is
that
this
cholesterol
is
also
available
in
ppm
level
ok.
T ime
is
up,
let
us
stop
it
today .
Thank
you.
