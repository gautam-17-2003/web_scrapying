Milk
Pasteurization
In
the
previous
class,
we
have
said
how
the
whole
milk
is
being
processed.
So,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
in
lecture
number
41,
we
come
to
this
level
of
Milk
Pasteurization.
So,
milk
pasteurization
because
we
have
said
in
that
flowchart;
if
you
remember
that
after
the
milk
is
received
from
different
sources,
then
they
are
tested
and
after
testing,
if
they
are
found
ok.
Then
they
are
standardized,
and
after
standardization,
they
under go
pasteurization,
then
homogenization,
and
then
sealing,
and
then
it
goes
for
packaging.
And
we
have
dealt
this
packaging
and
other
parts
in
detail
earlier .
Now
you
come
to
individual
processes
right.
So,
before
you
go
to
standardization
let
us
first
look
into
pasteurization.
Milk
pasteurization
of
course,
this
we
have
said
earlier
also
that
the
pasteurization
word
came,
or
this
coin
came
from
the
name
of
the
one
of
the
famous
and
biggest
scientist
Louis
Pasteur ,
on
his
basis
on
his
development
on
his
discovery ,
this
was
given
him
the
honor ,
that
pasteurization
process
anything
which
is
under going
the
process
this
type
of
they
are
called
pasteurization
right.
So,
now,
let
us
look
into
what
is
that
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

1
So,
what
is
milk
pasteurization?
We
say
milk
pasteurization
is
the
process
of
milk
pasteurization
is
the
process
of
heating
milk,
or
milk
products
whatever
it
be
to
a
predetermined
temperature
for
a
specified
period
without
recontamination
during
the
entire
process.
So,
lots
of
things
have
been
said
right:
so
that
means,
a
predetermined
temperature
you
have
to
know
that
which
temperature
and
I
always
said
that
this
is
not
only
temperature,
but
also
the
time.
So,
any
heating
is
a
combination
of
time
temperature
right.
Similarly
cooling
is
also
time
temperature
heating,
or
cooling,
or
thermal
process
is
mixture,
or
is
a
product
of
both
heating
temperature
as
well
as
time,
cooling
temperature
as
well
as
time.
So,
there
the
predetermined
temperature
and
the
time
for
heating,
that
is
predetermined
provided
during
the
process,
you
do
not
inculcate
lot
of
other
contaminants,
or
contamination
that
is
a
must,
that
during
that
process
you
should
not
get
it
further
contaminated,
once
it
is
pasteurized
that
is
why
by
definition
it
is
said.
The
predetermined
temperature
usually
depends
on
the
heat
resistance
of
the
spoilage
microor ganism
that
the
pasteurization
program
is
targeting
to
destroy .
So,
depend
in
many
cases
depending
on
the
locality
depending
on
the
initial
contamination,
this
depending
on
the
nature
of
contaminants,
the
target
organisms
changes
right.
There
are
many
target
organisms
out
of
which
one
the
most
provide
is
Clostridium
botulinum
right.
So,
that
is
one
and
in
many
cases
Mycr obacter
tuber culosis
also
could
be,
but
that
is
also
not
that
much
is
heat
resistant,
but
this
one
botulinum
is
definitely
one,
where
this
is
taken
as
and
there
are
many
other
also
right.
So,
you
determined
pre
this
heat
determined
in
advance
that,
what
is
your
target
organism
which
should
be
destroyed
and
if
it
is
destroyed,
then
it
tells
that
all
other
pathogenic
organisms
are
destroyed
and
killed.
The
primary
objective
of
pasteurization
is
to
kill
the
pathogen.
That
is
the
primary
objective.
So,
that
after
drinking
milk
nobody
is
infected
with
any
disease
that
is
the
primary
ok.
Then
pasteurization
is
necessary
number
one,
there
is
a
public
health
concern.
Since
the
public
is
going
to
consume
the
product
pasteurization
kills
all
the
pathogenic
organisms,
or
bacteria
that
may
cause
infection
to
consumers.
So,
this
is
number
one
why
pasteurization
is
required,
that
it
will
since
the
milk
product,
or
milk
raw
milk,
or
liquid
milk
is
normally
consumed
all
over
the
world
by
all
over
the
world
lot
of
people.
So,
it
is
public
concern.
So,
if
it
is
a
public
concern,
then
after
consumption
they
should
not
fall
sick
that
is
the
primary
requirement
for
the
regulating
body
to
look
after,
that
any
food2product
like
this
milk,
if
consumed
by
consumer
they
should
not
fall
under
sick,
or
if
it
is
then
that
company
which
the
consumer
is
consuming
will
be
taken
to
the
court,
or
will
be
penalized
that
is
afterwards,
but
first
thing
they
should
not
be
in
any
way,
they
should
not
be
contaminated,
or
infected,
or
fall
sick
after
consuming
that
is
the
first
thing.
So,
that
is
what
why
pasteurization
is
primarily
required
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:08)
Then
the
other
reason
for
this
is
that,
there
is
no
need
to
ensure
that
the
product
can
keep
for
a
longer
period
without
expensive
storage
equipment.
Pasteurization
will
eliminate
spoilage
bacteria
and,
enzymes
and
extend
the
shelf
life
of
the
product.
So,
second
thing
this
is
one
side
which
the
controlling
body
has
looked
into
the
aspect
of
the
consumer ,
then
the
controlling
body
also
should
look
into
the
aspect
of
the
processor ,
because
if
after
processing,
if
it
needs
severe
storage
facility ,
severe
cost
involvement,
then
the
entire
process
may
not
be
commercially
viable/feasible.
So,
that
is
why
next
step
is
that
to
ensure,
that
the
product
can
keep
for
long
periods,
without
much
expensive
storage
equipment
right.
So,
you
should
kill
also
not
only
the
organisms,
which
are
causing
the
disease,
but
also
some
spoilage
organisms
that
also
should
not
be
they
are
eliminated.
So,
that
minimum
storage
facility
or
conditions
good
enough
to
keep
it
for
some
time
of
course,
it
is
cannot
be
claimed
that
a
pasteurized
milk
can
last
for
several
days
several
weeks,
several
months
like
that
right,
it
is
for
a
temporary
period
short
period,
where
your
extension
of
the
life
of
the
milk
is
given
or
extended
right.3
Then
the
amount
of
heat
and
length
of
time
used
in
pasteurization
depends
on
the
thermal
death
time
of
the
target
organisms,
another
thing
which
we
have
come
across
is
the
thermal
death
time
right.
So,
how
much
heat
you
need,
for
a
given
quantum
of
the
milk,
how
much
you
need
to
heat,
that
depends
on
the
thermal
death
time
right.
So,
thermal
death
time
of
the
target
microor ganisms,
the
you
have
already
targeted
to
what
microor ganism
you
want
to
make
the
sure
that
it
is
no
longer ,
there
after
pasteurization
and
for
that
you
are
supposed
to
look
into
the
thermal
death
time
of
that
organism.
That
will
dictate
that
will
tell
you
how
much
heat
has
to
be
supplied.
So,
you
have
to
then
look
into
the
how
much
energy,
you
have
to
spend
right.
The
minimum
combination
should
target,
the
most
resistant
pathogenic
organism
such
as
Coxiellae
burnettii
,
Coxiellae
burnettii
that
is
the
where
again
I
said
target
organisms
are
different
for
different
cases,
many
places
many
target
organisms
are
set.
And
this
depends
on
the
country
to
country ,
place
to
place
and
source
to
source;
source
from
where
it
is
being
collected,
all
these
factors
will
dictate
which
should
be
the
target
organism.
So,
we
said
one
is
Clostridium
botulinum
another
is
that
this
one
Coxiellae
burnettii
right.
So,
this
target
organism
can
be
killed
by
the
pasteurization
process.
So,
you
must
know
the
thermal
death
time
of
this
organism
that
it
Coxiellae
burnettii
ok.
Then
when
deriving
the
thermal
death
time
of
any
microor ganism,
the
temperature
must
remain
constant
and,
holding
time
is
varied
to
kill
the
specified
number
of
cells.
So,
lot
many
words
again
we
have
said,
specified
number
of
cells
right.
So,
initially
you
started
with
a
number
of
cells
of
say
10
10
,
right
that
was
your
initial
concentration.
Now ,
you
want
to
make
it
to
10
3
right.
So,
a
7
times
/
7
log
reduction
you
want
to
undertake.
So,
in
that
case
you
are
finding
out
before
hand,
what
is
the
thermal
death
time
of
that
particular
target
organism
and,
then
if
you
know
then
you
fix
up
the
temperature,
at
this
temperature
for
such
time
you
will
be
heating.
So,
that
will
tell
you
how
much
energy
is
required
right.
So,
energy
requirement
here
it
is
nothing,
but
‘mc
p
Δ
t’
because
there
is
no
phase
change
nothing.
So,
that
it
is
a
sensible
heat
right.
From
this
temperature
to
that
temperature
for
such
a
long
time,
you
want
to
heat
and
then
maintain
at
that
temperature.
So,
you
know
how
much
you
have
to
supply
heat
or
energy.
So,
that
is
determined
by
the
thermal
death
time
combination
and,
you
must
get
first
the
thermal
death
time
of
the
organism
right.4(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:25)
So,
we
come
to
the
new
word
thermal
death
time.
So,
thermal
death
time
or
D
value
is
the
duration
it
takes
to
kill,
a
certain
bacteria
at
a
given
temperature
right.
So,
thermal
death
time
normally
it
is
denoted
by
the
term
D
value
right.
So,
that
is
nothing
but
the
duration
it
takes
to
kill
a
certain
bacteria
at
a
given
temperature
right.
So,
the
time
required
to
kill
a
organism
at
the
given
temperature
is
the
D
value
right.
So,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
D
value
and
another
value,
which
is
z
value
or
F
value
right,
you
might
have
heard
these
D
value
z
value
F
value
what
are
they
and
what
is
their
difference
right.
Automatically
it
comes
to
the
mind,
then
the
decimal
reduction
time
that
is
the
D
value,
that
is
called
decimal
reduction
time
is
the
amount
of
time,
under
specified
conditions
to
reduce
microbial
population
by
one
decimal
that
is
1
log
cycle
right.
5
(Refer
Slide
Time:
15:12)
Log10
is
equals
to
1.
So,
if
you
want
to
make
it
one
log
cycle
difference,
then
you
have
to
so.
The
decimal
reduction
time
is
that
is
the
D
value,
is
the
amount
of
time
under
specified
conditions
to
reduce
microbial
population
by
one
decimal
right.
So,
this
is
one
decimal
we
are
reducing
right,
time
this
time
varies
and
is
dependent
on
the
temperature
and
the
target
microor ganisms,
what
is
the
target
microor ganism
that
will
dictate,
what
is
the
temperature
and
how
much
time
it
will
require.
So,
these
varies
on
the
organism
selected,
one
decimal
reduction
or
one
D
is
equivalent
to
a
population
drop
by
one
log
cycle
or
90%
reduction
right.
So,
one
log
cycle
reduction
means
90%
reduction
survivality
is
only
10%
right.
So,
automatically .
6
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:11)
If
1D
is
equals
to
90%
reduction,
then
what
is
the
reduction
in
percentage
if
it
is
2D,
then
it
becomes
99%.
If
it
is
3
D,
then
it
becomes
99.9%,
if
it
is
4D,
then
it
becomes
99.99%
and
so,
on
right.
So,
if
1D
corresponds
to
90%
reduction,
then
2D
corresponds
to
99%
reduction
3D
corresponds
to
99.9%
reduction
4D
corresponds
to
99.9%
reduction.
Now ,
here
one
thing
you
should
keep
in
mind,
mathematically
the
number
is
so,
close
that
99.9
purity
if
it
is
there,
then
that
0.1%
right,
0.1%
means
one
in
1%
means
1
in
100.
So,
0.1%
means
1
in
1000
right
so;
that
means,
in
out
of
1000
sales,
if
1
is
surviving
that
1
is
good
enough
to
further
again
multiply
right.
So,
if
that
is
why
mathematically
it
appears
that
99.9%
is
killed.
So,
we
have
achieved
it
is
not.
Because
that
0.1%
that
is
1
in
1000
is
good
enough.
So,
if
out
of
1000
people
consuming
1%
will
be
affected
statistically
right.
So,
that
is
not
desirable.
So,
you
should
not
take
that
chance,
that
it
is
1
out
of
1000
you
will
be
infected
no
your
target
should
be
as
much
maybe
1000000
people
out
of
1000000
lakhs
people
1
percent
can
be
affected,
or
out
of
1crore
1
percent
could
be
affected.
So,
your
target
should
be
like
that.
So,
that
will
be
dictated
how
many
Ds
you
will
be
bringing,
or
how
many
Ds
you
will
perform
right.
So,
that
is
why
the
D
value
is
so,
much
D
value
is
so
much
important
that
to
know
the
thermal
death
time
these
the
decimal
reduction
time
is
very
much
important
right.
7
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:20)
Next
we
see
that
for
example,
if
the
population
of
microbe,
if
the
population
of
microbe
is
microbe
X
right,
we
have
taken
no
name.
If
the
population
of
microbe
X
is
reduced
to
10
percent
by
exposing
it
to
101
degree
centigrade
for
4
seconds,
if
it
is
like
that
we
denote
the
D
value
of
the
microbe
x
as
D
121
,
this
121
corresponds
to
the
temperature
at
which
you
are
subjecting
is
equal
to
4
seconds.
So,
the
time
required
is
4
second
at
121°C
right.
So,
D
121
is
4
seconds
that
is
the
thermal
death
time
is
4
seconds
corresponding
to
121°C
that
is
why
you
have
mentioned
the
suffix
121
right.
So,
for
spore
formers
it
could
be
more
because
spore
formers
is
now,
again
this
is
out
of
the
way
that
vegetative
cells
are
those
which
multiply
under
normal
condition
vary
and,
which
can
be
killed
also
with
the
minimum
effort.
But
spore
formers
the
other
day
I
said
perhaps
that,
that
like
that
like
that
coating
is
being
formed
by
some
of
the
insects.
So,
they
make
a
covering
out
of
it.
So,
that
protects
it
from
the
surrounding
under
unfavorable
condition
also
it
survives,
snail
is
one
such
right.
So,
these
organisms
also
there
are
certain,
which
who
are
spore
formers,
they
do
for
one
coating
around
it.
And
this
coating
is
so,
much
that
it
is
very
much
heat
resistant
and
in
unlike
vegetative
cells,
which
can
be
killed
with
some
energy,
they
need
much
more
energy
than
that
of
the
vegetative
cell.
So,
spore
formers
if
they
are
at
all
present.
So,
you
have
to
be
doubly
cautious,
doubly
careful
about
the
killing
of
the
spore
former .
8
So,
for
spore
formers
like,
Clostridium
botulinum
which
is
a
spore
former
the
treatment
should
be
achieved
by
the
treatment
should
be
achieved
by
so,
here
you
write
D
and
here
achieved,
or
treatment
should
achieve
ok,
should
achieve
12
D
12
log
cycle
reduction
in
original
bacterial
population
right,
12
log
cycle
reduction.
So,
1
D
if
you
remember
we
said
90
percent
2
D
you
remember ,
we
said
99%,
then
3
D
we
said
99.9%
right;
so
with
one
decimal
2
D
right.
So,
then
12
log
cycle
12D
will
be
how
much.
So,
that
killing
will
be
99.9999999999.
So,
these
many
right.
So,
1
out
of
that
you
may
survive.
So,
that
survivability
is
chance
is
very
poor.
So,
you
are
taking
the
trace
of
course,
you
cannot
by
decimal
reduction
you
cannot
come
to
0.
You
never
can
come
to
0
mathematically
you
cannot
come
to
0
right
nothing
is
equal
to
0
for
that
in
the
decimal.
So,
in
the
log
cycle,
then
if
you
are
not
able
to
come
to
0,
then
you
must
come
as
close.
Now ,
that
close
is
as
I
said
yes
1
out
of
10
10
,
1
out
of
10
8
.
So,
that
is
why
12
log
cycle
is
required
that
is
12D
is
performed
for
these
spore
former
like
Clostridium
botulinum
right.
So,
this
is
how
z
value
D
value
we
are
defining.
So,
then
other
that
is
the
z
value
is
a
measure
of
the
change
in
the
rate
of
death
due
to
change
in
temperature,
z
value
is
the
measure
of
change
in
the
rate
of
death
due
to
change
in
temperature.
It
is
the
change
in
temperature
required,
to
change
the
decimal
death
time
right
one
log
cycle,
or
one
decimal
1
D.
So,
to
bring
down
1
D
what
is
the
temperature
required,
that
will
tell
us
the
z
value
right
to
bring
down
1
D
right,
that
1
D
log
cycle,
or
1
D
number
to
reduce
the
number
by
1D/
one
log
cycle
what
is
the
temperature
requirement
or
change
in
temperature
requirement
that
is
the
that
is
the
z
value
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:04)
9So,
if
that
be
the
z
value
then
in
order
so,
in
other
words
we
can
say
that
in
other
words
we
can
say
z
value
is
the
measure
of
bacterial
sensitivity
to
heat
treatment,
it
is
the
change
in
temperature
that
will
reduce,
the
D
value
by
a
factor
of
10,
a
z
value
can
be
obtained
by
plotting
two
D
values
against
temperature
right.
So,
by
plotting
two
D
values
against
temperature,
you
can
find
out
the
z
value.
So,
another
thing
value
which
we
said
F
value,
F
value
is
the
duration
it
will
take
to
kill
a
non-bacterial
population.
So,
non-bacterial
population
means,
you
know
initially
sorry ,
you
know
initially
you
have
10
to
the
power
6
number
of
organisms
right.
Now ,
you
want
to
bring
that
to
10.
So,
known
that
10
to
the
power
6
that
is
what
we
are
saying,
if
the
duration
it
will
take
to
kill
a
known
bacterial
population
right,
it
is
the
F
value
the
duration,
it
will
take
to
kill
a
known
bacterial
population
is
the
F
value.
It
is
usually
set
at
12
log
cycle,
or
12
D
to
kill
the
most
resistant
micro
most
resistant
mesophilic
spore
in
a
food
sample
right.
So,
again
another
new
word
mesophilic
has
come
in.
So,
in
this
respect
let
me
also
tell,
that
there
are
3
types
of
bacterial
population,
one
is
psychrophilic,
then
mesophilic
and
then
thermophilic,
psychrophilic
they
love
low
temperature
to
survive
to
multiply
mesophilic,
they
love
moderate
temperature,
to
survive
and
multiply
and
act
whatever
actions,
they
have
and
thermophilic
they
love
high
temperature,
or
relatively
high
temperature
around
45-50
say
55°C
that
temperature
range,
they
do
love
and
multiply
at
that
high
temperature
right.
10
So,
the
depending
on
which
organism,
you
are
targeting
your
F
value
z
value
and
D
values
are
also
dependent.
So,
different
microor ganisms
have
different
D
values;
however ,
the
D
values
follow
a
negative
slope,
when
plotted
on
a
graph
right.
So,
we
will
come
to
that
next
time
because
today
our
time
is
over.
So,
next
time
we
will
do
on
TDT
that
is
thermal
death
time
ok.
We
will
try
to
plot
also
and
see.
Thank
you.
