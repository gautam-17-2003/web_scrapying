Food
Additives
If
you
look
at
your
outline,
which
we
are
given
in
the
beginning
of
course
we
are
given
a
tentative
out
line,
it
is
not
that
always
that
outline
can
be
adhered
to
with
the
classes
or
time
frame.
The
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
this
is
very,
very
difficult
that
which
one
will
be
more
useful
for
you,
or
which
one
will
be
less
useful
to
you
to
identify
them,
right.
Not
only
that,
in
many
cases
this
may
be
prerequisite
for
your
next
class
or
some
other
classes
may
be
either
your
some
descriptive
like
this
one
or
some
engineering
classes.
This
may
act
as
a
pre
requisite
this
idea
this
knowledge
may
help
you;
that
is
why
as
and
when
we
will
be
coming
across,
we
from
our
my
experience
that
this
part
may
be
more
useful
to
the
students,
then
maybe
in
the
second
week
which
we
had
given
laws
they
are
absolutely
what
we
can
termed
as
dry.
Because
laws
yeah
there
are
many ,
but
it
is
less
to
be
highlighted
or
highlighted.
I
do
not
say
that
they
are
having
less
importance
it
is
equally
important,
but
this
is
the
our
more
dry
in
the
sense
not
so
much
to
understand,
but
more
to
remember
memorize.
So,
that
will
go
very,
very
quickly
rather
than
explaining
like
this,
what
we
are
doing
even
in
the
first
week
what
you
are
supposed
to
which
we
have
not.
So,
today
we
are
coming
to
another
important
one.
So,
let
us
see
which
one
is
that
this
is
our
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology
so,
it
remains
same.
So,
let
us
go
into
in
todayâ€™ s
some
topic
;
that
is,
additives
right,
this
was
on
the
first
week
yes,
this
is
important
which
will
tell
as
additive,
which
will
tell
as
preservative
etcetera
.
1(Refer
Slide
Time:
02:55)
So,
additives
we
can
define
that
substance,
those
are
added
to
products
to
perform
specific
technological
functions
such
as
say
it
may
act
as
a
preservative,
or
it
may
act
as
inhibitor
to
the
growth
of
organisms
or
pathogens,
or
it
may
act
as
coloring
material,
or
it
may
add
a
flavor
to
the
material.
So,
depending
on
what
you
are
using
where
so,
you
can
then
additive
is
the
big
umbrella,
right.
So,
depending
on
what
you
want
accordingly
this
may
be
termed
as
a
preservative,
if
you
want
to,
if
you
have
seen
mummies
doing
something
at
home
at,
and
sometimes
it
is
adding
something
for
keeping
it
for
a
longer
time
so,
then
it
can
be
termed
as
a
preservative,
right.
In
some
cases,
you
will
also
have
seen
that
some
things
are
added
for
the
betterment
of
the
appearance
in
terms
of
color
or
maybe
some
odour
which
is
liked
by
you
or
flavor
that
is
being
added.
So,
depending
on
what
is
your
requirement,
what
is
your
goal,
what
do
you
want
to
do
accordingly
the
thing
the
substance
which
is
added
can
be
termed
as
additive.
So,
additive
we
can
define
as
a
substance
that
is
added
to
either
extend
the
life
or
to
improve
the
color ,
or
to
impose
some
flavour
or
order
to
impart
some
flavor
or
order
to
the
specific
food,
or
maybe
to
inactivate
some
enzymatic
reactions.
So,
those
or
to
2
maybe
keep
away
the
pathogenic
organisms
from
the
food
material;
so,
those
substances
may
be
called
as
the
additive,
right.
Now ,
justification
is
why
should
we
do,
that
this
maintains
the
nutritional
quality
of
the
food
material,
and
this
enhances
the
stability
reducing
wastage
makes
food
attractive
to
consumer ,
in
a
manner
that
that
precludes
deception
provides
essential
aids
to
food
processing,
right?.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:00)
So,
types
of
additives
then
how
many
types
there,
that
can
be
natural,
can
be
artificial
or
can
be
manmade,
right.
So,
natural
which
is
available
in
the
in
nature,
in
many
many
in
many
many
cases,
many
food
materials
do
have
this
additives
by
it
is
nature,
or
you
can
extract
you
can
utilize
them
as
a
natural
resource,
right?
In
some
cases,
maybe
you
have
made
it
by
you
and
then
added.
And
in
some
cases,
it
might
have
been
synthetically
obtained
and
you
might
be
adding
them.
So,
depending
on
that
what
is
the
source.
So,
we
can
divide
them
into
three
types,
one
is
natural
which
are
found
naturally ,
and
such
as
extracts
beetroot
that
can
be
used
as
a
coloring
agent.
This
is
an
example
or
manmade
additives.
So,
it
is
manmade
additives
are
chemicals,
or
it
can
be
chemicals
or
synthetic
directly ,
it
can
be
or
it
can
be
synthesized
substances
may
be
found
naturally
such
as
benzoic
acids,
3
it
has
a
name
E210,
right;
or
used
as
preservatives;
that
is,
or
artificial
that
is
synthetically
produced
or
naturally
are
not
available.
This
is
not
naturally
available,
they
are
synthetically
produced.
So,
they
can
be
called
as
artificial,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:16)
Now ,
food
additives
as
a
whole
we
can
say
that
food
additives
are
any
substitute
or
any
substance,
that
becomes
part
of
a
food
product
either
directly
or
indirectly
during
processing
storing
or
packaging.
So,
this
in
one
umbrella,
we
can
say
that
food
additives
are
substance
or
substitute
that
becomes
part
of
a
food
product
either
directly
or
indirectly
during
the
processing
or
storage
or
packaging,
right?
Now ,
some
terms
which
we
come
across
called
GRAS;
that
is
generally
recognized
as
safe.
4
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:00)
This
comes
under
the
purview
of
dis
additive.
So,
there
are
some
substances
which
are
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
that
can
be
safely
utilized
or
added.
This
was
first
established
in
700
places
on
the
list
of
without
going
through
testing,
right.
So,
if
those
list
is
your
item
it
falls
under
those
list,
generally
recognized
as
safe,
then
you
can
directly
add
it
without
testing,
right.
Now ,
those
substances
are
being
re-evaluated
of
course,
because
this
is
what
is
science,
what
was
not
known
yesterday
is
known
today
or
may
be
knowing
tomorrow;
So,
depending
on
the
availability
of
the
information.
So,
this
list
may
go
on
changing
adding
or
deleting,
the
reason
being
some
which
were
found
long
back
was
very
good,
but
nowadays
it
might
have
been
seen,
that
it
has
some
other
effect
which
are
not
desirable.
So,
non-desirable
effects
so,
for
that
that
typical
things
might
be
typical
chemicals,
might
be
either
unlisted
or
enlisted.
So,
depending
on
the
use
and
if
it
is
again
coming
on
the
in
the
list
of
the
generally
recognized
as
safe,
list
then
you
can
as
when
we
come
to
the
law
in
some
time.
So,
that
time
you
will
see,
that
you
can
directly
use
without
going
for
any
bindings
like
that,
ok.
So,
after
generally
recognized
as
safe,
let
us
look
into
what
is
required
to
become
a
food
additive,
what
are
the
requirements.
5
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:15)
So,
we
see
that
these
six
things
which
we
can
say
safely ,
that
the
minimum
requirement
to
for
any
substance
to
become
additive
to
the
food
is
it
should
provide
additive
is
effective
what
do
you
are
adding
must
be
effective,
other
is
what
is
the
purpose
why
should
you
add
it,
right.
So,
it
must
be
effective
so,
that
is
one
requirement
for
to
become
additive,
I
should
prove
to
be
add
it
additive
that
can
be
detected
and
measured
in
final
products.
So,
we
should
be
able
to
detect
whatever
we
have
added
in
even
in
the
final
product,
such
that
it
is
not
making
some
chemical
or
some
binding
reactions
so,
that
it
is
it
cannot
be
identified.
So,
that
should
not
be
so,
it
is
another
requisition,
that
it
should
be
having
some
way
or
other
it
should
be
measurable
in
the
product
also.
Then
to
the
study
the
effects
of
the
substance
on
animals
in
large
doses,
whenever
any
additives
are
being
added,
right
I
tell
it
of
the
cup,
but
please
do
not
take
it
in
that,
because
not
yet
established.
Some
of
our
students
are
working
on
it,
that
some
plant
origin
materials
are
being
also
added
to
say
product
like
to
increase
the
life
as
well
as
self-life,
as
well
as
the
for
the
nowadays
in
diabetes
has
become
very
much,
I
mean
in
a
bad
shape,
and
it
is
going
up
the
people
who
are
suffering
from
that.
So,
to
cater
those
kinds
of
people,
some
chemist
some
plant
origin
materials,
for
students
our
students
are
rather
my
students
are
working.
And
there
it
maybe
I
this
things
are
6
applicable,
this
things
can
be
said
that
if
it
is
not
effective,
if
it
cannot
be
identified
even
in
the
product
at
the
product
stage,
or
things
like
that
we
cannot
call
that
to
be
additive.
As
well
those
should
be
also
seen
with
the
help
of
some
animal
tests,
right.
So,
here
doing
with
the
dual
test
like
your
test
with
mice
and
a
rats
and
others,
such
that
what
is
the
effect
on
that,
then
only
it
will
be
looked
into
the
mankind
how
whether
it
is
having
really
any
harmful,
or
any
better
effect
or
not.
Then
submit
results
to
validate
the
findings,
and
schedule
a
public
hearing
and
either
federal
department
of
adulterations
different
agent
I
should
say
different
agencies
depending
on
the
nation,
different
agencies
may
approve
or
reject
to
become
a
food
additive.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
15:16)
Then
functions
of
the
food
additives
what
it
does,
food
additives
it
acts
as
a
preservatives
number
1.
Now ,
to
keep
the
food
material
fresh
and
reduce
the
spoilage,
this
can
be
added.
And
this
can
control
the
bacteria
and
mold
fungi
and
yeast
any
such
things
that
can
be
controlled
by
resistance.
Activity
of
those
microor ganisms
that
can
be
done,
and
in
this
case,
we
add
many
such
preservatives
as
it
is
the.
So,
the
first
function
of
the
additive
is
as
to
act
as
a
preservative.
7
Example
benzoate
in
many
cases
benzoates
are
added
right,
or
BHT
that
is
Butylated
hydroxytoluene
and
Butylated
hydroxylanisole
right.
So,
in
that
case,
this
is
called
as
the
antioxidant
or
calcium
propionate
that
inhibits
molds.
So,
this
can
be
additives
or
preservatives,
and
then
sodium
bisulfate
or
meta
bisulfite.
In
many
cases,
they
are
also
used
as
the
preservative,
right?
May
be
in
jam,
jelly
or
marmalade
when
you
make
at
home,
mean
by
may
adding
this
type
of
preservatives,
either
sodium
benzoate
or
may
by
meta
bisulfite.
They
are
whatever
is
available
it
is
added,
sodium
nitrate
in
some
previous
class
we
had
also
told
that
yes
it
acts
as
a
preservative,
right,
then
other
things
then
processing
aids.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:26)
Processing
aid
it
may
help
in
the
processing
to
improve
the
consistency
to
add
the
stability
or
to
aid
oil
and
water
mixtures
and
retain
moisture.
Any
of
these,
it
can
be
right
so,
the
purpose
is
to
improve
the
consistency
of
the
of
the
not
only
product
consistency
of
the
processing
unit
so,
that
your
desirable
things
are
achieved,
right.
It
adds
the
stability ,
and
aid
oil
and
water
mixtures,
and
also
it
can
retain
the
moisture
of
the
product,
right,
for
any
such
we
can
call
to
it
to
be
the
processing
aid,
right,
the
additive
which
are
being
used.
8
For
example,
see
in
many
cases
gums
are
used
that
can
be
alginate,
or
the
carrageenan
or
xanthan.
So,
this
is
algin
or
may
be
that
product
is
algin,
but
the
chemical
could
be
alginate,
right.
In
some
cases,
it
could
be
aluminum,
calcium
silicate,
they
also
help
to
improve
the
stability ,
right
or
consistency .
In
some
benzoyol
peroxide
there
also
added.
So,
these
are
aided,
either
to
increase
the
stability
or
the
consistency
or
a
good
behavior
of
oil
in
and
water
mixture.
And
oil
water
mixtures
we
will
come
across
very
well,
when
we
see
that
milk
when
will
be
dealing
with
directly .
(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:35)
That
time
you
will
see
that
this
oil
water
mixture
is
primarily
affected,
because
oil
and
water
they
are
not
miscible,
right
that
we
know
very
well.
That
water
and
oil
they
are
not
miscible.
So,
if
they
are
not
miscible,
then
how
to
bring
them
close,
how
to
keep
them
together .
So,
for
that
an
intermediate
or
friend
of
both
right
a
friend
of
both
either
water
and
the
oil
is
added
or
is
maybe
naturally
there.
So,
that
acts
as
the
additive
right
so,
that
may
be
added
ok.
So,
the
third
function
is
that
to
act
as
the
nutrient,
right
to
act
as
a
nutrient
which
maintain
or
improve
the
nutritional
quality
of
the
food,
for
example,
alpha
tocopherol,
ascorbic
acid,
biotin,
beta
carotene,
calcium
pantothenate
or
folic
acids,
these
are
added
as
nutrients
in
many
products,
right.
These
are
some
example,
this
is
does
not
mean
beyond
this
is
not
list
is
not
there,
right.
9
These
are
some
examples
of
different
types
like
alpha
tocopherol,
tocopherol.
We
know
this
is
an
anti-oxidant,
right,
ascorbic
acid
that
is
also
in
many
cases
added
in
such
that
in
the
during
the
process;
if
the
ascorbic
acid
content
is
minimized,
then
that
process
maybe
in
cases
termed
that
not
so
suitable,
because
ascorbic
acid
is
also
one
very
heat
sensitive
product.
So,
your
processing
might
not
have
been
tolerating
such
conditions
which
you
are
preventing
right.
So,
next
is
folic
acid
or
calcium
pantothenate.
So,
beta
carotene,
biotin,
they
are
all
added
as
the
addition
so
that
the
nutritive
value
can
be
increased,
right.
So,
the
4th
function
of
the
additive
can
be
that
it
can
be
act
as
flavor
aiding
or
favor
improving
material,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:24)
So,
as
a
flavor
improving
material
in
that
the
complement
is
that,
it
may
add
to
be
flavor
right,
and
if
I.
I
remember
normally
we
are
happy
with
any
and
every
kind
of
ice
cream,
right
during
my
stay
at
in
ice
cream
industry .
I
saw
that
there
they
had
added
some
flavor ,
like
pan
I
hope
you
betel
leaf
if
you
know .
So,
right
after
the
end
of
the
any
party
or
any
such
huge
feast,
if
you
will
do
take
pan
as
the
end
product
at
the
as
the
end
of
the
end
of
the
food.
10
So,
there
this
flavor
pan
who
was
added
to
the
ice
cream
such
that
the
both
ice
cream
and
ice
cream
you
are
getting
the
on
pleasure
of
taking
it,
as
well
the
you
are
taking
getting
the
pressure
of
taking
the
pan,
because
that
flavor
was
added
in
it
like
these
are
some
typical
examples,
ok.
So,
to
complement
magnify
or
modify
the
test
or
aroma
of
the
food
this
may
be
flavor
aiding
or
flavor
enhancing
agent,
right.
For
example,
aspartame
corn
syrup,
ethyl
vanillin,
mannitol,
monosodium,
glutamate
of
course,
MSG
monosodium
glutamate
this
was
also
taken
as
the
flavoring
material.
But
nowadays,
as
I
said
in
some
earlier
class
that
or
today
I
said
that
sometime
that
in
the
list
things
are
getting
added
or
getting
deleted
depending
on
time
and
again,
it
is
being
by
the
respective
this
organization,
it
is
functions
are
being
evaluated
and
if
they
are
found
that
not
so
suitable,
then
or
some
bad
effects
are
there,
then
they
are
withdrawn
or
if
it
is
found
to
be
very
good
then
they
are
being
added.
So,
one
such
example
is
that
mono
sodium
glutamate
or
MSG
known
normally .
So,
it
is
normally
nowadays
people
are
trying
to
avoid
because
of
these
not
so
good
cause.
So,
good
effect
on
I
am
not
saying
effect
on
the
food
it
is
ok,
but
post
affect
on
the
human
being
may
not
be
that
much
good.
So,
it
is
not
being
utilized
nowadays
monosodium
glutamate,
but
they
are
all
flavor
enhancer
or
flavor
enhancing
material
so,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:53)
11
Then
colors;
in
many
cases
that
as
we
said
colors
are
added.
So,
for
example,
to
give
foods
are
desired
appetizing
or
characteristic
color
they
are
added,
right.
May
be
not
so
good
in
taste,
but
it
is
color
is
so
appealing
that
the
product
is
being
sold,
right.
Because
they
are
so
appealing
so
that
is
why
color
is
our
appearance,
color
is
in
other
words
primarily
associated
with
the
appearance.
So,
a
color
is
attractive,
then
the
product
first
is
chosen,
and
then
they
find
whether
it
is
good
or
bad.
So,
for
from
the
consumer
point
of
view ,
consumer
level
this
color
has
to
be
attractive
or
colors
is
having
a
primary
effect
on
the
selection.
Some
colors
are
added
like
caramel
Beta-apo-8-Carotenal,
which
is
orange
in
color
caramel
color
we
just
said
many
times;
Citrus
red,
FD
and
C
blue
number
1,
FD
and
C
red
number
3,
FD
and
C
yellow
number
5.
These
are
some
coloring
materials,
right.
Some
common
some
common
preservatives
to
which
are
to
active
are
that
can
we
seen
that,
chemicals
right
how
they
are
effective.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:26)
Some
chemicals
for
example,
chemicals
sulfites,
right
in
a
way
it
is
applicable
in
insects
and
microor ganisms,
action
is
as
antioxidant
and
used
in
dried
fruits
and
wines.
For
like
that
many
such
chemicals
which
are
getting
affected,
we
are
listing
here
sodium
nitrate
propionic
acid,
sorbic
acid,
benzoic
acid,
etcetera.
12
Then
clostridia
mold,
yeasts
and
molds,
organisms
where
it
is
being
active,
or
the
function
is
that
anti-microbial,
here
it
was
anti-oxidant,
right.
In
cured
meats
or
bread
and
cakes,
cheese
cheesecake
salads
etcetera.
So,
addressing
soft
drinks
or
some
addressing
ketchup,
all
this
they
may
be
applicable
they
may
being
used,
right.
So,
this
is
in
one
now
product
quality .
I
think,
this
is
an
another
one
which
we
need
a
longer
time.
So,
today
it
being
very
small,
almost
we
are
on
the
verge
of
the
end
of
the
class.
So,
I
think
we
should
talk
about
in
the
next
class,
but
I
repeat
that
we
had
given
you
the
framework
or
the
syllabus.
It
is
not
likely
all
the
time
we
will
adhere,
week
by
week
the
same
topic
depending
on
I
the
our
experience
or
my
experience
with
the
students,
how
much
they
like
and
which
is
more
important
or
less
important;
depending
on
that
we
will
highlight
somewhere
more
somewhere
less,
ok.
Thank
you.
