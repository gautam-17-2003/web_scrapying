Milk
-
What
is
it
So,
we
have
seen
that
the
mammalian
secretion
is
the
milk
right.
So,
we
come
to
again
back
to
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology
right.
T oday
is
the
lecture
17
and
we
will
discuss
more
and
more
about
milk
right.
There
is
the
dairy
product
we
have
said
what
is
the
reason
why
mammalians
or
why
the
product
milk
is
so
dif ferent
in
dif ferent
process
of
sources
right.
Now
if
we
you
need
to
know
some
of
the
terms,
terminology
is
also
you
need
to
know;
for
example,
milk
fraction
terms
we
can
know
that
we
have
heard
plasma
right.
So,
plasma
is
milk
other
than
fat
or
we
can
call
it
to
be
skim
milk.
Skim
milk
is
considered
to
be
plasma
that
is
milk
other
than
fat,
milk
minus
fat.
That’ s
what
we
have
given
as
the
definition
right.
Milk
other
then
fat
is
the
plasma
or
skim
milk,
then
serum.
Serum
is
plasma
minus
casein
micelle
right.
So,
plasma
is
milk
minus
fat
right.
Now ,
plasma,
milk
minus
fat;
serum,
plasma
minus
casein
right,
so
you
have
removed
two
nutrients;
one
is
fat
and
another
is
protein.
So,
plasma
minus
protein
or
casein
or
casein
micelles
is
our
whey
that
is
what
is
we
get.
So,
that
is
the
serum.
Serum
is
the
whey ,
whey
is
serum.
So,
that
definition
that
naming
we
have
to
keep
in
mind.
Then
Solid
Not
Fat
or
S
N
F
normally ,
we
call
it
to
be
S
N
F .
So,
solid
not
fats
are
definitely
other
than
fat
whatever
else
is
present
is
the
Solid
Not
Fat.
So,
what
those
are?
It
could
be
protein,
it
could
be
lactose,
it
could
be
minerals,
it
could
be
acids,
it
could
be
enzymes,
it
could
be
vitamins.
So,
either
singly
or
as
a
whole
all
of
them
right,
depending
on
where,
how
much,
which
is
there,
so
depending
on
that
other
than
fat,
rest
of
the
things
are
solid
not
fat
right;
definitely
moisture
also
does
not
come
into
it
right
because
that
is
not
solid.
So,
solid
not
fat
is
other
than
fat,
rest
of
the
things
like
protein,
carbohydrate,
vitamins,
and
minerals,
everything
that
comes
into
solid
not
fat
right,
all
including
enzymes,
vitamins,
etcetera.
It
is
the
total
solid
contents;
it
is
the
total
solid
contents
minus
the
fat
content
right.
If
you
find
out
T
S,
total
solid.
So,
that
total
solid
minus
the
fat
content
is
the
solid
not
fat.
So,
we
can
say
total
milk
solid
is
fat
plus
S
N
F
right,
total
milk
solid
is
fat
plus
solid
not
fat
is
the
total
milk
solid.
This
definition
we
should
keep
in
mind,
I
repeat
first
you
said
plasma,
plasma
is
the
milk
minus
fat
that
is
skim
milk
is
plasma
that
milk
minus
fat
is
plasma
and
that
is
skim
milk
but
when
you
come
to
skim
milk
you
will
see,
the
skim
milk
is
not
absolutely
free
from
fat
but
here
it
is
free
from
fat.
So,
it
could
be
said,
this
is
rough.
This
could
be
said
roughly
equal
to
right.
This
could
be
said
roughly
equal
to
skim
milk
right
because
skim
milk
also
do
contain
a
very
small
quantity
of
fat
right
but
plasma
does
means
milk
minus
fat
that
is
the
roughly
skim
milk.
Then
we
said
serum,
milk
serum
is
plasma
minus
the
casein
or
protein;
casein
or
protein
which
we
tell
to
be
equivalent
to
whey
because
we
have
removed
fat,
we
have
removed
protein
right
and
then
the
remaining
is
whey
that
is
water
and
all
water
soluble
things
in
that
is
what
is
the
whey
right.
Then
we
said
another
term
called
solid
not
fat
or
S
N
F
that
is
or
many
many
times
it
is
also
said
M
S
N
F
right
oh.
In
many
times,
it
is
also
said
M
S
N
F
that
is
M
S
N
F
right
or
milk
solid
not
fat,
only
solid
not
fat
S
N
F
or
M
S
N
F
milk
solid
not
fat
right.
So
that
means,
other
than
fat,
rest
of
these
solids
present
in
milk
is
the
milk
solid
not
fat
or
S
N
F
right.
It
constitutes
of
lactose,
proteins,
minerals,
vitamins,
enzymes,
a
all
inclusive
right
either
singly
if
it
is
or
in
combination
as
and
when
it
is
right.
So,
all
put
together
is
solid
not
fat
other
than
fat
right.
So
that
means,
in
milk
total
solid
is
equal
to
solid
not
fat
plus
fat
in
milk
right.
So,
these
definition
we
will
keep
in
mind
as
and
when
if
requires
will
in
case,
we
will
come
back
to
that
right.
So,
when
casein
molecules
are
ok.When
casein
molecules
are
manufactured
by
a
mammalian,
they
are
manufactured
in
water
that
is
cow
milk
which
contains
around
88
percent
water .
As
the
casein
molecules
are
formed,
they
begin
to
folding
up
into
a
spherical
micelle.
This
term
micelle
again
is
one
which
is
required
to
be
understood
right.
So,
casein
micelle
that
is
the
structure
so
that
the
casein
proteins
can
remain
suspended
indefinitely
in
water
right.
It
is
subsequently
when
will
progress
accordingly
we
will
come
across
that
milk
is
such
a
unique
thing
where
all
3
phases
right,
this
is
not
the
phase
diagram
phase,
all
3
phases
like
solution,
then
colloid,
then
emulsion,
all
3
phases
are
there
in
milk
right.
Some
are
in
solution,
some
are
in
colloid
phase,
some
are
in
emulsion
phase.
So,
this
is
what
we
are
saying
that
casein
micelle
is
such
when
casein
is
formed,
it
is
in
so
beautiful
way
nature
has
made
it
that
it
does
not
come
out
that
just
like
that
because
casein
is
not
soluble
in
water
but
in
water
it
is
remaining
as
suspended
as
in
the
colloidal
form
and
that
is
we
call
casein
micelle
right.
What
is
a
micelle?
Micelle
is
an
aggregated
or
aggregation
of
molecules
in
a
colloidal
solution
right.
Aggregate
or
aggregation
of
molecules
in
a
colloidal
solution,
this
is
that
micelle
is
an
aggregation
or
aggregate
of
molecules
in
a
colloidal
solution.
An
electrically
char ged
particle
formed
by
an
aggregate
of
molecules
and
occurring
in
certain
colloidal
electrolyte
solution
right
and
you
might
have
heard
that
casein
is
the
slightly
char ged
particle
right
and
this
is
what
we
are
saying
here
also
that
the
casein
micelle
is
an
electrically
char ged
particle
formed
by
an
aggregate
of
molecules
and
occurring
in
certain
colloidal
electrolyte
solutions.
So,
by
I
U
P
A
C
definition,
I
hope
we
have
not
for gotten
the
full
form
of
I
U
P
A
C
right.
This
is
called
international
union,
international
union
for
of
practical
and
applied
chemistry
right,
practical
and
applied
chemistry .
So,
that
is
I
U
P
A
C.
So
I
U
P
A
C,
that
is
an
or ganization
for
chemistry
who
were
is,
there
are
many
other
bodies
also.
I
am
not
saying
this
is
only ,
there
are
many
other .
So
this
is,
worldwide
renowned
and
accepted
or
acceptable,
that
is
why
I
am
giving
that
reference
that
I
U
P
A
C
has
defined
this
as
the
particle
of
colloidal
dimensions
that
exist
in
equilibrium
with
the
molecules
or
ions
in
solution
from
which
it
is
formed.
I
repeat,
particles
of
colloidal
dimensions
that
exist
in
equilibrium
with
the
molecules
or
ions
in
solution
from
which
it
is
formed,
that
is
the
micelle
right.
So,
this
micelle
word
or
casein
micelle,
you
use
a
typical
and
very
very
complex.
So,
when
we
come
across,
we
see
that
when
we
come
across,
we
see
that
it
is
like
this
right.
Y ou
see
you
see.
So,
this
is
not,
this
is
these
are
the,
I
should
say
some
models
there
are
innumerable
models
for
casein
micelle
right.
Innumerable
models
for
casein
micelle,
this
is
one
for
easy
understanding
or
which
looks
simpler ,
which
looks
easy
to
guess,
easy
to
identify ,
easy
to
remember ,
things
like
that
right.
I
again
I
am
saying
that
casein
micelle
models
are
very
very
high
in
number .
There
are
many
models
available
and
based
on
that
one
a
one
such
model
I
am
just
showing
you
of
course,
this
is
based
on
the
available
resource
from
the
net.
So,
internet
available
resource
from
there,
this
is
one.
So,
liposome
is
one
micelle
is
like
this,
bilayer
sheet
looks
like
this
right
where
that
fellow
has
gone
ok.
So,
my
this
is
then
micelle,
this
is
the,
this
is
the
micelle
right,
you
see
these
are
like
a
small
small
threads
right
or
yeah
threads
that
connected,
this
is
liposome
where
both
this
outer
and
inner
these
are
connected
through
the
thread
like
structure.
This
is
bilayer
sheet
also
like
that
right
and
if
we
look
at
the
part,
you
see
there
are
hydrophilic
head
as
well
as
hydrophobic
tail.
So,
in
aqueous
solution,
this
is
there
that
there
are
hydrophilic
head
and
hydrophobic
tail.
Of
course
the
meaning
of
hydrophilic
and
hydrophobic
we
know ,
hydro
philic,
anything
philic
means
loving,
any
philic
is
loving.
So,
hydrophilic
means
hydro
loving,
hydro
means
water .
So,
water
loving
is
hydrophilic.
Similarly
hydrophoby ,
any
phobic
phobia
is
fear
right
or
there
is
a
tussle
or
there
could
be
repulsion.
So,
that
is
call
phobic
phobia
from
that,
phobic
is
such
where
there
is
repulsion
that
is
afraid
of
or
fear
of
things
like
that
is
here
in
this
case,
it
is
hydro
that
is
water
that
is
water
fear .
Those
water
afraid
of
water .
So,
that
is
call
hydrophobic
right.
So,
hydrophobic
end
that
is
at
one
end,
hydrophilic
end
that
is
at
other
and
all
are
in
the
water
as
the
aqueous
solution
right.
In
aqueous
medium,
it
is
like
that.
So,
it
has
one
hydrophilic
end
and
one
hydrophobic
end.
So,
this
is
what
we
get
right.
So,
if
you
look,
this
is
what
casein
micelle
looks
like
right.
I
hope
we
have
given
more
than
one
ok.
So,
now
we
come
back
to
the
milk
again.
So,
milk
general
characteristic,
how
it
is?
Colour
is
bluish
white
to
almost
golden
yellow
depending
upon
the
breed,
fat
content,
solid
present,
nature
of
feed
consumed.
So,
all
these
parameters
all
these
factors
cause
influence
on
the
colour
of
the
milk
which
is
produced.
Of
course,
you
are
I
don’ t
know
how
many
you
of
you
have
because
nowadays
those
a
particular
in
urban
areas,
those
places
where
cows
and
buf falos,
they
are
rare.
The
those
places
are
no
longer
perhaps
visible
in
particularly
urban
areas,
but
yes
in
may
be
villages
or
interior
of
villages,
still
may
be
there.
And
if
you
have
come
across
with
them
then
you
might
have
seen
the
there
are
many
milkman
who
are
taking
milk
of
dif ferent
colour ,
may
be
white,
may
be
bluish,
may
be
yellowish,
may
depending
on
the
that
right.
So,
where
I
am
not
saying
those
which
are
adulterated
or
those
which
are
already
mixed
with
something,
they
are
all
together
dif ferent.
Naturally
it
can
be
anyone
of
these
colour
bluish
white
to
almost
golden
yellow
depending
upon
the
breed
depending
upon
the
fat
and
solids
present
and
the
nature
of
feed
which
are
consumed
by
the
mammalian
right.
Again,
I
don’ t
know
whether
you
have
seen
or
not,
observed
or
not
that,
if
you
take
a
drop
of
milk
on
a
I
hope
you
have
you
have
seen
microscope
that
I
presume
that
you
have
seen
microscope
and
when
microscope
anythings
are
being
seen.
So,
there
is
a
slide
right,
small
slide,
when
you
people
do
blood
test,
there
also
you
have
seen
that
blood
is
taken
there
and
two
slides
are,
two
slide
are
slided
like
that
right
and
get
those
blood
the
dif ferent
parameters
are
measured
right,
like
that
a
slide
if
you
take
a
slide
and
put
one
drop
of
milk
on
it
right
you
can
see
that
the
through
the
slide,
the
other
part
of
the
slide
you
can
see
right.
This
tells
what
that
milk
could
be
transparent,
isn’ t
it;
that
you
have
taken
a
drop
of
milk
put
on
a
slide
and
you
see
that
slide,
you
can
see
the
other
side
of
this
slide
very
easily
and;
that
means,
that
it
is
like
a
transparent
like
water
right
like
water
if
you
take
in
a
glass
you
can
see
the
other
side
also
right.
But
if
you
take
that
same
milk,
same
source,
same
milk
if
you
take
in
a
test
tube
and
try
to
see
the
other
side
of
the
test
tube,
you
cannot
see;
that
means,
in
small
quantity
in
thin
it
appears
to
be
translucent
or
transparent
but
in
lar ge
quantity
it
appears
to
be
opaque
right.
So,
this
is
again
you
beautiful
nature
of
milk
that
in
thin,
it
is
translucent
and
transparent
or
if
it
is
thick
or
all
lar ge
in
quantity ,
then
it
is
opaque
right.
So,
thin
layer
is
transparent
and
lar ge
quantity
is
opaque
and
also
if
fat
is
removed
sorry
again
if
fat
is
removed,
also
if
fat
is
removed
or
low
fat
milk
is
there,
then
also
it
can
form
bluish
tint
okay
by
the
by ,
today
we
have
only
another
5
minutes
that
is
good
enough
for
to
say
this.
If
you
take
milk
right,
we
said
in
the
beginning
in
the
previous
class
that
milk
is
constituted
of
fat
protein,
carbohydrate,
vitamins,
minerals
and
water
right,
water
of
course
you,
you
can
identify
very
easily
that
separating
everything,
the
remaining
one
is
colourless
water
right.
But
if
you
want
to
identify
this
constituents
of
milk,
though
it
is
not
a
part
of
it
but
still
we
are
handling
with
the
milk.
So,
I
must
also
tell
that
how
we
can
identify
milk
constituents.
So,
you
take
a
test
tube
of
milk
and
then
you
must
have
a
centrifuge.
So,
in
that
centrifuge,
two
test
tubes
are
given
in
opposite
direction
otherwise,
there
will
be
imbalance
of
the
weight.
So,
two
test
tubes
are
given
in
opposite
direction
in
the
centrifuge
and
you
centrifuge
it
for
say
around
10,
15
minutes
right.
So,
after
this
10,
15
minutes
of
this
centrifugation,
now
you,
you
will
get
you
stop
it
and
then
you
take
out
that
that
test
tube,
you
will
see
on
the
top
of
the
test
tube
of
the
milk,
you
will
get
one
yellowish
colour ,
yellowish
colour
like
biscuit
colour
or
golden
yellow
colour
or
thick
thing
is
may
be
a
small,
may
be
a
small
portion
depending
on
what
is
the
percentage
available
in
that.
So,
a
thick
solid
is
appearing
on
that
right
and
if
you
pour
if
you
want
to
pour
the
milk
or
the
rest
of
the
liquid,
you
till
you
will
not
be
right;
obviously ,
if
you
go
on
doing
like
this
if
you
are
giving
lot
of
ener gy
lot
of
lot
of
forces,
then
there
everything
willcome
out
but
just
like
that
you
want
to
decant
you
will
not
be
because
that
solid
is
giving
the
protection
on
the
top.
Now ,
you
make
a
small
hole
by
the
side
of
the
test
tube
right,
small
with
the
needle
you
pierce
it
and
the
moment
you
pierce
it,
you
decant
it
to
another
test
tube.
So,
by
decanting
what
you
are
doing,
you
have
taken
away
the
you
have
taken
away
this
remaining
part
of
the
milk
other
than
that
solid
which
was
there
of
golden
yellow
colour .
Now ,
if
you
take
this
golden
yellow
coloured
material
and
if
you
touch,
you
will
see
that
it
is
slimy ,
it
is
very
very
slimy
and
also
if
you
take
very
minute
quantity
into
with
that
I
said
earlier
about
the
slide,
microscopic
slide.
So,
take
on
a
microscopic
slide,
put
a
very
small
quantity
of
this
this
yellow
part
and
put
50
percent
of
glycerol
glycerol
means
glycerine
50
percent
glycerine,
you
put
there
and
smear
it.
Smear
means
you
make
like
this.
So,
that
is
called
smearing
and
put
one
cover
sleep
on
that
immediately
and
then
look
under
microscope,
then
you
will
see
that
some
things
are
dancing
right
and
this
dancing
is
corresponding
to
your
the
free
movement
of
the
molecules
right.
So,
free
movement
of
the
molecules
that
is
called
dancing.
This
is
dance
that
whatever
is
dancing
that
we
know
this
information
that
milk
fat
is
slimy
is
nature,
milk
fat
is
yellowish
in
colour
and
milk
fat
if
it
is
diluted
and
then
saw
under
microscope,
then
you
will
get
that
dancing
of
the
fat
molecules
for
some
time
till
it
settles
down
right,
till
it’ s
settle
down
you
will
get
that
right
and
this
is
how
you
can
identify
fat.
So,
this
is
that
yellow
portion
we
call
it
to
be
fat.
Then
comes
rest
of
the
thing,
rest
of
the
thing
was
your
yellow ,
white
right
rest
of
the
things
was
your
white
coloured
milk
and
now
you
have
taken
that
white
coloured
milk
and
you
put
some
acid
say
sulphuric
acid
hydrophilic
acid
acidic
acid
or
even
citric
acid
whatever
acid
you
have
in
your
hand.
Y ou
take
that
put
it
suf ficiently
you
don’ t
have
any
other
measuring
thing.
So,
put
it
suf ficiently .
So,
then
an
and
warm
it
a
little
because
that
makes
it
faster
but
it
is
all
ph
dependent.
So,
when
ph
comes
to
4.6
then
that
you
cannot
measure
but
that
is
why
you
have
given
extra,
you
will
see
some
sedimentation
occurred
right
something
has
come
up,
come
down
rather
not
up
something
has
come
down
on
the
lower
part
of
that
test
tube
and
now
you
filter
it
after
filtration
you
will
do
what
you
will
make
a
portion
of
that
a
sediment
that
is
the
solid
or
residue,
a
portion
of
residue
take
and
test
for
nitrogen
by
Kjeldahl
method
right.Y ou
will
get
if
by
Kjeldahl
method
if
nitrogen
is
not
there,
you
will
not
get
that
nitrogen.
So,
if
from
here
it
comes
to
be
nitrogen
and
if
we
know
that
the
by
Kjeldahl
method
normally
6.25
is
multiplied.
So,
that
gives
the
protein
content
or
14
percent
protein
present.
So,
you
can
finally ,
say
that
that
white
marks
which
came
out
is
the
casein
right,
another
part
of
the
milk.
Now
you
have
filtered
after
the
separation
of
this
casein,
you
have
filtered
and
after
filtration,
you
got
again
this
residue
of
casein
and
the
filtrate.
So,
from
the
filtrate
again
that
is
a
colourless
filtrate,
you
take
it
and
warm
it
around
80,
85
degree
centigrade,
then
you
will
see
that
it
has
become
turbid,
again
you
filter
through
a
good
filter
paper
and
take
very
small
quantity
from
that
because
it
will
be
also
quantity
wise
very
small
because
it
has
become
only
turbid.
So,
quantity
wise
it
is
very
small.
So,
that
turbid
thing
will
come
out
and
you
can
test
it
for
nitrogen
through
Kjeldahl
method.
So,
you
can
say
that
is
also
a
protein
and
this
is
called
whey
protein.
Now ,
remaining
solution
after
filtration,
you
got
and
now
you
warm
it
put
Fehling's
A
and
Fehling's
B
right;
Fehling's
A
and
Fehling's
B
in
equal
portion
and
then
heat
it
you
will
see
but
don’ t
put
very
excess
because
Fehling's
A
and
Fehling's
B
both
together ,
it
becomes
a
very
very
bright
blue
colour
right
cuprammonium
complex.
So,
that
just
on
the
back
side
of
this
whatever
is
there
in
the
TV .
So,
that
is
similar
or
even
more
dense
colour ,
blue
colour
like
that.
So,
that
when
you
are
heating.
So,
that’ s
why
I
said
when
you
are
making
Fehling's
A
and
B
do
not
put
in
excess,
then
that
colour
will
be
mer ged.
But
now
if
we
are
putting
some
filtrate
into
it
and
heat
it,
then
you
will
see
there
is
a
brick
red
colour
precipitation.
This
brick
red
colour
precipitation
is
due
to
cuprous
oxide
and
which
is
because
of
the
presence
of
sugar
or
reducing
sugar
present
and
we
know
milk
contains
lactose.
So,
that
is
how
we
can
identify
fat
protein
carbohydrate
present
in
milk.
It
is
dif ficult
to
identify
vitamins
minerals
and
others
because
that
takes
long
time
long
time
maybe
a
day
or
two
for
individual
experimentation.
So,
it
is
easy
you
can
identify
for
this
fat
protein
carbohydrate
in
milk.
T oday
we
are
running
short
of
time.
Thank
you.
