Milk
Homogenization
So
now,
we
are
in
the
46th
class
in
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
right,
we
had
finished
with
standardization,
but
to
have
a
little
more.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:33)
So,
I
am
just
showing
it,
I
am
not
going
through
it
because
now
we
will
go
to
Milk
Homogenization.
So,
before
that
just
showing
that
standardizing
juice
concentrates,
so
this
is
one
such
way
you
can
do
the
standardization.
1
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:49)
And
that
is
simply
by
mass
balance,
so
by
doing
mass
balance
you
can
also
do
this.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:58)
And
using
the
Pearson
square
which
we
have
already
said
earlier
this
is
a
more
elaborative
example
of
doing
that
Pearson
square.
2
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:09)
How
the
Pearson
square
is
being
used
this
is
here
been
shown
and
some
examples
we
have
dealt
with,
and
these
examples
you
can
also
work
out
and
do
that
right
using
the
Pearson’ s
square
technique
also.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:30)
Now ,
we
come
to
homogenization,
so
this
homogenization
is
very
very
important
step
in
milk
because
as
we
have
said
earlier
also
that
milk
do
contain
fat
in
different
sizes
right.
So,
ranging
from
say
decimal
micron
to
around
25-30
µm
this
sizes
are
there
and
fat
do
have
a
3
common
tendency
to
agglomerate.
So,
after
agglomeration
they
became
bigger
sizes
and
from
that
they
do
come
out
to
the
surface
right
this
is
by
going
we
have
said
by
Stokes
law
you
can
find
out
at
what
rate
this
fat
will
get
separated
given
a
diameter
right.
So,
to
avoid
that
for
a
longer
period
to
keep
the
milk
for
a
longer
period
at
no
separation
of
fat.
The
next
step
required
is
pasteurization.
In
pasteurization,
you
have
killed
all
the
pathogenic
organisms.
So,
after
that
you
need
to
homogenize,
so
homogenization
is
for
the
for
the
settlement;
for
the
fixation
of
the
fat
content
right.
So,
that
fat
content
will
not
reduce
because
of
separation
to
do
that
you
need
to
do
say
homogenization.
Now ,
homogenization
is
a
physical
process
of
breaking
down
the
fat
right,
milk
fat
globules
into
tiny
droplets
small,
small
that
will
dictate
at
what
may
be
1
micron,
may
be
2
micron,
may
be
3
micron.
That
size
you
will
decide
and
to
that
all
the
bigger
sizes
will
be
brought
down
of
course,
smaller
sizes
you
cannot
you
cannot
elevate,
but
the
bigger
ones
will
be
brought
down
to
the
smaller
ones
to
discourage
cream
separation;
tiny
droplets
of
fat
do
not
rise
in
a
milk
column
since
reducing
their
sizes
also
increases
their
density
in
the
milk.
Because
more
the
size
bigger
the
size
was
there
less
was
the
number
now
less
is
the
size
bigger
will
be
their
numbers.
So,
more
fat
dense
will
be
there
in
the
particular
or
in
a
density
in
a
particular
one
or
uniformly
it
will
be.
A
milk
fat
a
milk
homogenization
is
working
at
between
100
to
170
bars
that
splits
all
the
fat
globules
into
very
tiny
droplets
that
increases
the
level
of
integration
of
the
fat
in
the
milk.
As
a
result
the
milk
fat
remains
uniformly
distributed
in
the
milk
right.
4(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:03)
Now ,
there
is
a
heating
section
because
milk
homogenization
subsequently
is
seen
that
homogenization
is
also
a
function
of
temperature,
the
higher
the
temperature
better
is
the
homogenization
right.
But
there
is
also
an
optimum
it
is
not
that
it
will
go
on
increasing
like
this
steadily
right,
it
will
not
go
on
increasing
like
this
steadily
that
is
also
there
that
it
will
go
like
this
it
will
be
like
this.
So,
there
will
be
some
optimum
or
maximum
were
the
temperature
is
good.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
that
about
60
to
72°C
is
effective
to
kill
the
Clostridium
botulinum
spores.
The
steam
exchanges
the
heat
with
the
milk
across
the
plate
heat
exchanger
in
a
counter
current
motion
at
the
same
time
at
the
end
of
this
section.
There
is
a
temperature
sensor
which
controls
the
flow
diversion
valve
in
a
milk
that
does
not
attend
the
liquid
temperature
is
diverted
back
to
the
heating
section
until
it
attains
the
required
temperatures
right.
5
(Refer
Slide
Time:
06:32)
Once
you
got
the
temperature
then
holding
section
there
is
a
after
heating
milk
flows
into
the
holding
tubes,
whose
lengths
have
been
have
been
calibrated
with
the
milk
flow
rate
to
ensure
that
the
milk
takes
at
least
16
seconds
in
the
tubes.
All
the
milk
must
remain
in
the
required
pasteurization
temperatures
at
the
end
of
the
tubes.
In
case
of
breach,
a
sensor
will
trigger
the
floor
diversion
valve
to
take
back
the
milk
to
the
heating
section
to
bring
the
milk
to
the
required
temperature.
Once
the
milk
has
attend
the
required
temperature
at
the
end
of
the
holding
tubes
milk
flows
back
to
the
regeneration
section
to
heat
the
incoming
chilled
milk
while
in
itself
being
cooled
down
to
about
30°C.
Now ,
after
that
that
is
again
back
to
a
pasteurization
after
that
it
goes
to
chilling
or
cooling
which
again
is
being
done
by
a
plate
heat
exchanger .
6
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:47)
So,
that
it
is
brought
down
to
after
pasteurization
brought
down
to
4°C
and
the
chilled
milk
is
then
pumped
to
the
packaging
machines
for
aseptic
packaging
ok,
but
before
that
this
is
homogenized
which
we
have
said
that
this
is
done
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:25)
So
while
homogenization
we
do.
7
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:42)
That
homogenization
what
it
does
pasteurize
milk
around
100
to
125
atm
is
allowed
to
pass
through
a
homogenizing
valve
right.
This
homogenizing
valve
it
does
the
homogenization
right,
as
given
in
the
next
figure
will
show
the
figure
is
like
this
let
us
go
back
to
that
figure
which
will
be
easier
to
understand.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:13)
8
So,
this
is
that
homogenization
is
being
done
here,
so
milk
is
flowing
like
this
right.
So,
these
are
the
fat
bigger
fat
globules
they
are
moving
right
through
this
slit;
this
is
the
slit
gap
right
this
is
slit
gap.
So,
through
this
slit
it
is
going;
I
hope
if
you
have
gone
through
our
earlier
class
that
was
on
that
the
naming
of
the
class
was
not
on
milk
that
was
general
class
on
the
fluid
flow
right.
The
fluid
flow
if
you
had
gone
through
there
you
might
have
seen
that
the
velocity
profile
and
all
others
we
have
done
when
it
is
flowing
through
a
slit
like
this
right
that
we
have
done.
So,
there
we
have
not
taken
like
this
the
fat
globules
we
have
taken
a
general
fluid,
but
and
there
we
have
shown
the
velocity
profile
how
the
velocity
profile
is
coming
like
this
right
ok.
But
when
this
fat
globules
are
going
through
this
slit
whose
size
is
according
to
your
desirable
size,
what
do
you
want
2
µm
then
this
size
will
be
2
µm,
if
you
want
3
µm
then
this
size
will
be
3µm.
Therefore,
according
to
your
requirement
this
is
right
and
this
is
a
seat
this
is
the
forcer
which
you
are
adjusting
what
the
distance
will
be
or
how
the
how
the
pressure
will
be.
So,
this
is
going
that
homogenized
fat
globules
which
are
of
smaller
size
like
this
right
these
are
the
smaller
sizes
homogenized
product
is
going
right.
So,
this
is
the
homogenization
valve,
so
if
we
go
back
to
that
if
we
go
back
to
that
then
we
say
that
the
valve
seat
and
the
valve
are
made
cylindrical,
made
of
cylindrical
structure
upward
force
exerted
by
the
homogenized
milk
on
valve
seat
must
overcome
the
downward
ex
exerted
downward
force
exerted
by
spring
on
it
milk
flows
out
radially
through
the
passage
between
the
valve
and
the
seat
during
the
process
what
happens
during
this
process
we
have
show
already
shown
the
valve.
9(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:24)
So,
during
this
process
the
fat
globules
are
sheared
right
this
is
the
fat
globule.
So,
a
force
is
acting
like
this,
so
by
that
they
are
there
is
shear
action
on
the
fat
globule
and
this
fat
globules
then
if
you
look
at
the
other
figure
it
will
be
like
this
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:52)
So,
this
is
the
fat
globule,
so
there
is
a
shear
action
that
is
happening
like
this
and
because
of
that
the
fat
globule
is
getting
say
it
is
enlar ged
view
like
this
they
are
getting
segmented
right
and
ultimately
this
is
becoming
the
intermediate
become
wavy
and
constrict
right.
So,
this
is
10
the
action
of
the
force
this
becomes
wavy
and
constrict
and
this
disintegrate
into
the
individual
droplets
from
this
bigger
droplet
to
the
smaller
ones
they
are
getting
by
the
shear
action.
So,
this
is
splitting
of
globules
by
homogenization
this
mechanism
follows
right.
So,
now
we
go
back
to
that,
so
that
is
what
is
happening
in
the
in
the
homogenization
valve
that
if
the
rate
of
shear
is
large
globules
are
elongated,
ripples
are
formed
on
their
surface
and
finally ,
break
into
smaller
sizes
as
we
have
shown
in
the
next
figure
right,
as
milk
flows
out
radially
along
the
face
say
bb
that
is
not
we
have
not
shown
here
right.
So,
on
the
face
of
the
valve
the
velocity
reduces
due
to
the
increase
in
the
cross
sectional
area
right.
Velocity
is
highest
at
point
say
‘a’
depending
on
the
milk
velocity
at
that
point
this
will
result
in
cavitation
and
pressure
of
milk
will
increase
as
it
moves
radially
outward
from
the
centre
of
the
valve
that
is
from
the
point
‘a’
to
the
point
‘b’.
So,
that
if
we
can
we
can
see
this
show
radially
here
radially
so;
that
means,
it
is
going
like
this
right.
So,
if
this
is
point
‘a’
and
if
this
is
point
‘b’
according
to
that
what
we
are
referring
to
right.
So,
that
is
how
it
is,
so
from
point
‘a’
to
point
‘b’.
Homogenization
of
milk
is
due
to
homogenization
of
milk
is
due
to
the
effect
of
shear
on
the
fat
globules
and
not
on
the
cavitation
though
there
will
be
cavitation,
but
the
fat
globules
are
fat
globules
are
disintegrated
into
smaller
ones
by
the
shear
action
right
this
shear
action
takes
place
and
that
is
what.
Now ,
in
that
cavitation
one
thing
which
will
may
not
be
able
to
explain
in
more
in
detail
that
you
know
that
if
there
is
pressure
in
a
bubble,
and
then
it
gets
exploded
right
that
is
called
explosion.
The
inside
pressure
is
more
than
the
outside
pressure,
but
if
it
is
the
other
way
if
the
outside
pressure
is
more
than
the
inside
then
that
is
called
earlier
it
was
explosion.
Now ,
this
one
will
become
implosion
right
in
cavitation
that
implosion
takes
place
and
by
which.
So,
in
the
fat
globules
also
get
disintegrated
right
this
also
you
keep
in
mind.
11(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:13)
Then
this
we
have
already
said,
so
after
the
fat
globules
are
broken
down
into
smaller
size
and
shear
and
came
out
of
homogenizing
valve
they
are
found
to
remain
sticking
to
each
other
form
a
cluster
and
in
forming
a
cluster ,
in
order
to
bring
the
cluster
and
dispersed
fat
globules
milk
is
passed
through
another
homogenizing
valve,
that
is
that
is
the
second
homogenizing
valve
and
this
second
homogenizing
valve
takes
place,
second
homogenization
and
the
pressure
is
around
one-fifth
to
one-sixth
of
the
first
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:05)
12
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:21)
However ,
this
second
homogenization
valve
so
that
is
like
this
one
from
here
which
goes
to
another
valve
this
one
it
goes
to
another
valve
right,
along
with
this
say
this
is
one
valve
and
say
this
is
acting
around
say
2500
psig
right,
if
this
is
acting
at
that
another
valve
similar
to
this
that
was
around
one
of
this
that
is
500
psig
right.
So,
that
is
called
this
is
called
first
stage
this
is
called
second
stage
homogenization
that
is
two
stage
homogenization
right.
So,
if
we
take
that
then
we
can
say
that
in
the
second
homogenization
it
is
taking
place
at
around
one
fifth
of
the
first
that
is
that
is
if
the
original
was
2500,
now
it
is
500
psig,
why
it
is
required
because
why
it
is
required
because
when
the
first
stage
homogenization
from
the
bigger
to
the
smaller
ones
it
happen
these
smaller
ones
start
to
agglomerate
again
and
again
become
bigger
one
right.
So,
this,
so
that
in
future
in
further
this
should
not
happen
that
second
stage
is
there
and
which
works
at
much
lower
pressure
then
the
former
one
around
one
fifth
of
the
former
one
say
if
the
former
one
is
2500,
now
it
is
500
only
psig
that
is
why
I
am
saying
because
in
bar
it
will
be
much
low
less
in
number .
So,
it
is
and
you
can
convert
in
atmosphere
and
in
Pascal.
So,
those
are
convertable,
but
since
the
number
is
unique
to
2500
psig
and
this
is
500
psig
that
is
why
I
am
giving
the
difference
with
respect
to
psig.
So,
that
the
numbers
you
can
remember
2500
and
500.
So,
these
are
the
13
two
stages
and
these
in
the
second
stage
this
agglomeration
gets
further
ruptured,
and
then
permanently
it
is
form
into
the
smaller
size
as
you
have
decided
2
µm,
3
µm
whatever
right.
The
what
are
the
effects
of
homogenization,
effect
of
homogenizations
are
like
that
that
the
homogenization
increases
its
whiteness
larger
number
of
fat
globules
are
produced
that
is
why
light
is
scattered
then
viscosity
increases,
viscosity
increases
and
this
is
increases
the
shear
force
created
by
the
presence
of
large
numbers
of
fat
globules.
Then
temperature
is
also
increases
because
of
the
friction
on
the
homogenization
valve
as
milk
flows
through
it,
high
at
high
velocity
temperature
is
also
increases
the
hand
and
fourth
one
is
that
gel
strength,
gel
strength
during
milk
curdling
through
microbial
fermentation
acids
joins
the
milk
protein
present
on
the
globule
membrane.
So,
gel
strength
increases,
fresh
milk
contains
lipase
enzymes;
resides
outside
the
fat
globule
membrane
hard
and
hydrolyzes
that
and
transforms
into
free
fatty
acids,
when
comes
in
contact
with
the
fat
this
is
not
desirable
and
undesirable
for
human
consumption
be
under
certain
level.
So,
lipase
enzyme
has
to
be
inactivated
and
this
is
done
during
both
pasteurization
and
homogenization
both
are
at
high
temperature
right.
Now ,
during
homogenization
there
is
a
likelihood
of
lipase
enzymes
to
be
active
in
contact
with
milk
fat
increases
to
inactivate
this
is
heated
up
to
65°C
before
homogenization
or
80°C
is
coagulation
of
whey
protein
if
it
is
beyond
80°C
this
is
done
at
65°C.
If
it
is
beyond
80
degree
centigrade
then
coagulation
of
whey
protein
occurs
because
we
said
whey
protein
is
a
soluble
protein,
but
it
is
soluble
till
the
temperature
is
low
solubility
goes
down
if
the
temperature
goes
beyond
80
degree
centigrade.
So,
that
is
why
you
cannot
heat
beyond
80
degree
centigrade
otherwise
that
that
this
soluble
whey
protein
will
come
out
or
separate
out
from
the
milk
right.

(Refer
Time:

if
you
look
at
this
is
a
true
picture
of
the
valve
where
it
is
going
through,
the
fat
globules
are
like
that
right
it
is
getting
shattered
and
then
becoming
smaller
you
see
the
time
scale
given
is
around
1/10000
second
that
time
it
is
happening.
And
velocity
or
valve
clearance
is
around
300
µm,
this
is
the
schematic
presentation
of
the
homogenization
process
velocity
of
point
3
to
3.5
m/s
is
a
fluid
that
is
milk
velocity
that
is
occurring,
fat
global
size
is
between
1
to
10
µm
say
velocity
of
around
100
to
200
m/s
is
at
the
at
the
inlet
and
because
outside
it
was
low.
So,
the
moment
is
going
into
the
smaller
diameter
you
need
a
smaller
size
velocity
is
increasing
drastically .
Valve
is
around
200
kg/
cm
2
that
is
the
pressure
is
being
applied
and
their
global
deformation
take
place,
like
this
was
the
one
from
where
this
is
gradually
deforming
and
then
coming
to
that.
So,
homogenized
fat
globules
between
point
1
to
3
µm
as
you
are
deciding
that
is
being
produced
right.
So,
this
is
the
flow
diagram
or
the
pictorial
diagram
of
the
fat
globules.
15
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:44)
And
the
valves
are
like
that
there
are
different
types
of
homogenization
valves
different
ways
different
types
right
and
you
see
depending
on
this
is
a
flow
diagram.
So,
They
are
going
through
this
one
is
such
and
there
is
that
this
is
good
going
a
zigzag
path
like
this
right
then
another
one
where
the
slit
is
here.
So,
going
like
this
the
another
one
is
stapered
like
this
going
like
this
is
stapered
right.
And
the
fifth
one
could
be
there
is
a
baffle
in
between
and
that
is
going
through
that
should
bending
on
that
different
size
different
type
different
different
geometry .
They
will
be
different
configuration
there
will
be
different
type
of
pressure
generation,
and
different
fragmentation
also
will
happen
right.
16
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:00)
So,
this
is
a
generalized
homogenizer
that
homogenizer
looks
like
that
the
pictorial
view
homogenizer
looks
like
that,
hopefully
in
any
diary
industry
or
institute
this
type
of
homogenizer
is
there,
and
that
will
dictate
a
pressure,
there
are
two
stage
one
pressure
is
generally
2500
psig
and
another
pressure
is
500
psig
right,
this
is
the
pictorial
view
of
the
valve
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:37)
17
And
milk
travels
to
the
homogenizer
machine
where
the
fat
that
is
cream
is
broken
in
uniformly
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:47)
So,
this
whish
you
I
was
looking
for
that
that
two
stage
this
is
that
typical
two
stage
valve
or
picture
as
you
had
given
figure
2.
This
is
like
that
this
is
the
first
stage,
this
is
the
second
stage
the
milk
is
flowing
through
the
first
stage
again
getting
agglomerated
and
through
the
second
stage
it
is
coming
to
the
smallest
size
as
you
have
given
right
this
is
the
two
stage
homogenizer
valve
right.
18
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:24)
The
theory
is
like
this;
let
us
go
quickly
many
theories
of
the
homogenization
of
high
pressure
homogenization
have
been
presented
over
the
years
for
and
oil
in
water
dispersion
like
milk
where
most
of
the
droplets
are
less
than
1
µm
in
diameter ,
two
theories
have
survived.
Together
they
give
a
good
explanation
of
the
influence
of
different
parameters
on
the
homogenizing
affect.
The
theory
of
globule
disruption
by
turbulent
eddies
that
is
micro
whirls
is
based
on
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
small
eddies,
are
created
in
a
liquid
travelling
at
a
high
velocity
higher
velocity
give
the
smaller
radius.
If
any
eddy
hits
an
oil
droplet
of
its
own
size
the
droplet
will
break
up
this
theory
predicts
how
the
homogenizing
effect
varies
with
the
homogenizing
pressure
this
relation
has
been
shown
in
many
investigation,
the
other
one
is
like
this
that
the
cavitation
theory .
19
(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:41)
The
cavitation
theory
says
that
on
the
other
hand
claims
this
cavitation
theory
claims
that
the
shock
waves
created,
when
the
steam
bubbles
implode
disturb
the
fat
droplets
according
to
this
theory
homogenization
takes
place
when
the
liquid
is
leaving
the
gap.
So,
the
back
pressure
which
is
important
to
control
the
cavitation
is
important
to
homogenization
this
has
also
been
shown
in
practice.
However ,
it
is
possible
to
homogenize
without
cavitation,
but
it
is
less
efficient
right,
so
we
have
ended
up
to
this
class.
Thank
you.
