Amino
Acids
So,
we
completed
what
is
protein
right
and
its
structures
those
we
have
completed.
W e
also
said
if
you
remember
that
amino
acids
are
the
building
block
of
protein
and
protein
is
the
building
block
of
your
body
muscles
right.
So,
we
said
protein
so
let
us
also
look
quickly
amino
acids,
what
is
that
right.
So,
today
in
our
this
class
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology;
lecture
number
27,
we
go
to
amino
acids.
Now ,
in
that
protein
you
might
have
heard
dif ferent
things
like
peptides
right;
peptides,
peptide
bonds
right.
So,
let
us
also
have
a
some
light
or
mild
or
recapitulation
or
may
be
brushing
up
of
your
knowledge
that
what
peptides
are,
what
are
then
proteins
are
and
what
the
peptide
bonds
are?
Because
these
are
some
basic
things
which
normally
students
do
make
mistakes
and
for
understanding
as
much
as
you
recapitulate
or
you
brush
it
up,
it
becomes
more
permanently
stable
in
your
mind
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
that
what
is
peptide?
Peptides
are
short
chains
amino
acids.
Peptides
are
short
chain
amino
acid
right
and
this
is
amino
acid
monomer .
I
hope
monomer ,
dimer ,
polymer
we
understand.
Monomer
is
the
basic
unit
which
cannot
be
further
broken;
can
be
broken,
but
not
normally
that
is
the
if
we
break
a
protein,
we
will
come
to
that
monomer
not
beyond
that
then,
it
is
no
longer
a
altogether
dif ferent
compound.
So,
we
can
come
up
to
the
monomer
which
polymerises
as
depending
on
how
many
of
them
are.
If
it
is
2;
then,
we
call
dimer .
If
it
is
more
than
2;
then,
we
call
it
to
be
polymer
right.
So,
that
is
how
polymerisation.
I
gave
the
example
of
ethylene
and
then,
your
polyethylene
that
which
we
get
every;
nowadays,
every
day
you
get
to
the
from
the
market
sub
polybatgs,
polyethylene
right;
made
of
polymers
of
ethylene
right
like
teflon
that
is
also
a
polymer .
But
a
double
bond
ethane
right
and
tetrafluoroethane
for
that
is
teflon;
however ,
those
are
beyond
our
scope
at
the
moment.
So,
peptides
are
short
chains
of
amino
acid
monomers
linked
by
peptide
chain.
Now ,
peptide
chain
is
also
called
amide
chain
or
amide
bonds
peptide
bonds
or
amide
bonds.
Now ,
how
the
bonding
is
done?
The
covalent
chemical
bonds
are
formed
when
the
carboxyl
group
of
one
amino
acid
reacts
with
the
amino
group
of
another
right.
So,
amino
group,
we
know
this
is
the
amino
group
NH
2
and
carboxylic
group,
we
know
this
is
the
carboxylic
group.
So
this
carboxylic
group
of
one
amino
acid
and
the
amino
group
of
another
amino
acid,
when
they
are
forming
a
bond
then
and
this
bond
is
a
covalent
bond
that
bond
is
called
peptide
bond
or
we
also
called
amide
bond,
peptide
bonds.
Generally
peptide
bond
or
peptide
bonds
are
said
right.
Then,
it
comes
what
is
the
dif ference
between
a
peptide
and
amino
acids?
It
is
like
that
that
you
are
made
of
many
cells.
So,
what
is
the
dif ference
between
you
and
the
cell?
Y es,
cell
is
very
small
and
you
are
the
agglomeration
or
aggregation
of
those
cells
like
that.
The
first
dif ference
is
that
the
that
their
proteins
are
made
of
only
20
dif ferent
amino
acids,
while
peptides
can
be
made
of
this
20
protein
amino
acids
and
of
other
naturally
available
amino
acids.
So,
proteins
are
made
of
20
dif ferent
amino
acids;
whereas,
peptides
can
be
more
that
that
right.
So,
proteins
are
those
which
are
made
of
20
amino
acids
whereas,
peptides
can
be
many
of
them.
Those
20
plus
sub
naturally
available
some
other
amino
acids;
another
basic
dif ference
is
that
the
size
of
the
chain,
that
is,
the
number
of
amino
acids
that
a
protein
or
a
peptide
contains
right.
Normally ,
if
it
is
made
of
peptide
is
made
of
out
of
this
20
amino
acids
right;
then,
that
peptide
is
a
monomer
of
the
protein.So
polymer
of
those
peptides
form
the
proteins;
so,
it
is
number
of
amino
acids
which
are
presents
that
size
is
also
a
basic
dif ference
between
the
peptide
and
proteins.
So,
peptides
are
smaller ,
proteins
are
much
bigger
molecules
basically
right
and
both
are
made
of
amino
acids.
But
when
the
chains
are
small,
chain
lengths
are
small;
then,
we
call
to
be
peptide.
When
the
chain
lengths
are
big
polymers
or
dimer
or
polymer
of
this
amino
acid
peptide,
we
call
that
to
be
protein
right.
Now ,
then
it
comes
that
the
peptide
just
refers
to
two
or
more
amino
acids
linking
together .
So,
a
dipeptide
contain
consists
of
two
amino
acids
linking
together;
whereas,
a
polypeptide
is
more
than
two
amino
acids
linking
together
right.
This
is
n;
this
is
n
right,
make
the
correction.
So,
more
than
two
amino
acids
linking
together
is
a
polypeptide.
Then,
long
strings
or
chains,
the
one
of
the
best
example
of
giving
this
is
that
you
know
girls
or
ladies
they
wear
this
chains
right
and
they
are
they
can
be
made
of
pearl
this
that
beads.
So,
assume
that
each
bead
is
a
amino
acid
and
those
beads
are
linked
through
the
thread.
In
this
case
this
is
the
link
through
the
chain
right.
So,
bond;
this
is
linked
to
through
the
bond.
So,
that
linking
makes
it
a
complete
or
whole
of
the
protein.
So,
this
is
one
of
the
good
examples
that
the
garland
or
necklace
or
whatever
though
those
girls
or
women;
nowadays,
people
men
also
do
wear .
So,
they
are
of
course,
they
do
not
wear
menâ€™ s
we
I
as
far
as
I
have
seen
only
chains
of
gold,
but
girls
do
wear
many
types
like
may
be
made
of
many
beads
as
I
referred
pearl
this
that
I
am
not
conversed;
so,
many .
However ,
so,
those
beads
if
we
assume
them
to
be
individual
amino
acids;
then,
these
amino
acids
are
like
the
beads
are
linked
through
a
thread
and
it
becomes
a
complete
garland.
Flower
garland
is
also
like
each
flower
like
that
beads
or
like
that
amino
acid.
So,
they
are
linked
through
the
thread
and
here
it
is
linked
through
the
peptidic
bonds
right.
So,
long
strings
or
chains
of
thousands
of
long
chains
strings
or
chains
of
thousands
of
the
20
amino
acids
that
form
proteins
linking
together
from
the
proteins
that
exit
in
the
body
right.
These
chains
generally
consist
of
repeated
sequences
of
specific
amino
acids
right.
These
amino
acids
are
like
that
repeated
sequence
depending
on
what?
When
we
come
to
the
amino
acids
typically
that
time
we
will
see
there
are
how
many
and
in
what
way
they
are
dif ferent
right.
So,
it
is
the
side
groups
which
make
each
amino
acid
dif ferent
from
the
others.
So,
because
each
amino
acid
will
have
1
COOH
group
and
1
central
carbon
or
called
alpha
carbon
and
we
will
have
1
amino
group
right.
So,
this
one
amino
group
and
you
will
have
1
this
R;
that
is
this
makes
the
dif ference
that
this
is
called
the
side
chain
group
right
and
this
can
be
ok
at
the
moment
this
is
this
may
be
joined
or
may
not
be
joined
depending
on
that.
So,
this
3
are
the
units
for
the
amino
acid;
this
R
can
be
the
side
chain
group
and
based
on
that
the
dif ference
in
the
amino
acids
occur
right.
So
if
then,
if
we
look
at
a
protein
is
a
chain
of
amino
acids.
A
chain
of
amino
acids
connected
together .
So,
you
can
think
of
like
a
bead
a
just
like
I
said
that
beaded
necklace,
the
beads
which
are
just
like
amino
acids
are
connected
together
by
a
string
that
is
the
bond.
This
string
is
nothing
but
the
bond
right
peptidic
bond,
which
forms
a
long
chain
protein.
Therefore,
a
protein
is
intact
or
whole
like
the
beads
which
we
are
saying
like
this
right.
So,
they
are
forming
the
entire
chain;
this
is
the
complete
or
whole
protein
right.
So,
like
the
beads
these
are
connected
through
the
thread,
in
this
case
through
the
bond
and
these
bonds
are
that
bond
can
be
N-type
dif ferent
we
will
come
afterwards
right.
So,
this
long
chains
are
forming
the
proteins
right.
Now ,
amino
acids
are
the
basic
building
blocks
of
enzymes,
hormones,
proteins
and
body
tissues
of
our
system
right.
So,
it
is
the
basic
building
block
of
enzyme
because
we
know
all
enzymes
are
a
kind
of
proteins
right;
all
enzymes
are
kind
of
proteins,
hormones,
they
are
also
proteins;
then
proteins
itself
and
the
body
cells
or
tissues.
So,
they
are
all
composed
of
amino
acids;
so,
amino
acids
has
a
great
function
in
the
body
right.
Fortunately
or
unfortunately
you
will
see
some
of
which
our
body
can
synthesize
and
some
of
which
our
body
cannot
synthesize
right
and
that
makes
the
dif ference
between
essential
and
non-essential
amino
acid.
So,
this
is
when
I
said
earlier
also
with
respect
to
fat
also
that
essential;
yes,
the
term
essential.
This
essential
is
essential
means
essential
by
the
body ,
essential
by
the
body
system;
be
it
fat,
be
it
protein
right.
Be
it
fat,
be
it
protein;
body
cannot
synthesize.
Body ,
our
body
system
I
referred
earlier
also
if
you
go
through
biochemistry
leninzer ,
you
get
more
detailed
things
into
that
that
if
our
body
system
cannot
synthesize
that
particular
thing
is
called
essential,
like
essential
fat
or
essential
amino
acid
or
yeah,
essential
amino
acids
and
this
and
in
that
case
essential
carboxylic
acids
which
we
said
fatty
acids
right,
essential
fatty
acids
ok.
Now
so,
a
peptide
is
a
compound;
a
peptide
is
a
compound
consisting
of
2
or
more
amino
acids;
consisting
of
2
or
more
amino
acids
that
is
a
peptide;
whereas,
polypeptides
and
proteins
are
consisting
of
10
or
more
amino
acids
right.
So,
peptide
is
small
proteins
or
polypeptides
are
bigger
in
size.
So,
that
is
the
basic
fundamental
dif ference
between
a
peptide
and
the
protein.
Both
are
made
of
amino
acid
building
block
is
same
amino
acid.
But
1
in
size
wise
very
small
and
other
that
function
is
also
a
quite
little
dif ferent
right.Because
peptide
may
have
some
side
ef fects;
somebody
may
have
some
of
itching
or
this
that.
So,
those
are
beyond
our
purview
right.
Peptides
consisting
of,
but
peptides
consisting
of
more
than
50
amino
acids
are
classified
as
proteins
right.
Peptides
consisting
of
more
than
50
amino
acids
are
called
proteins
right.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
the
dif ference
between
nucleic
acid
the
earlier
day ,
earlier
classes
we
discussed
about
this
when
we
were
talking
about
proteins
right.
So,
there
we
have
seen
the
nucleic
acid
right.
Y ou
remember
nucleic
acid
also
had
one
5
member
carbohydrate
or
sugar
right
one
5
member
carbohydrate
or
sugar
it
had,
1
amino
group
or
1
phosphate
group
right;
these
3
or
nitrogenous
group
and
1
phosphate
group.
These
3
were
the
building
block
of
the
nucleic
acid
right.
If
you
remember ,
out
of
it
is
if
the
carbohydrate
is
ribose;
then,
we
call
it
to
be
ribonucleic
acid
or
RNA.
And
if
the
carbohydrate
or
sugar
is
made
of
deoxyribose;
then,
we
call
it
to
be
deoxyribonucleic
acid
or
DNA
right.
So,
what
is
the
dif ference
between
that
and
the
amino
acid?
Because
the
amino
acid
also
we
have
seen,
there
are
3
such
building
blocks
in
amino
acid.
One
is
amino
group,
another
is
carboxylic
acid
group
and
third
one
is
the
R
that
is
the
that
is
a
functional
group;
I
should
say
like
it
could
be
it
could
be
any
type
of
R,
as
you
think
of
depending
on
that
R;
it
is
it
is
dif ferent
amino
acid
which
is
coming
in.
Because
other
two
remain
same
carboxylic
acid,
amino
group,
they
are
identical
for
all
the
amino
acids.
But
these
are
varies
right
though
that
could
be
alkyl
or
many
we
will
come
into
that
ok.
So,
nucleic
acid,
nucleic
acid
or
RNA
or
DNA
are
made
up
of
a
series
of
nucleotides
right.
W e
said
that
nucleotide
is
the
unique
or
unit
or
building
block
of
the
nucleic
acid
right.
So,
the
centre
of
an
amino
acid
is
the
carbon
bonded
to
4
dif ferent
groups.
The
fourth
group
is
the
R
right
and
this
R
is
dif ferent
for
dif ferent
amino
acids
right.
A
nucleotide
is
also
composed
of
five-carbon
sugar ,
a
nitrogenous
base
and
a
phosphate
group
right.
So,
both
are
you
see
similarity ,
but
functional
group
wise
they
are
dif ferent.
So,
one
contains
carboxylic
acid
group
right;
whereas,
another
contains
and
carboxylic
acid
group,
then
your
amino
group
and
this
R
or
that
alkyl
group
or
similar
like
that.
This
is
the
amino
acid;
whereas,
there
it
is
a
sugar
group
and
a
nitrogenous
group
and
a
phosphate
group
right.
Functional
groups
are
then
dif ferent,
but
the
similarity
in
unit
building
is
there
right.
So,
all
amino
acids
have
the
alpha
carbon
bonded
to
a
hydrogen
atom
right.
All
amino
acids
have
the
alpha
carbon
bonded
to
a
hydrogen
atom.
So
which
we
were
saying
that
C,
this
was
COOH
and
this
was
NH
2
and
this
was
your
R
and
this
fourth
one
is
all
the
time
associated
with
hydrogen
right.
And
then,
to
hydrogen
and
carboxyl
group
and
amino
group
right.
The
R
which
we
are
referring
to
group
varies
among
amino
acids
and
determines
the
dif ference
between
these
protein
monomers.
So,
these
we
are
called
colleague
protein
monomer
right
because
from
that
monomer
dimmer
or
polymers
are
being
made.
So,
that
is
the
basic
unit
amino
acid
right.
So,
the
genetic
code
is
the
sequence
of
nucleotide
based
in
nucleic
acids
or
DNA
and
RNA
that
code
for
amino
acids
right.
So,
they
also
do
have
like
in
amino
acid
in
nucleic
acids,
this
DNA,
RNA
they
do
have
some
genetic
code.
Here
also
in
amino
acids,
they
do
have
some
code.
So,
this
coding
will
be
there
also
a
similarity
right,
but
the
coding
are
all
together
dif ferent
right.So,
then
we
come
that
there
are
20
amino
acids
and
these
20
amino
acids
are
there
in
our
body
systems
right;
body
proteins
do
have
this
20
amino
acids
out
of
which
nine
are
essentials.
Earlier
it
was
in
our
time
we
use
to
hear
that
8
was
the
essential
amino
acids,
but
with
time
dif ferent
things
are
getting
invented
and
yeah,
at
the
moment
it
is
said
to
be
9.
9
essential
amino
acids
are
there
right
and
these
9
amino
acids
must
be
there
in
our
diet
right.
Because
our
body
when
it
is
doing
some
exercise
or
building
the
protein,
that
time
if
these
amino
acids
are
not
being
built
by
the
body
or
produced
by
the
body;
then
that
protein
that
typical
protein
cannot
be
synthesized,
cannot
be
built.
So,
you
will
lack
of
those
things.
So,
that
is
why
that
in
your
diet
it
has
to
be
supplemented
such
that
our
body
can
get
those
amino
acids
and
can
make
it
very
easily
right.
So,
the
proteins
can
be
built.
Now ,
this
20
amino
acids
are
there
in
our
body
out
of
which
9
are
essential
and
we
get
this
9â€™ s
in
our
diet
right.
Because
our
cells
cannot
manufacture
them
and
these
9â€™ s
are
histidine,
isoleucine,
leucine,
lysine,
methionine,
phenylalanine,
threonine,
tryptophan
and
valine.
And
you
will
see
all
of
them
do
have
dif ferent
naming
right,
all
of
them
do
have
dif ferent
code;
so
that
you
can
identify
them
right
like
lysine
though
it
begins
with
L,
but
it
has
a
code
of
k
be
a
to
z;
there
are
20
our
alphabets
are
26.
So,
6
can
be
omitted.
So,
like
that
O
is
one
omitted
like
that
L,
because
L
is
another
leucine
right.
So,
already
there
so
that
is
why
lysine
is
not
given
that
code.
It
is
k
like
that
they
are
dif ferent.
So,
we
finish
this
class
with
repetition
that
the
basic
amino
acids
which
our
body
cannot
synthesize
are
called
essential
amino
acids.
And
they
are
histidine,
isoleucine,
leucine,
lysine,
methionine
and
phenylalanine
threonine,
tryptophan
and
valine
right.
These
are
our
basic
essential
amino
acids
right.
So,
time
is
up.
Thank
you.
