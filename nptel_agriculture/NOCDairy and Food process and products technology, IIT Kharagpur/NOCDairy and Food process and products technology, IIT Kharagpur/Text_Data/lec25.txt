Protein
So,
we
have
finished
fat
as
a
whole
and
milk
fat
in
particular
right?
Now
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Product
T echnology
in
lecture
25,
we
start
with
Protein,
right?
Some
basics
of
protein
because
as
we
said
that
unless
this;
these
are
macronutrients
fat,
protein,
carbohydrates
these
are
macronutrients.
And
unless
we
know
this
macronutrients;
this
chemistry
a
little,
then
there
is
less
dif ference
between
you
and
people
or
engineer
or
scientist
from
other
disciplines.
So,
you
must
also
know
some
little
chemistry
of
the
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate
as
such;
otherwise
it
will
be
very
dif ficult
to
dif ferentiate
and
this
being
a
course;
where
we
can
also
impart
a
little
knowledge
on
that.
So,
why
do
not
we
take
that
chance
that
is
my
objective
that
ok
there
is
no
prerequisite,
but
understanding
also
need
some;
so
when
we
say
casein
micelle
that
time
we
will
be
in
the
deap
soup
that
what
is
that.
So,
we
to
understand
that
and
protein
fat,
they
are
so
complex
as
you
have
seen
in
the
fat
also;
they
are
so
complex
in
molecule,
in
size
and
in
it
is
behavior ,
in
its
reactions
that
unless
some
chemistry
is
taught
about
or
some
chemistry
background
is
created;
it
is
very
dif ficult
to
follow
right?
So,
we
come
to
protein
right.
Protein
what
it
is?
Protein
is
a
macro
nutrient
that
is
essential
to
build
muscle
mass
right.So,
that
this
muscle
we
have
right.
So,
this
muscle
mass
is
comprised
of
protein.
So,
this
muscle
mass
is
comprised
of
protein
and
this
is
true
for
any
living
unit
right.
Any
living
unit
this
is
true;
whether
it
is
human,
animal
or
any
micro
macro
or
micro;
this
is
true
right.
So,
where
from
it
comes?
That
is
the
primary
thing
right.
So,
protein
is
a
macronutrient
that
is
essential
to
build
the
muscle
mass,
it
is
commonly
found
in
animal
products
through.
It
is
may
commonly
found
in
animal
products,
though
is
also
present
in
other
sources
such
as
nuts
and
legumes.
So,
commonly
this
protein
comes
from
the
animals
products,
because
animal
protein
is
more
available.
And
you
will
not
get
plant
origin
food
much
in
protein,
other
than
this
like
nuts,
legumes,
then
cereal,
little
cereals,
pulses
they
do
also
have
good
quantity
of
proteins
right.
So,
primarily
it
comes
from
the
animal
source
as
well
from
the
plants
source.
So,
in
the
beginning
we
had
said
if
you
remember
that
we
get
everything
from
both
animal
sources
and
plant
sources
right.
And
there
is
no
such
distinctions
in
science
about
the
vegetarian
and
non
vegetarian,
but
protein
also
comes
from
both
plant
origin
and
animal
origin.
Animal
origin
it
is
more,
because
they
come
from
the
muscle
where
major
part
of
the
protein
is
being
coming
from
the
muscles
of
the
animals
right.
So,
to
build
those
animals
muscles
these
are
required,
to
maintain
those
muscles
this
is
required;
the
material
which
is
required
is
called
protein.
There
are
three
macro
nutrients
protein,
fats
and
carbohydrates
and
these
macronutrients
provide
calories
or
ener gy .
The
body
requires
lar ge
amounts
of
macronutrients
to
sustain
life
and
they
come
from
dif ferent
sources
as
it
is
appearing
from
this
picture
that,
it
is
mixture
of
these
animals.
So
this
is
the
plant
sources
and
these
are
some
animal
sources,
which
have
come
this
may
be
from
some
dairy
sources
also.
Like
meat,
seafood,
poultry ,
grains,
beans,
dairy
products
they
are
good
sources
of
protein
right.
So,
many
dairy
products
they
do
also
have
lot
of
protein
and
many
plant
origin
products
like
beans,
grains,
they
do
have
lot
of
proteins
as
well
the
poultry ,
seafood
and
meat.
Of
course,
this
poultry
includes
all
like
chicken,
duck
then
many
others
right.
So,
protein
is
the
primarily
the
building
block
of
the
muscles
right.
Then
it
comes
what
protein
is
made
of.
Automatically
it
comes
if
the
building
block
of
muscles
is
protein,
then
what
is
the
building
block
of
animal
this
protein
right?
So,
each
gram
of
protein
contains
4
calories
which
we
have
seen
earlier
their
fat
contains
9;
fat
gives
rather
9
kilo
calories
of
each
gram
contains
4;
this
should
be
kilocalories
not
calorie
right
4;
make
this
change
and
this
C
should
be
capital
right
ok.
So,
each
gram
of
protein
contains
4
kilo
calories
right?
Like
as
we
have
seen
each
gram
of
fat
gives
9
kilo
calories
and
each
gram
of
carbohydrate
gives
again
4
kilo
calories.
And
the
reason
why
we
are
saying
in
M
K
S;
kilo
calories
we
had
said
earlier
also
that
these
numbers
are
whole
numbers
to
remember
ok.
So,
proteins
makes
up
about
15
percent
of
any
persons
weight.
Around
15
percent
of
the
body
weight
is
from
the
protein
of
the
person
right?
And
we
said
that
this
protein
is
building
your
muscle
muscle
building
block
is
the
protein
ok.
So,
chemically
protein
is
composed
of
amino
acids
right;
so
amino
acids
means
amino
acid
that
is
having
both
acid
as
well
as
amino
group
together
right?
Both
acid
as
well
as
amino
group
together;
some
day
if
pulse
will
in
some
class,
I
will
also
tell
about
the
amino
acids
because
there
are
20
amino
acids
right?
20
amino
acids
out
of
which
some
are
essential
amino
acids
and
some
are
not
essential.
Now ,
what
we
also
said
about
essential?
Earlier
also
we
said
about
this
essential
and
non
essential
that
was
in
terms
of
if
you
remember
fat
we
said
or
in
terms
of
in
terms
of
your
that
in
the
fat,
we
had
said
this
essential
part
essential
oil,
we
had
said
that
those
which
we
are
our
body
cannot
synthesize.
Here
also
those
amino
acids
which
body
cannot
synthesize
is
called
the
amino
essential
amino
acids;
someday
will
come
to
that
a
little
detail
so,
that
the
encompassing
of
the
entire
thing
is
rightly
done.
However ,
let
us
for
the
time
being
take
it
that,
protein
is
made
of
amino
acids
which
are
or ganic
compounds
made
of
carbon,
hydrogen,
nitrogen,
oxygen
or
sulphur
sometimes;
it
may
also
called
carrying
sulphur
along
with
that.
So,
the
basic
elements
hydrogen,
oxygen,
nitrogen,
sulphur
and
nitrogen,
hydrogen
carbon
all
these
all
these
constitutes
the
amino
acids.
Amino
acids
are
the
building
block
of
these
proteins
and
proteins
are
the
building
block
of
the
muscle.
So,
muscle
our
muscle
is
built
by
the
protein;
protein
is
built
by
the
amino
acids
right?
So,
they
are
the
building
block
of
amino
acids;
I
remember
if
during
your
childhood
I
hope
during
your
childhood
you
have
played
with
many
building
blocks
right.
So,
if
you
consider
those
building
blocks
as
one
of
the
dif ferent
amino
acids,
then
the
blocks
which
you
had
made
they
also
constitute
like
dif ferent
proteins
right.
So,
they
are
depending
on
your
imagination
as
many
proteins
you
as
many
blocks
you
could
have
designed
or
developed.
So,
here
also
as
many
proteins
you
can
think
of
with
the
help
of
these
amino
acids
in
combinations
you
can
make
as
much
that
is
called
as
the
amino
acid
sequence,
we
will
come
gradually
right.
So,
amino
acids
are
the
building
blocks
of
the
proteins
and
proteins
are
the
building
blocks
of
the
muscle.
When
protein
is
broken
down
in
the
body ,
it
helps
to
fuel
muscle
mass
which
helps
metabolism
right.
So,
whenever
we
are
consuming;
we
are
taking
something
and
that
is
the
food.
So,
in
that
food
we
are
taking
maybe
some
amino
some
proteins
directly .
So,
and
those
proteins
are
to
be
assimilated
by
the
body
and
in
that
case
we
do
with
the
help
of;
ourbody
rather
our
body
heat
takes
with
the
help
of
dif ferent
other
enzymes
and
dif ferent
other
supporting
materials,
they
break
them
and
then
make
them
as
per
requirement
of
the
body
right?
So,
this
is
the
body
building
that
mass
is
being
built
from
the
protein.
So,
in
the
metabolism
this
helps
and
when
you
are
getting
the
in
the
metabolism
of
the
protein;
we
get
the
ener gy
of
working,
ener gy
of
talking,
ener gy
of
reading;
all
these
do
come
from
them
right.
It
also
helps
to
immune
our
system
and
it
allows
to
stay
strong
it
helps
to
stay
full
and
also
satisfy
your
satiety
right.
Satiety
is
that
the
appetite
to
take
food;
appetite
to
take
food
that
is
the
satiety .
So,
if
that
gets
full
then
you
don’ t
wish
to;
you
don’ t
want
to
take
more.
So,
this
protein
when
you
are
consuming
this
also
gives
you
that
satiety
that
is
the
feeling
for
that
the
fullness
of
the
consumption
that
is
also
an
indicator .
So,
it
also
helps
to
make
you
full
or
have
satisfied
with
the
content
you
have
consumed
that
is
called
satiety
right?
So,
how
much
protein
we
should
take?
That
is
and
coming;
and
how
much
protein
we
should
take?
A
safe
level
of
protein
ranges
from
say
around
0.8
grams
protein
per
kilogram
of
the
body
weight
of
the
person.
This
is
roughly
right,
0.8
gram
per
kilogram
right.
So,
roughly
we
can
say
1
gram
per
kilogram
right
and
it
may
go
up
to
2
gram
per
kilogram
body
weight
for
the
people
who
are
very
active
right;
like
sports
persons
right.
They
do
work;
much
much
more
than
you
or
me
normally
right?
Because
they
are
running
around
like
the
those
players
football
players,
cricket
players
they
are
running
around
typically
or
basket
or
in
any
such
badminton
or
any
such
sports
persons
they
do
need
or
athletic,
they
do
need
lot
of
ener gy ,
lot
of
protein
and
they
can
go
up
to
2
grams
per
kg
body
weight
right.
So,
if
somebody
is
roughly
say
100
kg
body
weight
say
then
1
kg
body
weight
2
gram;
so,
100
kg
body
weight
is
20
gram;
you
can
take
right
that
is
the
daily
intake
roughly
this
is
right;
just
to
have
some
idea
ok.
And
this
from
1
gram
to
2
gram;
this
varies
from
person
to
person
right?
This;
obviously ,
varies
from
person
to
person
and
that
is
why
you
see
some
people
are
thin
and
some
lean
and
thin
and
some
people
are
very
healthy
stout.
So
that
primarily
because
the
building
block
that
is
the
protein
was
dif ferent
for
the
persons
and
body
requirement
also
are
quite
dif ferent
for
this
big
and
thin
and
heavy
and
stout
person.
So,
we
come
that
roughly
1
to
2
gram
per
kg;
it
could
be
a
intake
for
the
person
right.
And
to
get
this
quantity
of
protein
say
20
gram
of
protein
is
not
that
in
a
milk;
is
not
that
easy
because
to
get
20
gram
of
protein,
you
may
have
to
have
may
be
200
grams
or
even
more
some
material
and
then
only
because
none
of
the
materials
are
full
of
protein
right
none
of
the
materials;
materials
I
mean
the
food
is
full
of
protein.
So,
to
get
20
gram
you
may
have
2
gram
200,
400
grams
of
the
total
other
total
quantity
and
you
as
such
you
never
may
not
be
able
to
consume
so,
much
quantity;
that
is
why
that
limit
ah.
Because
you
cannot
have
only
protein
in
I;
I
remember
in
one
of
our
there
in
when
we
were
student
and
we
were
being
taught
by
our
teachers.
And
that
time
one
day
one
teacher
he
said
like
this
that
ok
the
way
things
are
proceeding,
the
way
science
is
progressing
maybe
someday
it
will
come
that
you
take
one
spoon
of
one
spoon
of
protein,
one
spoon
of
fat,
one
spoon
of
carbohydrate
or
all
put
together
maybe
one
bigger
spoon
and
your
entire
body
requirement
is
over
or
though
it
may
not
be
like;
I
give
a
similar
example
that
computer
science
is
also
progressing
I
mean
like
a
rocket
right.
So,
now
everything
is
in
your
hand
even
pumped
up
things
are
also
there
and
everything
you
are
able
to
do
right.
But
you
imagine
that
the
keyboard
that
size
is
like
this
right?
This
keyboard
size
cannot
be
made
that
small;
the
reason
being
the
limiting
factor
is
your
finger
because
you
are
keying
this;
you
are
typing
this;
so
that
is
the
limiting
factor
right?
Similarly ,
there
if
you
can
isolate
protein
fat
carbohydrates
like
that
and
make
a
concentrate
like
that
your
body
requirement
is
this
much.
So,
1
spoon
or
2
spoon
you
have
taken
and
your
things
are
over;
may
not
be
the
reason
being
your
body
is
so,
much
built
up
that
it
is
not
onlythat
some
other
materials
are
also
required
and
also
you
need
to
satisfy
your
hunger .
So,
it
is
not
only
ener gy ,
but
also
hunger
is
also
another
part.
So,
that
time
it
was
said
it
just
came
to
my
mind;
I
am
sharing
with
you
that
it
was
said,
but
yes
someday
it
may
come
land
up
to
that
level
that
you
have
segregated
all
the
requirements
and
concentrated
to
that
level
that
only
you
take
a
spoon
of
the
entire
think
and
your
body
requirement
is
over
as
per
as
nutrition
is
concerned.
But
that
is
not
all
because
you
have
to
have
the
feeling
that
you
have
consumed
something;
after
eating
if
you
feel
still
hungry
that
your
satiety
is
not
over
that
is
not;
right?
But
science
is
progressing
into
that
extend
someday
it
may
come
forward
or
someday
it
may
be
like
that
ok.
Then
we
come
to
the
structure
what
is
the
protein
made
of
we
have
seen;
it
is
made
of
the
building
block
is
the
amino
acids
right.
So,
more
proteins
fold
into
unique
3
dimensional
structures;
the
shape
into
which
a
protein
naturally
folds
is
known
as
its
native
conformation
right?
Here
on
in
this
statement,
we
have
said
many
things
which
we
need
to
explain
also
right?
W e
have
said
most
proteins
fold;
now
we
know
folding
of
papers,
we
know
folding
of
papers
right.
So,
what
do
we
understand
by
the
term
fold?
W e
also
said
and
native
conformation
right.
So,
these
things
have
to
be
also
elaborated;
otherwise
if
they
are
not
understood
then
the
whole
understanding
of
the
whole
will
not
come
forward,
will
not
be
achieved
right
or;
obviously ,
I
will
try
to
explain
them
as
and
when
it
is
possible
right.
So,
this
is
like
that
new
terms
will
come
up
and
we
will
try
to
explain
them,
we
will
try
to
elaborate
them
so
that
our
understanding
becomes
much
easier
ok.
Then
protein
by
the
by
the
by
the
by
when
we
it
has
come
conformation
this
is
an
English
word
of
course,
conformation
that
is
the
shape
and
structure
shape
and
structure
of
anything
that
is
sent
in
terms
of
conformation
right.
So,
shape
and
structure
of
anything
in
terms
of
conformation
that
will
come;
protein
is
or
protein
folding
is
the
physical
process
right
by
which
a
protein
chain
acquires
its
native
3
dimensional
structure;
that
is
conformation
that
is
usually
biologically
functional
in
an
expeditious
and
reproducible
manner
right.
So,
again
some
more
terminologies
we
have
brought
right;
like
physical
process
that
is
one
what
is
holding
by
to
explain
what
is
folding;
we
brought
into
physical
process,
we
have
brought
into
again
native
and
3
dimensional.
3dimensional
we
understand
that
is
x
y
z
that
is
the
3
dimensional
space
right,
x
y
z
that
is
3
dimensional
understandable.
So,
it
has
a
one
all
these
3
direction
because
now
this
TV ;
which
you
are
watching
that
is
also
not
3
dimensional,
that
is
2
dimensional
right?
The
third
dimension
is
in
your
our
mind
and
mind
gradually
makes
it
at
par
with
that
is
why
you
see
my
face
to
be
like
that
3
dimension,
but
the
TV
is
2
dimensional
right
x
and
y;
no
z,
but
that
z
comes
from
the
mind
ok.
So,
3
dimensional
we
understand;
physical
process
we
have
to
say
native,
we
have
to
say .
Then
biological
functional,
biologically
functional
means
that
when
all
the
things
because
we
have
said
that
protein
is
the
building
block
of
all
the
living
part
right?
Not
only
muscle;
protein
maybe
the
building
block
of
all
the
living
part.
So,
it
is
part
of
the
life
ok
that
we
will
come
up
when
subsequently
when
we
are
also
explaining
the
DNA,
RNA;
so
that
the
building
block
of
life.
So,
from
there
it
is
also
there;
so
everywhere
it
is
again
the
amino
acids
which
are
coming
into.
So,
another
term
which
we
have
just
said
that
expeditious;
reproducible
we
understand
that
the
same
thing
that
is
called
reproducible;
the
same
thing
if
you
can
recur
that
is
called
reproducible
means
you
can
bring
same
thing,
same
exactly
one
to
one
identical
then
it
called
reproducible.
But
what
is
expeditious?
That
expeditious
meaning
that
it
is
number
1;
absolutely
accurate
and
number
2;
very
speedy ,
highly
speedy .
So,
accurate
as
well
as
PD;
reproducible
manner
if
it
is
doing
in
a
biological
manner
or
biologically
functional;
that
means,
what
we
said
the
other
day
that
it
is
not
only
chemistry ,
but
also
biochemistry
that
you
come
across
along
with
this
food.
Because
whenever
you
are
consuming,
it
is
going
to
your
stomach
which
is
the;
which
is
nothing,
but
a
reactor ,
chemical
reactor
like
that
it
is
a
reactor
where
everything
whatever
you
are
consuming
is
going
in
and
then
getting
digested.
So,
in
that
digestion
process
lot
of
breaking
making
things
are
happening;
with
lot
of
many
others
associated
submitted
things
right?
So,
those
could
be
called
as
the
biologically
active
functions
right
or
functions
which
are
doing
by
biologically
things
have
being
done
biologically
right.
So,
we
will
explain
the
other
native
and
physical
process
in
the
next
class
ok.Thank
you.
