Preamble
of
the
Subject
Good
morning,
today
we
are
doing
our
first
class
on
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
right.
Now ,
from
the
name
itself,
food
is
a
very
vast
subject.
If
you
go
to
the
history ,
then
you
will
see
that
in
couple
of
decades
back
this
was
originally
clubbed
with
chemical
engineering.
Now ,
after
that
when
people
used
to
know
more
about
food,
then
they
thought
that;
let
this
food
be
segregated/separated
from
chemical,
because
chemical
itself
is
a
big
and
that
was
also
expanding.
So,
from
the
umbrella
of
chemical
engineering,
this
food
has
come
out.
Now
after
the
several
decades,
food
also
has
been
expanded
and
I
do
not
say
that
tomorrow
food
will
be
disintegrated
to
some
other
areas,
but
yes
associated
many
things
are
also
there
like
microbiology ,
that
is
altogether
a
separate
subject,
then
your
processing
itself
that
comes
under
both
mechanical
chemical
in
many
many
places
so
depending
on
what
you
are
handling,
what
you
are
doing
your
course
umbrella
is
accordingly
selected.
Then
the
question
comes
very
first
that
where
to
start
and
where
to
end;
obviously ,
because
what
we
will
do?
In
every
courses,
the
same
preamble
is
not
liked
by
you,
many
of
you
may
under go
different
courses
or
similar
courses,
then
it
becomes
monotony
for
you,
that
is
why
there
are
something
to
start
with.
Since,
under
this
MOOC
this
type
of
course,
is
the
first
time
you
have
registered
yourself,
that
time
you
have
seen
the
course
content,
course
material,
I
will
also
show
you
a
once
again
here.
There,
I
have
not
given
any
prerequisite.
The
reason
being
that
if
you
want
to
start
something;
where
you
start.
If
you
start
writing
a
sentence,
if
you
start
learning
from
A,
B
then
there
will
be
no
end.
Your
objective
is
to
write
the
sentence.
So,
it
is
supposed
that
you
know
A,
B
etcetera
how
to
write,
and
then
you
know
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
the
expression
of
the
sentence,
then
only
you
can
write.
Here
also
we
would
like
to
bring
a
some
preliminary
things
for
your
understanding
so
that
in
the
long
run
when
the
course
is
almost
halfwayor
almost
to
the
end,
you
do
not
have
the
problem
that
these
were
not
known;
these
were
to
be
told
etcetera.
So,
some
preliminary
things
are
definitely
I
will
try
to
describe.
Then
it
comes,
why
should
we
take
this
course?,
what
is
the
objective,
what
is
the
purpose.
If
you
did
not
take
the
or
register
in
this
course;
what
do
you
would
have
lost?
that
is
the
fundamental
question
coming
that
if
I
do
not
take,
then
fine
I
do
not
lose
anything.
But
if
I
take,
I
gain
what?
that
I
should
know
before
had,
right.
So,
here
it
is
dairy
and
food
and
in
this
I
would
like
to
mention
here
itself,
that
normally
we
segregate
food
in
two
parts,
one
is
the
solid
or
semisolid
food,
another
is
the
liquid
or
semi
liquid
food,
right.
Obviously ,
both
cannot
be
under
the
same
umbrella,
like
if
many
of
your
friends
are
sitting
together
and
watching,
this
class,
then
it
cannot
be
thus
all
of
you
have
the
identical
shirt
or
pant
or
similar
kind
of
thing.
So,
that
it
fits
everybody
equally
or
into
the
same
extent
to
the
same
level
of
accuracy .
So,
in
that
case,
definitely
you
have
to
make
it
according
to
your
requirement,
according
to
your
choice,
according
to
your
liking.
All
these
will
dictate
which
shirt;
which
pant
you
will
wear ,
and
which
will
be
by
your
friends,
right.
So,
in
that
case,
we
can
say
that
we
divide
food
into
two
parts,
one
in
the
liquid
food
and
another
in
the
solid
food.
And
another
thing
which
is
also
in
the
course,
in
the
headline
itself;
means
course
or
topic
itself,
the
subject/topic
itself
it
is
there,
that
process
is
there
right.
So,
when
we
are
talking
about
process,
and
when
we
are
talking
about
products,
they
are
all
again
all
together
different.
Yes,
it
is
through
process
we
arrive
at
the
product,
right.
And
that
is
where
we
are,
then
in
the
question
comes,
why
should
we
do
the
processing?
If
we
do
not
do
the
processing
how
does
it
matter?
let
it
be
like
that.
I
will
give
a
small
example,
which
you
come
across
every
day,
right.
At
your
home,
you
ask
your
mother;
you
ask
your
parents
or
senior
people,
senior
persons
who
handles
it
every
day,
that
they
buy
milk
every
day.
More
or
less
every
houses
milk
is
one
of
the
product,
which
we
consume,
right;
now,
when
the
milkman
has
given
or
if
you
have
bought
from
the
market
pouches
whatever
now
nowadays
commercially
available.In
earlier
days
these
were
in
bottles,
do
with
with
the
advent
of
time
with
the
advent
of
technologies
things
are
getting
changed.
So,
there
was
when
bottles
where
there
some
good
things
where
there
similarly
bad
things
was
that
it
they
were
breakable
so,
handling
was
problem.
So,
the
manufacturer
then
changed
it
to
polythene.
Again,
someday
it
will
come
that
this
is
not
suitable
or
some
problem
or
natural
hazard
or
some
other .
So,
then
again
it
will
be
shifted
to
some
other ,
right.
It
is
changing
it
cannot
be
steady ,
that
universal
all
through
it
will
be
identical
if
there
cannot
be
such
kind
of
things.
Then
this
once
you
process
and
then
you
get
the
product;
that
means,
you
must
know
also
the
processing,
you
must
also
know
to
the
products,
right.
So,
until
and
unless
these
things
you
know ,
this
is
a
small
ambient
in
the
entire
domain
of
the
food,
right.
It
is
very,
very
small
part
in
the
entire
domain
of
food
in
one
subject
everything
cannot
be
taught,
in
the
earlier
classes
also
not
only
in
my
class,
I
am
referring
to
your
earlier
class
when
you
were
in
schools,
it
was
not
possible
that
all
the
things
may
be
yeah!
whether
it
is
English
or
Mathematics
or
Physics,
everything
would
be
told
in
one
year
or
one
class
if
like
that,
right.
So,
the
purpose
of
this
course
is
to
make
you
aware
that
what
you
should
consider
as
safe
product,
what
you
should
consider
as
palatable
product,
how
you
will
keep
these
products,
how
will
process
these
products?,
and
how
long
you
can
keep
it?
That
is
a
fundamental
question.
That’ s
how
long
I
can
keep
it?
I
gave
this
example
of
milk,
and
this
milk
if
they
were
not
processing
in
after
they
brought
it
is
from
the
market,
or
the
milk
man
supplied
since
there,
then
now
it
is
summer
in
many
process.
So,
typically
where
it
is
peak
summer ,
this
problem
is
more
severe
that
the
milk
gets
curdled
milk
gets
spoiled,
right.
In
spite
of
your
best
wishes,
you
could
not
manage
to
stop
that,
unless
you
have
taken
due
care
of
processing.
What
processing
did
you
do
there?
Or
did
they
do
there?
They
have
taken
it
to
a
pan
and
then
heated
it,
right.
And
it
is
not
that,
once
you
heat
and
that
is
for
all.
you
ask
your
mummy
that
once
she
has
boiled
it
in
the
morning
in
the
summer ,
peak
summer
if
it
is
not
kept
in
the
refrigerator
or
somewhere
in
cold
ambience,
then
in
the
night
if
it
is
peak
summer ,
I
am
again
referring;
that
means,
outside
temperature
is
very
high
may
be
40
or
45ºC
somewhere
it
goes
to
even
50
ºC.
So,
there
in
the
morning
it
was
boiled,
and
in
theevening
the
same
thing
may
happened
the
milk
might
have
gone
rotten
or
might
have
been
spoiled.
It
is
not
acceptable
for
your
consumption.
That
means,
it
is
not
that
you
have
processed
once,
and
that
is
for
that
is
once
processing
is
for
lifetime,
no.
So,
everything
has
certain
plus
or
certain
minus;
that
means,
some
insight
we
have
to
come
to
know ,
then
only
you
will
be
able
to
detect,
then
you
will
able
to
understand
what
kind
of
processing,
what
kind
of
things
we
will
be
doing,
right.
Since,
I
have
taken
this
typical
one,
as
I
was
told
that
the
students
should
come
to
know
that
why
should
they
take
the
course,
right.
Before
end
unless
you
are
your
compelled
to
take
the
course,
you
will
not,
but
if
you
love
the
course,
definitely
you
will
have
lot
of
interest
to
know
more
and
more,
right.
So,
to
create
that
interest
in
you,
I
take
this
class
as
the
platform,
where
I
tell
in
this
in
this
typical
course,
let
me
go
to
the
next.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:32)
You
have
seen
in
your
course
outline
when
you
registered;
obviously ,
you
have
seen.
So,
lot
of
things
and
some
basic
principles
were
told.
Some
basic
principles
are
there,
some
laws
are
also
there,
some
physical
or
chemical
changes
during
processing
or
structure
of
the
material,
how
they
are
that
is
also
there.
Then
why
we
as
I
said
that
milk
example,
why
it
got
spoiled,
right.
That
also
should
be
known,
otherwise
why
should
you
learn
that
if
you
cannot
tell
your
mummy ,
that
mummy
do
not
keep
it
outside
for
such
a
long
time,
right.
Do
not
keep
it
outside
for
such
a
long
time,
and
one
more
thing
I
tell
you
it
is
not
only
for
food,
right.
It
is
now
a
days
it
is
for
any
whether
it
is
prepared
food
or
you
brought
it
from
outside,
nowadays
lot
of
ready
to
eat
foods
are
available
all
over,
right.
Or
processed
foods
are
also
available
all
over,
but
any
food
it
is
recommended
that
this
heating
business
unless,
unless
it
is
not
to
be
heated
like
ice
cream
is
a
product
which
you
cannot
heat,
right.
It
has
to
be
consumed
in
the
cold
only,
because
if
you
heat
the
ice
cream
it
will
melt,
and
you
will
not
get
the,
you
may
get
a
little
taste.
You
will
not
get
also
because
ice
cream
as
it
is
cream
as
well
as
air
both
are
there,
right;
both
together .
So,
unless
you
have
both
together
you
do
not
enjoy
it,
you
do
not
get
the
feel
of
it.
So,
to
have
that
feeling,
you
have
to
have
in
the
cold
ice
cream.
So,
that
is
not
again
the
example
of
this
milk
we
are
coming
back.
That
what
are
the
microbial
changes,
what
are
the
things
which
are
responsible
for,
spoiling
the
milk,
which
mummy
had
boiled
in
the
morning.
But
in
the
evening
when
you
came
back
after
the
classes
after,
after
the
day’s
play
and
everything,
and
if
mummy
wanted
to
give
you
back
,
that
part
of
that
milk
she
saw;
that
it
got
spoiled.
So,
you
must
be
able
to
tell
her,
that
mummy
you
should
not
have
done
this
right.
So,
you
learn
a
lot
from
your
home
also,
it
is
not
home
science,
but
basic
science,
science
is,
right
from
your
home
and
whenever
you
are
able
to
convert
it
into
commercial
level,
then
it
comes
to
the
level
of
engineering.
So,
science
when
it
is
applied,
when
this
made
to
commercial
level,
then
it
comes
the
engineering,
because
then
you
have
to
tell,
because
mummy
had
done
it
in
a
small
pan
of
maybe
1
litre,
2
litre.
But
you
assume
you
see
that
you
have
become
a
owner
of
say
1
lakh
litre
of
milk
a
day.
Then
obviously ,
that
1
litre,
2
litre,
10
litre
pans
will
not
help
you.
Maybe
the
processes
is
same
that,
what
mummy
had
done;
you
will
also
be
doing.
However ,
you
need
to
know
now,
how
to
handle
such
a
huge
quantity
of
the
raw
milk
or
basic
liquid
milk
right.
Therefore,
these
things
we
must
be
aware
of
and
some
more
like
common
dairy
processes
like
separation
of
cream.
You
take
everyday
butter;
know
bread,
butter ,
jam,
jelly
and
marmalade
the
things
you
take.
Every
day
I
am
not
saying
everything
will
come
under
this
under
the
purview
ofthis
course,
but
as
a
preamble,
we
can
say
that
when
you
are
taking
jam,
jelly
and
marmalade
in
the
bread
as
well
you
are
taking
butter
in
the
bread.
Butter
is
a
milk
product
whereas,
jam,
jelly
they
are
not
milk
product,
right.
Milk
which
we
referred
that
was
spoiled
because
of
the
outside
temperature
being,
so
high
summer
peak
summer
right.
But
butter
you
do
not
keep
it
outside,
because
butter
at
room
temperature
it
is
solid,
but
if
the
room
temperature
means
around
20
to
30°C
,
if
it
is
beyond
that
then
it
is
start
melting,.
So,
it
loses
it
is
solidity
and
comes
to
liquid.
Then
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
keep
it.
So,
you
must
know
which
one
to
be
kept
where,
for
how
long
it
will
stay
etcetera.
So,
these
things
if
you
do
not
know
before,
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
the
commercial
processing
successful.
You
will
not
be
able
to
understand
how,
where
and
what
you
are
doing
right.
So,
this
course
will
help
you
to
understand
lot
of
both
microbiology ,
physical
science,
chemical
science
and
some
processing,
some
laws,
food
laws
by
which
because.
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
seen
you
are
aware
of
regular
I
mean
this
media.
Media
in
many
cases
many
places
it
is
being
shown
that
artificial
milk
is
also
being
prepared.
And
that
to
in
almost
in
the
very
high
scale
of
level,
right.
So,
those
milk
are
not
eatable
or
drinkable,
right.
Those
milk
are
not
drinkable,
it
should
not
be,
it
is
harder
in
some
big
big
stations
that
a
tea
which
have
been
served,
they
are
made
from
the
milk
which
has
no
quantity
not
a
single
drop
of
natural
milk,
entire
thing
is
manufactured.
So,
those
are
you
must
be
able
also
identify
and
tell
that
this
is
the
law
you
cannot
do
this,
right.
You
can
fool
people,
there
is
word
there
is
a
saying,
that
you
can
fool
all
the
people
once,
you
can
fool
some
people
for
many
times,
but
you
cannot
fool
all
the
people
all
the
time,
right.
So,
the
you
may
be
one
of
them
that
who
will
tell
no
you
are
not
suppose
to
do,
because
this
is
we
have
come
to
know
that
these
are
the
laws,
these
are
the
statutory
laws
where
you
will
come
to
know
that,
if
you
are
caught
if
you
are
found
to
do
such
unfair
means,
then
you
will
be
penalized,
you
may
be
sent
to
jail.
So,
these
things
you
must
know
and
then
you
must
understand,
you
must
know ,
then
only
you
can
convince
that
this
is
bad
and
that
is
good,
right.Some
process
technology
for
manufacturing
of
some
of
the
products
like
evaporated
milk
condensed
milk,
you
have
come
to
come
across
at
home
also
that
many
milk
products
every
now
and
then
milk
products
are
at
home
coming
every
other
day
you
may
have
some
or
other
kind
of
thing.
But
earlier
in
our
childhood
since
that
time
the
production
of
milk
might
not
have
been
so,
high
as
it
is,
right.
Kurien
Saheb
as
you
have
come
to
know
that
Kurien,
he
had
made
that
Gujarat
this
Amul
cooperative,
then
only
that
was
a
white
revolution,
right.
And
lot
of
milk
was
made
available
to
people
right,
but
yes
during
our
childhood
that
kind
of
milk
was
not
available,
and
market
milk
like
this
today
available
every
almost
in
every
other
shop.
So,
there
it
was
not
that
maybe
some
places
from
where
it
would
have
come;
you
have
to
go
and
stand
in
the
queue,
and
you
might
get
or
you
might
not
get
some
quantity .
So,
the
alternative
was
condensed
milk.
Still
we
remember
that
condensed
milk.
It
is
Yeah,
very
palatable
when
you
take
it,
but;
obviously ,
seniors
will
not
allow
you
to
take
just
directly ,
because
from
that
condensed
milk
you
can
make
normal
milk
in
a
bigger
way,
or
you
can
use
them
for
some
other
purpose,
right.
Some
dried
milk,
some
melted
milk,
some
infant
baby
food,
ice
cream
cheese
butter
fermented
milk,
indigenous
dairy
products,
these
are
some
of
the
products
which
we
will
be
dealing
in
this
course
also.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:13)
Then
we
will
also
look
into
some
methods,
a
procedures
that
how
you
will
be
sampling.
I
still
remember
that
when
I
was
in
commercial
industry;
say,
ice
cream
there
every
day
the
milk
used
to
come
in
big
big
tanks,
maybe
25
litres
or
50
litres
tank
capacity
from
different
parts,
right.
And
those
people,
I
was
of
course,
not
directly
in
the
associated
with
that.
But
those
who
were
in
the
in
the
in
the
quality
control
so,
they
used
to
attend
those,
and
they
have
to
decide
on
the
platform,
on
the
on
the
place
where
it
was
used
maybe
100s
of
the
such
tanks
have
come
and
they
have
to
tell
yes
these
are
all
or
some
of
them
are
bad.
Now ,
imagine
without
any
virtually ,
without
any
help
of
any
instruments,
is
it
possible
for
you
to
tell
yes
this
is
bad
that
is
good.
But
any
instrument
if
you
use
that
will
take
some
time,
but
you
have
to
decide
almost
within.
So,
when
they
are
coming
they
are
coming
in
bulk.
So,
100’s
of
cans
are
coming
in
line
and
you
have
to
decide
at
that
it
will
go
inside
to
the
industry ,
or
it
will
be
thrown
out
the
supplier
will
take
it
back
because
of
bad
milk.
So,
this
decision
those
quality
control
people
have
to
take
so,
how
to
do?
So,
there
must
be
some
with
those
are
called
platform
test.
So,
those
are
also
to
be
known,
then
some
technological
processes
for
industrial
manufacture
of
foods
of
commercial
importance
from
plant
and
animal
origin,
right.
May
be
subsequently
we
will
start
when
the
regular
course
after
the
preamble.
Then
we
will
see
that
as
I
said
we
divide
food
in
two
parts,
primarily
as
liquid
food
or
as
solid
food.
And
then
also
in
the
solid
food,
we
tell
either
it
is
from
animal
origin
or
from
the
plant
origin,
right.
So,
again
you
are
making
two
umbrellas;
One
from
plant
origin,
another
from
animal
origin.
So,
unless
you
know
them,
you
will
not
be
able
to
decide
what
to
do
or
not
to
do.
Then
out
of
the
plant
origin,
it
could
be
cereals,
pulses,
fruits
&vegetables
or
animal
origin
may
be
fish
meat
like
that,
right.
Then
once
you
are
with
all
these
materials,
then
the
it
comes
how
will
you
keep
it.
Yes,
at
home
mummy
has
kept
it
in
a
small
container
and
may
be
kept
in
the
refrigerator .
Nowadays
majority
of
the
people
do
have
refrigerator
at
home,
right.
Most
of
the
people
who
can
afford
of
course,
it
is
also
has
it
has
to
be
affordable.So,
those
who
can
afford
do
have
also
refrigerator .
So,
mummy
has
take
kept
it
in
the
refrigerator
in
a
small
quantity .
But
if
you
have
to
do
it
in
a
large
scale,
may
be
in
intense
of
thousands
of
kgs
or
litres,
then
how
to
store
them,
or
in
small
quantity
also
you
have
to
shift
it
from
your
place
you
have
the
processing
place
at
your
place
to
may
be
1000
kms
have
a
from
there,
how
to
keep
it?
How
to
send
it?
How
to
store
it?
So,
these
are
to
be
known.
So,
we
are
coming
to
packaging
material,
some
properties
of
the
packaging
material,
some
principles
for
filling
shorting
all
these
machines,
then
whether
it
is
gas
packaging
or
atmospheric
packaging.
All
these
will
come
up
and
definitely
will
take
care
in
the
due
course
of
the
proceeding
of
the
course,
right.
I
simply
request
you
that
please
make
sure
that
you
are
going
through
the
course
regularly ,
and
whatever
questions
you
will
have
you
will
be
free
to
ask
us
through
some
portal
that
will
be
given
to
you.
And
there
will
be
every
week
there
will
be
some
questionnaire
and
you
have
to
answer
them,
and
try
to
answer
them
yourself,
right.
Without
taking
the
help
of
books
and
other
helps
yourself
from
your
good
self
you
can
reply
them
then
obviously
that
becomes
good
thing
and
you
can
then
be
sure,
yes,
I
have
learnt
a
little,
ok;
so
hoping
you
all
the
best.
So,
let
us
conclude
our
preamble
today
here
itself,
next
class
onwards
we
will
be
proceeding
towards
the
main
course
of
this
subject.
Thank
you.
