Hygiene
and
Other
Contr ols
in
India
So,
we
finished
in
the
last
class
about
the
FPO
that
is
the
typical
food
product
controlling
agency
right?
So,
this
is
under
this
class
there
is
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology .
So,
we
are
now
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
also
other
factors
like
hygiene
one
of
the
major
factor
in
the
quality
control
or
laws
governing
the
food
laws.
So,
there
this
hygiene
and
many
other
factors
are
associated
directly
or
indirectly
to
benefit
the
consumer
in
terms
of
the
safety
and
security
of
the
product
developed
right?
So,
FPO
is
one
such
organization,
AGMARK
is
one
such
organization
who
are
given,
who
authority
to
certify
the
product,
to
certify
the
process,
to
certify
the
manufacturing
practice,
so
all
are
under
that
right?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:44)
So,
let
us
look
into
that
what
are
the
laid
down
norms
about
the
hygiene
right?
So,
in
order
to
maintain
hygienic
production
and
quality
standards,
FPO
that
is
Food
Products
Order
has
laid
down
following
minimum
requirements
what
are
they?
They
are
like
this;
location
and
surroundings
of
the
factory .1
Now
imagine
you
have
a
food
product
manufacturing
unit
in
some
locality ,
where
the
surrounding
is
so
obnoxious,
it
is
so
unhygienic,
that
lot
of
odd
materials
which
are
otherwise
very
bad,
they
are
associated
all
around.
Then;
obviously ,
may
be
directly
or
indirectly
it
will
affect
the
quality
of
the
finished
product
from
that
particular
industry .
So,
that
is
why
the
sanitary
and
hygienic
conditions
of
the
premises
are
very
important.
So,
that
is
what
the
minimum
requirement
laid
down
by
the
FPO.
Then
personal
hygiene;
the
people
who
are
working
in
there,
their
hygiene
also
has
directly
or
indirectly
affected.
Nowadays,
if
you
go
to
some
food
industries,
since
the
laws
have
become
or
standards
have
become
so,
stringent
that
you
will
see
that
most
of
the
people
who
are
handling,
who
are
directly
associated
with
the
production
line,
they
are
production
or
control
line.
So,
they
I
win
in
even
handling
also;
so
they
are
all
taking
the
personal
hygiene,
personal
care
such
that
the
contamination
or
any
kind
of
impurity
from
the
external
source
can
be
minimized.
So,
the
law
or
standard
has
to
encompass
the
personal
hygiene
of
the
people
work
working
right.
Portability
of
water;
this
is
again
a
major
drawback
of
our
system,
that
water
which
is
being
supplied
to
the
industry ,
that
the
industry
has
to
get
it
clarified
or
get
it
purified,
so
that
it
becomes
according
to
the
standard
or
it
becomes
portable.
Portable
water
should
be
given
to
the
industry
such
that,
the
main
focus
of
the
industry
is
not
getting
diverted
or
there
is
no
chance
of
getting
contaminated
or
getting
exploited
by
the
water
quality
into
the
product
being
developed.
So,
this
is;
these
are
the
factors
or
these
are
the
scenarios
which
again
in
the
beginning
we
said
policy
that
policy
makers;
they
should
look
into
that
the
water
supplied
to
the
company ,
industry
is
potable
water .
The
industry
whether
likes
or
does
not;
they
have
or
it
has
to
take
that
potable
water
and
use
that
potable
water ,
there
is
no
scope
that
the
water
will
not
be
portable.
So,
if
we
live
it
on
to
the
industry
in
majority
of
the
cases,
because
of
the
human
humanness
of
the
people
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
adhere
to.
So,
the
portability
if
it
is
not
there,
that
will
certainly
incur
some
or
other
kind
of
quality
deterioration
into
the
product
right?
Then
machinery
and
equipment,
with
installed
capacity;
in
many
cases
it
has
been
found
that
the
company
X
is
permitted
with
machine
buying
either
import
or
local,
whatever
it
be,
that
the
certification
or
permission
was
given
for
such
and
such
quantity
may
be
Y
kg
per
hour
right?
2And
the
capacity
of
the
machine
handling
this
has
to
be
minimum
Y
kg
per
hour,
but
in
many
cases
this
is
seen
that
this
is
less
than
Y
kg.
I
am
not
saying
in
all
the
cases
in
many
cases
or
some
cases
this
is
like
that.
So,
the
controlling
body
has
to
keep
eye,
has
to
keep
an
eye
that
the
machines
which
are
online,
which
are
handling,
which
are
manufacturing
the
product;
that
should
be
at
for
with
the
capacity
approved
or
specified
right?
Quality
control
and
facility
and
technical
staff;
again
in
typical,
in
particular ,
in
our
country ,
this
word
that
the
quality
control
facility
and
technical
staff;
this
in
most
of
the
cases
I
say
except
some
very
big
organizations
or
multi
or
those
are
multinationals.
I
am
not
saying
of
question
that
local
locals
are
also
not
doing;
many
of
them
might
be
doing,
but
it
is
also
true
many
of
them
do
not
have
any
quality
control
or
quality
assessment
space
or
places
and
the
required
equipped
or
knowledgeable
persons
who
are
handling
them.
In
most
of
the
cases,
it
is
seen;
if
requirement
is
food
technologist,
then
this
is
being
done
by
the
maybe
some
chemist
or
maybe
some
even
lower
graded
people.
And
who
do
not
have
that
much
vision
about
the
both
quality
as
well
as
the
impact
of
the
laws.
So,
this
is
another
week
point
of
the
in
the
in
our
country
typically;
industry
level
that,
how
the
quality
is
being
assessed
or
is
being
controlled
by
the
people
associated
with
them
right.
In
majority
of
the
cases,
the
people
concerned
are
not
up
to
the
standard
or
up
to
the
desired
level
of
knowledgeable;
so
this
is
another
weakness.
Product
standards;
now
product
standards;
obviously ,
the
company
who
is
manufacturing
the
product
will
claim
that
the
standard
is
such
and
such.
Now
this
FPO
as
we
said
is
one
such
organization
will
certify
that
yes;
the
company
which
has
given.
And
the
standard
of
the
product
is
claimed
by
the
company
and
certified
by
this
FPO
or
similar
kind
of
agencies
like
AGMARK
etcetera
right.
Then
limits
for
preservatives
and
other
additives.
In
many
case
as
I
we
said;
the
personnel;
who
are
handling
or
controlling
the
quality ,
then
in
means
if
they
are
not
at
par
with
the
requirement
with
that
with
the
standard,
with
the
required
qualification,
then
what
will
happen?
We
will
not
understand
he
or
she
will
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
limit
of
the
preservatives
right?
Limit
of
the
preservative
how
much
is
test
be
a
preservative
as
the
other
day
we
said
say
sodium
benzoate.
So,
how
much
sodium
benzoate
has
to
be
given?
What
is
the;
what
is
the
standard?
What
is
the
accessible
limit?
What
is
the
approved
limit?
If
this
is
not
known,
then
how
the
person
will
control?
How
the
person
will
manufacture
the
standard
quality?3Because
it
is
also
not
advisable,
though
if
the
preservative
is
at
par
with
the
approve
standard
that
can
be
used
as
much
as
I
wish
or
the
processor
wishes;
this
is
based
on
the
standard
laid
down
by
the
controlling
agencies
and
that
cannot
violate
that
quantity .
If
it
is
200
ppm
cannot
be
more
than
200
ppm;
if
it
is
20
ppm
cannot
be
more
than
20
pmm
right.
If
it
is
lower
than
that
nothing
like
that
right
and
by
the
by
as
earlier
we
have
come
across
that
may
be
jam
jelly
marmalade
came
into
as
fruits
and
vegetables
product
right
as
such
jam
jellying
marmalades
they
are
high
sugar;
high
sugar
or
high
acid
food
right?
So,
high
sugar ,
high
acid
food
it
itself
is
acts
itself
acts
as
preservative
right?
There
is
as
such
no
need
for
addition
of
any
preservative,
but
again
it
is
not
only
the
responsibility
of
the
manufacturer
or
the
standard
making
agencies;
it
is
also
responsibility
of
the
consumer ,
how
consumer
is
handling
that?
If
you
just
keep
your
eye
open
you
will
see,
that
those
bottles
of
jam
jelly
or
marmalade
or
things
like
that.
When
they
are
opened
and
handled
in
mass;
typically
in
mess
or
in
hostels
and
in
big
places
like
that
much
community
much
people
who
are
handling
it,
you
will
see
that
they
are
not
properly
handled.
Now
if
they
are
not
properly
handled
if
somebody
is
using
with
a
spoon,
having
some
water
and
that
water
is
going
into
this,
then
there
will
be
some
local
extra
additional
water
available.
So;
obviously ,
the
basic
principle
will
be
lost
and
that
may
become
vulnerable
for
the
organisms
to
invent
and
spoil
or
degrade
the
product.
So,
this
is
also
the
consumer
who
has
to
understand;
who
has
it
is
not
only
the
responsibility
of
the
law
making
people
or
implementing
people
or
the
producer .
It
is
also
consumer ,
who
has
also
to
know
and
who
was
also
to
avoid
by
certain
rules
and
regulations
right.
I
gave
the
right
example
that,
when
it
is
in
mass
scale
being
used
that
jam
jelly
marmalade
those
containers;
some
people
are
reusing
which
some
spoon,
which
has
lot
of
moisture
and
that
moisture
is
going
into
the
product
and
intern
is
affecting
the
quality .
So,
who
is
responsible
for
that?
Is
it
that
manufacturer
or
is
it
the
controlling
body?
It
is
also
the
consumer
who
has
to
come
for
or
so
he
has
to
be
educated.
So,
limit
for
this
preservation
and
other
additives
that
also
has
to
be
known
both
to
the
manufacturer
in
this
we
are
talking;
we
are
talking
about
the
implementing
agencies,
law
implementing
agencies
like
FPO.
So,
there
people
must
be
knowing
it,
as
well
the
producer
there
people
must
be
knowing
in;
as
well
I
also
appeal
that
the
consumer
also
should
keep
in
mind
that
has
to
be
handled,
that
4has
to
be
taken
in
the
right
way;
such
that
it
does
not
unnecessarily
introduced
some
or
other
source
of
getting
contamination
or
getting
infected
or
becoming
proven
to
be
infected
right?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:23)
So,
if
that
be
true,
then
let
us
look
into
that
FPO
what
are
the
food
products
other
than
those?
Non
fruit
beverages,
syrups
and
servers,
then
vinegar ,
whether
brewed
or
non
fruit;
whatever
be,
pickles,
dehydrated
fruits
and
vegetables
squashes,
crushes,
cordials,
barley
water ,
barreled
juice
and
ready
to
serve
beverages,
fruit
nectars
again
the
nectars
right?
Fruit
nectars
or
any
other
be
beverages
containing
fruit
juices
or
fruit
pulp.
Now
in
many
countries,
it
may
be
that
fruit
juice
meaning
absolutely
fruit
juice;
pure
fruit
juice
nothing
else
is
there,
but
nectar
is
such
a
thing,
where
it
allows
it
permits
to
add
required
quantity
of
may
be
water
right?
Required
quantity
of
other
materials
mostly
water;
so
some
dilution
is
also
possible
in
nectars.
So,
the
moment
you
are
adding
externally ,
then
it
becomes
your
responsibility .
Because
the
manufacture
has
manufacturer
has
given
you
the
according
to
the
mandate,
according
to
the
guide,
according
to
the
laws,
according
to
the
order ,
according
to
the
act
it
is
given.
But
you
being
the
consumer ,
you
being
the
ultimate
user,
you
also
do
have
responsibilities
that
are
we
should
maintain
according
to
the,
that
is
why
in
earlier
class
we
said
that
awareness
program
or
the
awareness
of
the
laws
and
its
implementation
or
if
it
is
not
what
are
5
the
losses,
what
are
the
other
things
which
may
be
phased
that
should
be
discussed
or
there
should
be
known
right?
So,
other
than
these
jams
jelly
and
marmalades
that
also
come
under
it.
Tomato
products,
ketchup,
sauces,
they
also
come
under
it.
Preserves
candied
and
crystallized
fruit
and
peel;
these
now
preserves
this
mean
that
things
which
are
kept
for
extended
life;
that
is
what
is
the
preserve.
That
the
thing
which
is
kept
for
extended
life
maybe
some
preservative
is
added
to
it,
but
the
whole
thing
is
called
preserve.
Candied
and
crystallized
most
of
the
candies
are
crystallized
right?
And
fruit
peel
in
many
cases
like
in
marmalade;
marmalade
fruit
peel
is
used.
For
example,
orange
peel;
orange
peel
is
used
for
marmalade.
So,
and
that
is
called
orange
marmalade
and
there,
this
peel
when
it
is
being
prepared;
the
way
it
is
being
prepared,
the
way
it
is
preserved;
so
all
these
must
be
act
in
accordance
with
the
laws
in
accordance
with
the
guidelines
framed
by
these
organizations
like
FPO
right?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
21:15)
Then
other
products
which
come
under
the
umbrella
of
this
FPO
are
chutneys,
canned
and
bottled
fruit
juice,
pulps,
canned
and
bottled
vegetables,
frozen
fruits
and
vegetables,
sweetened
aerated

and
without

juice
or
fruit
pulp,
fruit
cereal
flakes,
all
unspecified
fruit
and

products,
which
are
considered
microbiologically
safe
and
contains
only
permitted
additives
within

So,
these
all
come
under
the
FPO
under
the
umbrella
of
FPO;
Food
Products
Order
right?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:07)
Now ,
each
container
in
which
any
fruit
product
is
packed
shall
specify
a
code
number ,
indicating
the
lot
or
the
date
of
manufacture
of
such
fruit
product.
As
we
said
this
I
just
showed
you.
So,
here
you
see
that,
this
product
is
having
the
date
of
manufacture,
some
number ,
lot
number ,
batch
number ,
data
of
manufacture.
And
nowadays
it
is
mandatory
that
it
is;
if
it
is
a
sealed
product,
then
there
must
be
also
the
date
of
expiry .
The
date
of
expiry
is
must
if
it
is
sealed
product
right;
so,
I
just
showed
you
one
product,
just
available
in
canteen.
So,
from
there
I
brought
it
and
yes
there
it
is
the
data
of
manufacturer ,
that
thus
the
permit
permitting
or
authorizing
agency
that
is
also
the
name
is
there
or
certifying
agency
that
name
is
also
there.
So,
these
things
are
part
of
the
whole.
No
person
can
carry
on
the
business
of
a
manufacturer
except
under
and
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
an
effective
license
granted
to
him
under
the
order
of
FPO.
In
form
B
and
shall
not
use
the
license
number
on
labels
of
non-fruit
products.
So,
you
have
a
license
of
food
products;
may
be
short
some
other
thing;
that
is
the
that
is
supposed
to
be
made
of
the
fruit,
but
if
you
are
doing
a
non-fruit
and
using
the
same
license,
that
is
not
permitted,
that
is
not
acceptable.
7
So,
that
is
against
the
law;
against
the
order ,
so
that
should
be
kept
in
mind.
FPO
mark
should
be
printed
on
the
level
with
license
number .
The
labels
shall
not
contain
any
statement,
claim,
design
or
device,
which
is
false
or
misleading
in
any
particular
concerning
the
fruit
products;
contained
in
the
package
or
concerning
the
quantity
or
the
nutritive
value
or
in
relation
to
the
place
of
origin
of
the
said
food
product
right.
So,
this
things
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
whichever
is
the
entrepreneur
that;
if
suppose
a
product
is
being
manufactured
at
a
place
A;
of
a
of
our
country
and
when
it
is
going
to
be
sold
in
a
place
like
B,
for
some
more
other
reason,
A
and
B
are
not
in
good
humor ,
then
unnecessarily
the
product
will
suffer
for
some
more
other
reason
from
the
place
it
was
manufactured
date,
to
the
place
being
consumed
at
B.
To
avoid
that
this
has
become
a
mandatory
that
the
where
it
is
being
manufactured,
there
should
not
be
a
part
of
it
right
a
misleading.
That
as
falls
or
misleading
in
any
particular
concerning
the
fruit
products,
contained
in
the
package
or
concerning
the
quantity
or
the
nutritive
value
or
in
relation
to
the
place
of
origin
of
the
same
fruit
products
right.
So,
this
should
not
contain
in
the
manufacture
in
the
shell
in
the
container
right?

MFPO,
1973,
the
objective
was
to
regulate
production
and
sale
of
meat
food
products
through
licensing
of
manufacturers.
Enforce
sanitary

at
all
stages
of
production
of
meat
food
products
fish

And
the
danger
is
that
if
the
MFPO
is
not
implemented,
then
the
danger
is
that
the
meat
and
meat
products
bring
highly
perishable
in
nature.
And
can
transmit
diseases
from
animals

this
if
it
is
not
adhere
to,
if
the
laws
and
orders
are
not
adhere
to;
then
the
contamination
from
the
annual
to
the
human

chance
is
very
high;
so,
that
is
that
danger
part.
Some
exclusions
are
there
definitely;
if
it
is
being
consumed
in

etcetera
then
this
can
be
excluded.
The
reason

they
are
supposed
to
take
care
lot
of
care
such
that
this
kind
of
contamination
is
