Whey
Protein
(Contd.)
So,
we
were
discussing
about
the
Whey
Protein
and
because
of
the
time
constraint,
we
had
to
stop
at
beta
lactoglobulin
or
beta
lactalbumin
right.
And
let
us
look
into
its
continuity .
That,
this
was
that
higher
concentrations
of
beta
lactoglobulin
are
present
in
bovine
milk
compared
to
that
in
human
milk
right.
Now ,
some
more
are
there
about
the
beta
lactoglobulin;
that
beta
lactoglobulin
is
better
in
terms
of
heat
stability
than
that
of
the
alpha
lactoglobulin
due
to
the
presence
of
free
sulphhydryl
unit
right.
Free
sulphhydryl
unit
is
there
because
of
that
it
is
better
in
terms
of
heat
stability
than
that
of
the
alpha
lactoglobulin.
It
contains
open
beta
barrel
enclosing
a
hydrophobic
cleft,
and
a
single
three
turn
alpha
helix,
it
also
binds
to
several
hydrophobic
molecules
including
retinol
and
retinol
rather
and
fatty
acids
via
the
hydrophobic
acid,
with
via
the
hydrophobic
acid
cleft
which
in
turn
stimulates
lipase
activity
right.
So,
these
are
the
sum
of
the
reasons
we
come
across,
why
dif ferent
proteins
when
present
in
milk,
they
are
subjected
to
dif ferent
enzymes
when
we
will
come
to
enzyme
also,
that
time
you
will
see
that
how
dif ferent
types
of
enzymes
are
present
in
milk
and
what
actions
they
are
causing
or
producing
right.
However ,
it
is
here
we
see
that,
it
binds
to
that
beta
lactoglobulin
binds
to
several
hydrophobic
molecules,
including
retinol
retinol
and
fatty
acids
via
hydrophobic
cleft,
which
in
turn
stimulates
lipase
activity
right.
So,
the
moment
lipase
activity
is
there
or
it
stimulates
lipase
activity ,
which
intern
acts
on
the
lipe
lipids
right
lipase
is
the
enzyme
acting
on
the
lipid
right.
So,
other
whey
proteins
are
like
immunoglobulin;
immunoglobulin
right
from
the
word
immune.
So,
it
appears
that,
some
immunity
or
things
like
that
is
associated
right.
It
is
true
that
it
is
associated
with
both
antibodies
that
are
synthesized
in
response
to
specific
antigen.
So,
antigen
antibodies
these
are
associated
with
immunization
or
immunity
of
the;
I
don’ t
say
living
unit,
I
don’ t
say
only
bovine
or
mammals.
It
is
true
for
all
living
units
and
this
immunoglobulin
typically
is
associated
with
the
antibody
and
antigen
these
things
right.
Antigen
antibodies
are
I
mean
these
are
I
don’ t
say
mirror
image,
but
they
are
like
I
mean
as
close
as
they
are
which
one
is
there
the
other
also
will
be
there
right.
So,
antigen
antibody
these
are
now
what
is
that
antibody?
Antibodies
also
called
immunoglobulins;
antibodies
also
called
sorry
immunoglobulins
and
also
called
immunoglobulins
and
there
are
y
shaped
molecules
are
proteins
manufactured
by
the
body ,
that
help
fight
against
foreign
substances
called
antigens.
So,
the
moment
antigen
has
taken
place
the
immediately
body
mechanism
tries
to
develop
antibody
to
that
antigen
right
and
this
antigen
is
the
source
of
the
infection.
So,
antigens
are
any
substance
that
stimulates
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
right.
Antigens
can
be
bacteria,
virus,
fungi
that
causes
the
infection
and
diseases
in
the
body
system.
So,
when
this
antigen
is
there,
it
is
triggering
simultaneously
to
produce
the
antibodies
to
fight
against
the
antigen
right.
So,
immunoglobulins
are
lar ge
heterogeneous
molecules
found
in
blood,
the
main
immunoglobulins
in
milk
are.
The
main
immunoglobulins
in
milk
are
IgG
right
IgG
or
Ig2
IgA
and
IgM.
So,
main
immuno
globulins
are
IgG
Ig2
IgA
and
IgM.
Out
of
which
this
immunoglobulin
g
that
is
the
IgG,
the
most
abundant
type
of
antibody
and
is
found
in
all
body
fluids
accept
in
all
body
fluids
and
protects
against
bacterial
and
viral
infections
right.
It
protects
against
bacterial
and
viral
infections
and
this
is
present
in
all
body
fluids
right
whatever
body
fluid
we
have,
it
is
not
only
the
blood
which
is
the
body
only
having
right.
So,
body
fluids
are
also
there.
So,
there
it
is
all
IgG
or
immunoglobulin
G
and
it
is
abundant
and
type
of
antibody
present
in
the
body
and
present
throughout
the
fluid
of
the
body .
Now
another
one
is
immunoglobulin
M
or
IgM
which
is
found
mainly
in
the
blood
and
the
lymph,
which
is
found
mainly
in
the
blood
and
the
lymph
and
is
the
first
antibody
to
be
made
by
the
body
to
fight
in
new
infection.
So,
the
first
antibody
which
is
produced
by
the
body
to
fight
against
the
infection
which
has
come
up;
so,
there
is
the
IgM.
And
this
again
if
you
have
seen
if
you
have
come
across
with
the
blood
test
of
your
parents
or
seniors,
then
you
might
have
seen
some
of
them
might
have
been
advised
by
the
doctors
to
under go
the
test
like
IgG
IgM
etcetera
right.
So
that
means,
how
good
is
the
antibody ,
how
good
is
the
protective
mechanism
of
the
body
that
is
to
be
understood
or
that
is
to
be
tested.
So,
thats
why
those
tests
are
given.
So,
here
also
we
see
this
antibody
IgM,
that
is
the
first
antibody
which
is
developed
by
the
body
to
protect
against
the
newly
invent
invaded
the
infection
right.
Then
immunoglobulins
provide
of fspring
with
protection
against
pathogens
and
their
toxin
and
the
memory
gland
against
infection
right.
Many
times
or
subsequently
also
perhaps
will
come
across,
that
there
are
some
diseases
which
are
also
infecting
on
the
mammary
gland
as
well
the
tip
so
that
the
milk
which
is
being
milked
or
which
is
being
extracted
from
the
animal
or
mammalian,
that
could
be
infected
right.
So,
this
is
a
very
bad
situation
if
by
chance
that
kind
of
infection
happens.
So,
it
provides
of fspring
that
is
number
of
next
generation
with
protection
against
pathogens
and
toxins
and
the
mammary
gland
against
infection.
.
In
bovine
milk
approximately
0.7
to
1
milligram
per
liter ,
0.7
to
1
milligram
per
liter
is
present
this
is
in
bovine
milk
right.
So,
this
immunoglobulin
is
around
0.7
to
1
milligram
per
milliliter
present
in
bovine
milk
structural
unit
of
immunoglobulins
are
similar .
So,
immunoglobulins
here
we
said
IgG,
IgM,
Ig2
IgA.
So,
there
structural
similarity
they
have
structural
similarity .
So,
if
one
structure
is
remembered
may
be
others
are
very
close
and
that
similarity
you
can
draw
and
also
you
can
identify
or
tell
right.
So,
all
immunoglobulins
they
have
structural
similarity
right.Now ,
two
heavy
and
two
light
chains
are
joined
together .
Heavy
and
light
means
big
amino
acid
chains
or
small
amino
acid
chains
that
is
what
it
is
meant;
that
two
heavy
and
two
light
chains
are
joint
together
by
disulphide
bond
right
that
is
sorry
that
is
disulfide
bonds
two
heavy
and
two
light
chains
are
there.
So,
that
is
disulphide
bond.
So,
one
S
one
S.
So,
this
and
this
can
react
or
this
can
be
linked
or
joint
right
So,
two
heavy
and
two
light
chains
are
joined
together
to
for
by
the
by
the
disulphide
bond.
So,
IgG
is
the
main
immunoglobulin
and
milk;
IgG
is
the
main
immunoglobulin
in
milk
and
then
another
protein
called
serum
albumin.
I
hope
this
serum
we
have
defined
earlier
and
not
going
to
repeat.
Serum
albumin
there
are
582
numbers
of
amino
acids,
582
numbers
of
amino
acids
and
longest
protein
because
you
see
so,
many
numbers
of
till
now
we
have
seen
100
150
around
things.
Now ,
here
it
is
582
almost
600;
so
3
to
4
times.
So,
those
when
you
so,
it
is
the
longest
protein
that
serum
albumin
is
the
longest
protein,
approximately
around
66
kilo
Dalton
is
the
molecular
is
the
molecular
mass
right
66
kilo
Dalton.
Alpha
helix
is
predominant,
alpha
helix
is
predominant
and
it
is
1
to
5
percent
of
the
total
whey
protein
right.
This
serum
albumin
is
1
to
5
percent
of
the
total
whey
protein
that
depends
on
like
earlier
also
we
have
said
that
the
type
of
breed
or
place
or
feed
or
many
many
causes
are
there
for
which
this
can
be
bearing
between
1
to
7
or
5.
Synthesize
this
is
this
serum
albumin
is
synthesized
in
the
liver
and
enters
the
milk
via
secretary
cells.
So,
there
are
secretary
cells
right
there
are
secretary
cells.
And
these
secretary
cells
are
allowing
the
synthesized
serum
albumin
and
enters
into
the
bloodstream
right.
Synthesized
in
the
liver
and
enters
the
milk
via
the
secondary
cells
right.
Then
other
proteins
like
protee
proteose
and
peptones
right
again
from
the
word,
protein
it
is
sounding
similar
that
proteose
and
peptones,
they
are
derived
from
the
hydrolysis
of
beta
casein.
W e
have
seen
alpha
s
1
alpha
s
2
beta
and
gamma
caseins
are
there.
So,
here
it
is
alpha
and
from
the
beta
casein
by
the
hydrolysis,
this
proteose
and
peptones
are
prepared
right
or
it
is
synthesized.
But
considered,
but
considered
whey
proteins
this
is
also
considered
as
whey
protein.
Though
it
is
made
from
beta
casein,
but
still
hydrolysis
of
beta
casein
still
it
is
in
the
family
of
whey
protein
not
in
the
family
of
casein
right
because
it
elutes
because
it
elutes
in
the
whey
fraction
when
isolated
from
milk
right.
So,
elutes
means
extracted
it
elutes
it
right
extracted
from
some
as
absorb
things
come
out.
So,
they
are
call
elute
right.
So,
it
elutes
in
whey
protein
a
whey
fraction,
when
isolated
from
milk
right.
So,
it
is
heat
stable
and
acid
soluble
protein
heats
stable
and
acid
soluble
both
are
there.
So,
these
proteose
peptones
are
heat
stable
as
well
the
acid
whenever
it
is
being
put
in
acid.
So,
it
is
acid
soluble
proteins.
Responsible
for
foaming
of
milk
that
foam
when
it
comes
I
do
not
know
how
many
of
you
have
seen
that
during
the
milking
time,
the
there
is
a
lot
of
foam
which
is
which
is
generated
right
and
you
are
you
are
normally
advised
don’ t
take
the
first
milk
or
may
be
the
last
milk.Because
the
moment
you
take
the
first
milk,
then
this
can
up
systematic
standardization
or
this
type
of
systemization
has
not
taken
place.
Whereas,
the
moment
you
got
the
moment
you
got
that
high
acid
soluble
and
heat
stable
proteins,
which
are
responsible
for
the
foaming
of
the
milk.
So,
foaming
of
milk
is
the
responsible
for
this,
this
one
is
and
it
inhibits
rancidity
right.
If
there
is
some
fat
so,
that
can
be
that
fat
can
be
hydrolyzed
rancid
it
can
be
it
can
be
rancid,
but
this
prevents
or
inhibits
the
rancidity
who
that
protoese
peptones
these
proteins
right
and
it
has
an
immuno
immunological
role.
So,
that
means,
some
immunity
concerned
things
are
associated
with
this
proteose
and
peptones.
Some
more
information
hopefully
we
can
share
and
that
is
that
proteose
is
what?
Is
any
of
various
water
soluble
compounds,
that
are
produced
during
digestion
by
the
by
the
hydraulic
breakdown
by
the
hydraulic
hydrolytic
breakdown
not
hydraulic
hydrolytic
breakdown
of
protein
short
of
the
amino
acid
stage
right
proteins
short
of
amino
acid
stage.
That
is
the
proteins
are
not
so
big,
not
to
the
extent
that
it
is
broken
to
the
to
the
amino
acids
basic
units.
But
not
very
far
away
from
the
amino
acid
stage
somewhere
in
between,
but
not
definitely
the
one
which
we
had
been
talking
about
right.
So,
it
is
the
proteose
is
any
of
various
water
soluble
compounds
that
are
produced
during
digestion
by
the
hydrolytic
breakdown
of
proteins
right
that
protein
short
of
the
amino
acid
stage
right.
So,
the
other
one
is
the
peptone,
which
is
soluble
protein
found
in
the
early
stage
of
protein
breakdown;
during
the
digestion
early
stage
of
protein
breakdown
this
is
soluble
protein
right
formed
in
the
stage
of
protein
breakdown
during
digestion.
Then
peptide;
peptidic
bond
or
peptide
bonds
this
you
have
heard
many
times
right
here
also
in
some
other
cases
also.
So,
here
what
is
that?
Peptide
is
composed
of
or
consist
the
peptide
is
the
compound
consisting
of
two
or
more
amino
acids,
linked
in
a
chain
the
carboxyl
group
of
each
acid
being
pointed
being
joined
to
the
amino
acid
may
amino
group
of
the
next
by
a
bond
by
a
bond
and
this
bond
is
of
the
type
OC
NH
right.
This
bond
is
of
the
type
called
OC
NC
NH
right.
So,
this
is
the
one
that
peptide
does.
Basic
definition
is
similar
all
pepti
pepta
proteose
peptone
and
peptide
the
definition
wise
their
similar ,
but
peptone
which
is
the
soluble
protein
formed
in
the
easily
formed
in
the
early
stage
of
protein
breakdown
during
digestion.
So,
during
digestion
at
the
early
breakdown
because
that
helps
to
digest
the
material
and
it
is
that
basic
definition
of
is
similar
peptone
soluble
protein
formed
in
the
early
stage
of
protein
breakdown
during
digestion.
And
pepsin
converse
proteins
to
peptones.
Pepsin
converts
proteins
to
peptones
right
and
what
is
that
peptone
here
we
have
seen?
Soluble
protein
formed
in
the
easy
in
the
early
stage
of
protein
breakdown
during
digestion
right.
So,
this
proteose
and
peptides
when
it
comes
it
is
peptide
has
a
dif ferent
definition,
but
it
can
be
applied
to
the
other
two
other
two
as
the,
but
it
can
be
applied
to
the
other
two
as
all
are
degraded
proteins,
but
not
amino
acids.
Of
course,
because
proteins
are
made
of
amino
acids,
and
amino
acids
are
consisting
many
amino
acids
which
are
connected
and
they
are
forming
some
proteins
right.
So,
if
we
see
that
the
peptones
or
proteose
and
peptides
all
are
pepsin
convert
right
and
during
and
during
the
digestion
this
conversion
happens.
That
pepsin
converse
protein
peptones
and
proteose
right
into
peptides.
So,
then
come.
So,
what
is
that
peptide
is
now
the
peptide
has
a
dif ferent
definition.
But,
it
can
be
applied
to
other
two
as
are
degraded
proteose,
but
are
not
amino
acids
as
these
are
degraded
proteins,
but
not
amino
acids,
because
amino
acids
are
the
simplest
or
smallest
unit
right.
So,
it
could
be
that
it
is
got
degraded
during
the
processing
whatever
be
the
thing
process,
but
it
could
have
been
degraded,
but
not
the
amino
acids
because
they
have
altogether
dif ferent
conversation
and
they
have
the
degraded.
So,
it
is
that
the
proteins
are
not
amino
acids
degraded
proteins
are
there,
and
amino
acid
being
the
simplest
or
smallest
unit
that
cannot
be
degraded
further .Thank
you.
