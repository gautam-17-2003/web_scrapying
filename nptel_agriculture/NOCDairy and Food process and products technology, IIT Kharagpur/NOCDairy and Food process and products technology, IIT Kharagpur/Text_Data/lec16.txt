Physico-Chemical
Properties
of
Milk
So,
we
have
done
these
laws
governing
the
food
and
food
items,
right.
W e
said
that
in
our
country
there
are
many
many
bodies
which
have
come
up,
one
of
the
apex
body
was
a
FSSAI,
you
remember
and
any
sub
bodies
like
your
that
milk
for
many
other
products,
the
BIS,
then
Agmark.
So,
all
these
came
up
and
we
discussed
about
there.
So,
all
the
time
whenever
you
are
doing
something
in
the
processing
or
product
development
or
you
are
bringing
some
new
technologies,
then
all
the
time
we
have
to
keep
all
these
laws
in
mind.
So,
that
both
the
processors
as
well
the
consumer;
primarily
the
consumer
is
benefited
because
whatever
you
do
is
primarily
for
the
consumer .
Because
if
there
is
no
taker ,
no
consumption
then
no
point
whatever
you
do,
whatever
best
you
do.
So,
that
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
right.
So,
after
the
laws
governing
the
food
area
arena
of
food;
we
now
come
to
that
okay
as
I
said
earlier
also
that
in
one
class
in
one
course
it
is
just
not
possible
to
cover
everything
right.
But
even
then
we
said
as
and
when
we
come
across
we
would
try
to
cover
of
them.
But
for
your
understanding
or
and
for
your
information
in
this
under
this
umbrella
of
NPTEL,
there
we
floated
one
course
earlier
that
was
very
very
helpful
for
fluid
flow
in
food
processing
and
preservation.
Fluid
flow
that
was
done,
in
future
maybe
we
also
will
be
doing
heat
transfer
or
thermal
as
well
as
the
mass
transfer .
So,
this
three
basic
engineering
that
is
fluid
flow ,
heat
transfer
and
mass
transfer ,
if
they
are
not
taken
as
a
course,
then
it
becomes
dif ficult
for
the
students
to
follow
up
everything.
And
because
you
know
those
are
the
three
pillars
on
which
the
entire
engineering
is,
I
am
not
saying
that
only
three
pillars,
but
mainly
these
three
pillars
are
sustaining
the
entire
gamut
of
the
food
process
and
preservation
industry .
So,
we
have
to
be
very
very
thorough
in
that
and
if
you
have
not
taken
up
earlier
that
at
least
fluid
flow
course
you
can
ask
for
and
register
as
well
and
do
as
a
whenever
you
want.
Obviously ,
I
don’ t
know
that
may
be
some
requirements
by
this
our
NPTEL
authorities
thatminimum
so
many
numbers
of
students
are
required
for
to
float
already
floated
one
course
like
that.
So,
if
you
demand
hopefully
they
can
also
bring
forward
the
old
things.
Of
course,
you
can
also
do
for
new
things
like
this
one
and
subsequent
things
which
will
be
coming
up
in
the
food
process
and
preservation
and
both.
So,
there
it
will
be
very
very
helpful
ok.
Now ,
you
proceed
to
the
fluid
we
said
that
this
is
the
course
and
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology
right.
So,
this
is
primarily
a
process
and
product
technology ,
but
we
are
trying
to
encompass
as
much
as
we
can
depending
on
our
time
frame
whatever
is
given
to
us.
So,
with
now
come
to
this
perhaps
today
you
should
be
the
lecture
16
and
this
will
encompass
on
physico
chemical
properties
of
milk.
Why
we
have
taken
milk?
Because
in
dairy
typically
milk
is
the
primary
product
right,
because
based
on
milk
subsequent
things
have
come
up.
So,
if
you
understand
milk
then
you
are
understanding
a
major
part
of
the
diary
side.
So,
this
is
one
side
another
side
is
since
milk
is
a
fluid
liquid.
So,
we
also
can
take
this
into
consideration
that
any
liquid
food
that
could
be
similar
to
milk
or
may
be
away
from
milk,
but
liquid.
So,
that
also
can
have
a
similar
ef fect,
similar
principle
of
thing
may
not
be
the
science
means
definitely
the
constitution
of
milk
and
another
product
say
sub
drink,
say
fruit
juice
they
cannot
be
identical,
but
the
basic
thing
is
that
they
are
also
fluid.
So,
that
both
as
I
said
a
mass
transfer ,
fluid
flow ,
a
heat
transfer ,
they
could
be
similar
right.
So,
you
can
you
can
you
can
imagine
you
can
deduce
you
can
think
you
can
develop
dif ferent
models
dif ferent
techniques
to
solve
the
problems,
but
the
science
part
is
of
course,
dif ferent
because
the
basic
constitution
of
the
individual
things
are
quite
dif ferent.
So
we
start
with
milk
as
the
liquid
food
and
part
of
the
diary
right,
so
that
the
first
thing
which
comes
in
your
mind
is
that.
What
is
milk?
Right.
So,
by
definition
of
raw
milk
this
is
defined
as
the
lacteal
secretion
practically
free
from
colostrum
obtained
by
the
complete
milking
of
healthy
cow ,
look
in
this
is
a
all
the
words
in
definition
number
1
it
is
the
lacteal
secretion
right.
Subsequently
when
we
define
again
some
other
then
you
will
see
or
we
extend
the
what
is
milk?
T o
understand
that
so
you
will
see
that
this
is
the
lacteal
secretion
means
this
has
to
be
a
mammalian
product
right.Other
than
mammalian
no
other
species
can
produce
milk
only
the
mammalian
can
produce
milk
right,
have
you
ever
seen
the
chicken
is
producing
milk
no
because
it’ s
not
mammalian.
So,
those
which
are
under
mammalian
category
they
only
can
produce
milk
right.
So,
from
the
definition
that
the
lacteal
secretion
practically
free
from
colostrum
though
we
will
come
again
colostrum
after
words,
but
since
it
has
come
here
let
us
also
say
colostrum
is
such
a
unique
thing,
ok
before
that
let
us
say
whether
you
believe
or
I
believe
doesn’ t
matter
got
right.
But,
we
consider
nature
scientist
to
consider
nature
to
be
may
be
god
or
equivalent
to
that,
nature
is
the
biggest
friend,
biggest
enemy ,
biggest
everything
nature
we
were
we
are
living
with
nature
right,
everything
is
nature.
Now ,
that
nature
has
given
such
the
other
day
when
I
was
talking
about
sub
stable
or
semi
perishable
food,
so
there
you
remember
that
we
said
that
egg
right,
just
now
I
get
the
example
of
chicken.
So
chicken
do
produce
a
egg
right
and
that
egg
on
hatching
becomes
a
baby
chicken
right.
So
to
form
the
baby
for
chicken
nature
has
given
its
egg.
Now ,
egg
that
egg
is
hatch
and
you
are
getting
the
young,
but
other
type
of
species
like
human
like
cow
like
well
like
many
others
those
which
are
mammalian
right.
It
may
be
controlled
I
am
not
sure
about
well,
but
yes
goat
or
buf falo
all
these
are
mammalian.
So,
these
mammalians
when
they
produce
the
young
they
give
birth
of
the
young
the
young
has
to
be
protected,
because
it
was
in
the
womb
of
the
mother
and
when
it
came
out
of
the
womb
of
the
mother ,
then
it
is
in
a
new
environment
altogether
dif ferent
over
what
when
it
was
or
that
particular
young
was
in
the
womb
that
baby
was
in
the
womb
that
time
it
was
all
together
dif ferent
condition
both
physical
and
everything.
And
the
moment
it
came
out
to
the
new
environment
on
the
earth
is
started
fighting
against
the
odds.
Now ,
to
protect
this
baby
from
the
all
odds
nature
has
given
the
first
few
milking
of
the
mother ,
whatever
it
be
that
mother
after
first
milking
of
few
milking
produces
this
colostrum
which
contains
lot
of
antibodies
and
many
other
properties.
Obviously ,
this
colostrum
is
quite
dif ferent
in
test
and
others
from
the
normal
milk
right,
that
is
why
you
will
say
I
do
not
know
whether
how
many
of
you
have
ever
gone
to
any
milkman
where
milk
is
being
milked
from
the
say
cow
or
buf falo
whether
you
had
ever
gone
to
those
places
or
not.
Even
if
you
had
then
you
might
have
seen
that
the
cow
which
has
given
the
birth
of
the
new
cub
is
not
allowed
to
be
milked
for
some
time,
because
that
milk
is
given
to
the
baby
cub,
because
it
contains
lot
of
colostrum
which
is
required
by
the
cub
or
young
which
whatever
way
I
am
giving
the
reference
of
cow
say
it
could
be
cub.
But
any
other
even
human
milk
also
that
can
baby
takes
the
few
milk
or
few
days
milk
from
the
mother
where
this
colostrum
is
a
part
of
that
and
protects
from
the
odds
against
the
surrounding.
Because
the
as
I
am
repeatedly
saying
that
when
it
was
in
the
womb
there
it
was
1
condition.
And
when
it
has
come
out
from
the
womb
and
took
birth
in
the
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
lot
of
other
dif ficulties
it
we
that
baby
will
encounter
to
protect
nature
has
given
that
right,
so
that
is
the
colostrum.
So,
by
definition
we
say
that
other
than
clostrum
colostrum
free
and
practically
that
the
lacteal
secretion
of
the
mammalian
of
from
the
healthy
cow
or
animal
or
mammalian
we
should
say
is
called
milk
by
definition
right,
of
course,
nowadays
other
milks
are
also
available
other
than
lacteal
secretion.
So,
that
is
why
the
second
definition
could
be
the
term
milk
is
also
used
for
white
color ,
non
animal
beverages
resembling
milk
in
color
and
texture
such
as
soy
milk,
almond
milk,
coconut
milk,
and
many
others
etcetera
right.
So
this
is
a
another
kind
of
milk
this
is
not
the
mammalian,
it
is
not
from
the
mammalian
it
is
from
not
from
the
secretion
of
the
mammary
gland
it
is
artificially
produced.
Maybe
from
soy
as
a
source,
maybe
from
coconut
as
a
source,
maybe
from
almond
as
a
source
and
many
many
such
others,
which
nowadays
are
also
available
a
commercially
also
as
milk
that
is
why
this
second
definition
is
also
important
and
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that.
That
is
also
milk
which
resembles
which
resembles
the
appearance
color
texture
of
milk,
but
not
obtained
from
the
mammary
secretion
of
or
from
the
mammalian
right.So,
if
we
see
this
then
let
us
look
into
that
what
milk
is
we
will
look
into
the
physico
chemical
properties,
and
structure
of
milk
and
milk
constituents
right.
So,
that
is
our
goal
to
do
that
again
we
come
back
to
what
is
milk.
Milk
is
the
normal
secretion
of
the
mammary
gland
of
mammals
providing
good
nourishment
for
the
young
right.
So,
for
all
mammalians
this
is
true,
that
the
secretion
of
the
mammary
gland
that
comes
out,
sources
it
can
be
any
mammalian
like
cow ,
buf falo,
goat,
sheep,
camel,
mare,
human
etcetera
etcetera,
all
mammalians
maybe
the
source
right.
Now
if
we
look
at
what
it
is
made
of
the
constituents
of
milk,
if
you
look
at
I
just
have
given
in
a
tabular
form
you
see,
that
from
the
source
it
is
dif ferent
like
buf falo,
cow ,
goat,
human,
many
many
others
are
there
I
there
is
I
cannot
make
the
list
here
because
that
will
take
itself
a
huge
time.
So,
there
are
many
many
and
the
basic
constituents
and
if
you
remember
in
the
very
early
class
we
had
said
the
basic
nutrients
what
we
know
is
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate,
then
minerals,
vitamins,
and
water
right.
So,
all
these
are
the
basic
nutrients
for
human
body
or
any
right,
so
in
that
case
this
milk
which
is
the
mammary
secretion
of
the
mammalians
is
also
made
of
all
these
nutrients,
and
depending
on
the
source
they
are
quite
dif ferent
right.
Again
the
reason
being
you
see
in
a
case
where
a
mammalian
is
nature
is.
So,
beautiful
where
mammalian
is
at
in
the
area
where
the
temperature
is
very
very
high
may
be
around
50
55,
there
are
many
places
right
typically
in
desserts
and
many
others
who
have
the
temperatures
are
very
very
high.
It
is
not
that
there
is
no
creature
yes
there
are
some
mammalians
are
also
there
like
some
other
places
where
the
temperatures
are
the
rivers
may
be
-50
or
-60.
So,
in
one
place
it
is
50
and
in
other
place
it
is
-50
and
in
both
the
places
mammalians
are
there.
So,
that
is
what
I
am
again
and
again
praising
nature
that
nature
has
made
such
beautiful
arrangement
that
the
mammalians
which
are
in
the
high
temperature
region
like
50
around
which
has
we
said.
So,
they
will
have
they
will
have
their
consequence
much
dif ferent
than
that
those
who
which
who
are
at
around
-50
very
very
cold
very
very
low
temperature
right,
and
both
are
for
the
sustenance
of
the
young
which
is
taken
birth,
for
the
sustenance
of
the
young
which
has
taken
birth,
for
that
this
is
their
nature
has
made
such.
So,
that
is
why
I
have
given
some
example
for
like
that
here
if
you
look
at
sources
we
said
buf falo
let
me
see
whether
depend
works
or
not.
Buf falo
then
cow ,
goat,
and
human.
These
are
the
4
species
we
have
given
and
the
nutrients
basic
water ,
then
fat,
then
protein,
then
carbohydrate,
and
then
ash,
this
ash
contains
all
minerals
may
not
be
the
vitamins
because
vitamins
are
very
very
heat
labile
heat
sensitive.
So,
it
is
very
dif ficult
to
just
point
out
vitamins
like
that,
but
ash
content
generally
corresponds
to
the
mineral
contents
right
of
that
typical
food
right.
So
here
you
see
and
one
more
very
very
unique
thing
again
nature
has
given
can
you
name
any
food
material,
any
natural
not
artificial.
Artificial
you
can
do
anything
right.
If
you
ask
that
you
do
one
product
for
me
which
is
the
100
percent
carbohydrate
no
other
things
you
can
manufacture,
or
if
I
ask
you
that
you
please
make
one
thing
which
is
100
percent
protein
only
you
can
manufacture
may
be
the
test
may
be
the
appearance
may
be
the
other
parameters
may
be
are
dif ferent,
but
you
can
do,
but
that
you
are
artificially
doing,
but
can
you
name
any
product
any
food
which
is
naturally
available
where
you
will
get
what
we
said
the
basic
nutrients
the
fat
protein
carbohydrate
minerals
or
vitamins
and
water
right.
So,
can
you
name
any
such
food
product
where
you
have
any
one
of
these
other
than
water?
W ater
is
one
of
the
major
constituent
of
all
the
foods,
which
you
have
said
earlier
also
one
of
the
major
constituent
of
all
the
foods
that
is
water
unless
that
is
a
dry
product
right.
All
normal
foods
are
constituted
of
major
portion
with
water ,
so
my
say
content
maybe
high
maybe
low
depending
on
the
food
case
by
case.
Now ,
as
I
said
that
can
you
name
one
food
item
where
any
one
of
these
constituents
like
fat
protein
carbohydrate
these
three
minerals
vitamins
living
aside
water
living
aside.Basically
fat
protein
carbohydrate
any
one
of
these
is
there
is
a
single
component
present
in
any
food,
can
you
name
any
perhaps
you
cannot
you
search
all
over
natural
I
am
again
and
again
highlighting,
that
this
is
natural.
So,
any
natural
product
you
will
not
find
where
fat
or
protein
or
carbohydrate
is
as
a
single
component
present
except
in
milk.
Milk
is
the
only
natural
product
where
you
can
have
one
of
these
component
one
of
these
nutrients
as
in
a
singular
form
as
a
single
component.
And
that
is
the
carbohydrate
in
milk
and
this
carbohydrate
in
milk
is
present
as
lactose
that
is
why
I
am
highlighting
I
am
giving
much
more
emphasis
on
this
that.
This
is
the
only
natural
product
where
you
have
single
nutritional
component
as
carbohydrate
as
in
the
form
of
lactose
right.
So,
if
that
be
then
let
us
look
into
that
you
see
buf falo
contains
water
around
82.14
percent,
cow
around
87.27.
This
is
not
the
exact
if
you
think
that
all
buf falo
will
have
that
all
cow
will
have
that
not
like
this.
This
is
at
representative
values
it
gives
you
idea
that
cow
milk
will
have
more
water
than
buf falo
milk
right.
Goat
around
84.17,
human
around
87.47
these
are
water
content,
fat
content
you
see
it
various
7.4
for
buf falo
then
3.66
for
cow ,
6
for
goat,
3.76
for
human,
protein
is
around
4.78
for
buf falo,
cow
around
3.47
for
protein
4.03
for
goat
and
2.14
for
human
being,
lactose
and
4.81
for
buf falo,
3.66
for
cow ,
goat
6
and
human
being
for
3.76,
ash
varies
for
buf falo
0.83,
for
cow
0.69,
for
goat
5.02,
and
for
human
0.31.
Of
course
you
are
you
are
young
maybe
somewhere
around
20
right,
or
may
be
seniors
are
also
there,
we
heard
and
it
was
also
in
media
in
newspapers
that
one
of
our
old
very
very
round
personnel
who
used
to
take
goat
milk.
So,
then
it
comes
why
because
you
see
it
contains
around
5.02
percent
ash
that
is
the
high
mineral
component
mineral
content
is
so
high
maybe
that
particular
person
could
have
been
managing
the
source
of
fat
protein
or
carbohydrate
from
some
other
sources,
but
here
also
use
see
fat
content
is
very
high
is
around
6
right,
fat
lactose
protein
all
are
very
high.
So,
goat
is
also
I
don’ t
know
how
the
test
is
I
have
not
taken
ever ,
but
yeah
it
may
have
a
dif ference
test
could
be,
but
it
is
full
of
nutrition.
So,
that
might
be
one
of
the
reason
why
that
typical
person
used
to.
Of
course,
I
am
not
talking
the
name
because
this
is
a
known
fact
right.
So,
what
we
summarize,
what
we
come
across
how
what
we
conclude
that
wide
range
of
water ,
wide
range
of
fat
maybe
from
3
to
7
or
8
wide
range
of
protein,
but
this
variation
is
not
so
high.It
is
between
say
2
to
5,
but
wide
range
of
lactose
say
around
3
and
up
to
6
and
very
very
wide
range
of
ash
around
say
0.3
to
5
depending
on
the
source
of
the
milk
it
is
coming
right.
So,
you
must
look
into
that
why
they
have
why
nature
has
given
such
variation
as
we
said
in
the
beginning
that
depending
on
the
requirement,
depending
on
these
situation,
depending
on
the
environment
the
mammalians
do
secret
accordingly
so
that
the
newly
born
is
protected
by
all
the
nutrition
nutrients,
so
that
it
can
survive
that
is
why
this
variation
is
so
high
right,
but
this
is
a
very
very
wild
saying
of
the
reason
for
variation,
there
are
many
reasons
for
variation
of
course,
if
we
come
across
if
we
get
time
we
will
also
discuss
what
are
the
reasons
or
even
this
is
for
species
we
have
said
buf falo
cow .
If
you
look
into
only
cow
there
are
many
cow
varieties,
species,
then
they
are
also
the
producing
dif ferent
constituents
of
the
nutrition.
So,
all
depends
on
many
many
factors
those
we
will
come
across
subsequently
okay
today
time
is
up
Thank
you.
