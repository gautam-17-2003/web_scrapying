Process
of
Ice
Cream
Preparation
So,
in
the
previous
class
we
had
said
the
ice
cream,
what
it
is
made
of
and
what
the
constituents
do?
What
is
the
role
of
the
constituents?
So,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology ,
lecture
number
54
let
us
look
into
how
it
is
made
right.
What
is
the
process
by
which
ice
cream
is
manufactured?
Y ou
see
I
have
given
a
flow
chart
in
that
way
that
the
solid
raw
material
whatever
it
comes
right.
W e
have
said
in
the
constituents
that
you
have
sugar ,
you
have
butter ,
you
have
stabilizer
emulsifier ,
then
solid
not
fat.
So,
all
these
solids
are
there,
all
the
materials
are
coming
and
then
milk,
in
many
cases
people
do
directly
use
milk
or
that
depends
on
the
manufacturer
where
whether
they
will
l
substitute
water
with
milk.
Or
they
will
take
water
from
the
milk
or
they
will
add
externally
water
and
make
the
composition
that
is
entirely
the
manufacturers
right
or
they
select,
but
whatever
it
comes
their
solid
raw
materials,
it
comes
right.
So;
this
solid
raw
material
comes
and
then
they
are
mixed
with
the
liquid
and
solid.
So,
this
is
mixed
and
pasteurized.
So,
after
mixing
and
pasteurization,
it
goes
to
homogenization
that
is
the
process
flowchart,
it
goes
to
homogenization
of
the
ice
cream
mix,
this
is
called
ice
cream
mix.
Here,
whatever
is
being
going
is
called
ice
cream
mix
right.
So,
this
ice
cream
mix
is
then
homogenized
and,
then
it
from
homogenization
goes
to
chilling.
After
chilling
it
is
aged
or
called
ageing,
then
it
goes
to
flavor
and
color
addition
it,
then
it
is
taken
to
the
freezer .
So,
when
it
is
been
getting
freeze
frozen
say ,
at
the
before
it
is
coming
out,
these
fruits
and
nuts
are
added
in
that,
that
softy
or
soft
ice
cream
and
then
it
is
going
to
for
bulk
packaging.
So,
maybe
small
cups
like
that
if
this
is
a
50
ml
cup
like
that
say
12
or
24
50
ml
cup,
24
numbers
are
packed
in
a
container
and
in
a
paper
pack
and
then
it
goes
for
hardening
right.
So,
bulk
packaging,
it
is
there
and
it
then
it
goes
for
hardening
and
after
hardening
it
goes
to
the
cold
room,
from
the
cold
room
goes
to
dispatch
and
to
the
market
right,
but
in
all
the
cases
there
is
a
quality
control,
which
controls
all
the
quality
at
every
stage
right.
From
the
raw
material
or
milk
then
mixing
and
pasteurization,
when
it
is
over
or
not
then,
homogenization
that
is
proper
or
not
then
chill
for
definite
period
that
is
done
or
not
then
ageing.
Sorry
ageing
is
there
for
a
definite
period
chilling
at
a
definite
temperature,
ageing
for
a
definite
period,
whether
that
is
done
then
flavors
and
colors
are
added.
Then
fruits
and
nuts
come
into
the
freezer
and
before
it
is
exiting,
then
packaging
it
should
be;
so,
every
stage
quality
control
is
being
considered
and
this
quality
control
is
controlling
the
quality
of
the
product
right.
Now ,
how
then,
what
are
the
parameters
which
is
involved
in
this
process
flowchart?
This
is
a
typical
ice
cream
making
industry ,
where
a
layout
I
have
given
right.
So,
don’ t
look
at
these,
because
these
are
some,
but
this
was,
it
is
no
longer
there,
I
used
to
work
there
that
is
why
I
could
make
it
right.
So,
here
you
see
the
primary
things
are
that,
your
product
is
coming
right,
your
product
is
coming.
Y eah,
it
is
coming
and
then
it
is
going
for
here
right.
It
is
going
for
your
mixing
and
mixing
and
after
mixing
it
is
going
for
your
pasteurization
and
then
homogenization.
And,
everywhere
there
is
a
quality
control,
which
is
coming
in
and,
this
is
a
ice
cream
lollies
are
being
made,
the
freezers
are
there
right
and,
cold
storage
hardening
room.
This
is
the
hardening
room
cold
storage
they
are
side
by
side
right.
And,
and
this
is
the
outlet
bay ,
where
the
loading
unloading
are
being
done
right.
So,
this
is
the
quality
QCR
room
quality
control
room,
where
it
is
being
then
this
is
the
aging
vats
right
and
this
is
a
brine
tank
where
your ,
ice
cream
lollies
are
being
made
right.
This
is
the
cream,
then
pasteurization
homogenization,
they
are
being
done
then,
could
be,
whatever
heating
boiler
is
coming
through
and,
these
are
the
dif ferent
freezers
which
are
used
ok.
So,
these
are
layout
for
the
entire
thing.
Then,
how
it
looks
like
under
microscope,
in
under
microscope
it
looks
like
this;
where
a
is
the
ice
crystals.
These
are
ice
crystals
right,
a
like
this,
these
are
ice
crystals
right
then
b
is
air
cells,
these
are
air
cells
right.
These
are
air
cells
and,
then
c
is
unfrozen
material,
whatever
is
not
frozen
that
part
is
c.
This
is
that
c
is
the
unfrozen
material
right
and
another
thing
which
you
need
to
know
is
that
let
me
take
it
temporarily
to
this
side,
because,
temporarily
I
am
taking
it
ok.
So,
here
you
see
that
the
unfrozen
material
is
c
and
average
distance
between
ice
crystals
or
ice
crystals
and
air
cells
is
around
6
to
8
microns
between
ice
crystals
and
ice
crystals
and
air
cells
right,
ice
crystals
is
a.
So,
that
is
this
one
and
this
one
or
this
one,
the
average
distance
is
be
around
6
to
8
microns
and
also
between
this
a
to
b
or
say
a
to
b
right.
They
are
6
to
8
microns.
A verage
distance
between
air
cells
is
around
100
to
150
microns
between
air
cells,
air
cells
where,
average
size
is
around
1 10
to
185
microns.
This
air
size
whereas,
ice
crystal
size
is
around
45
to
55
microns
right.
So,
air
cells
distance,
there
is
b
to
b,
this
is
around
150
to
108,
100
to
150
micron
size.
So,
this
is
under
microscope,
if
you
look
at,
it
looks
like
that
right.
So,
let
us
put
back
it
to
its
original
place.
So,
if
we
look
at
this
yeah.
So,
if
we
look
at
this
then
ice
cream
how
it
is
made
of
that,
the
process
is
like
this
that
you
are
pasteurizing,
whatever
be
the,
whatever
be
the
container
size
900
litre
typically
in
steam
jacketed
vessels,
70
degree
centigrade
for
30
minutes.
Then
homogenization
is
done
around
2000
liters
per
hour
in
2
stage;
1
stage
is
2500
psig
and
the
second
stage
is,
500
psig
and
fat
size
level
is
around
2
micron.
then
chilling.
This
is
done
by
counter
current
plate
heat
exchanger ,
through
ethylene
glycol
as
the
refrigerant
and
ethylene
glycol
water
mixture
and,
the
capacity
could
be
2000
liters
per
hour
and
it
is
chill
to
4
degree
centigrade.
Then
ageing
is
done
with,
Freon
12
refrigeration
in
V at
big,
big
containers
with
500
liters
and
this
is
done
for
4
hours.
Then
freezing
is
done,
usually
the
commercial
freezer
sizes
are
between
300
to
700
litres
per
hour
and
the
refrigeration
could
be
ammonia
or
could
be
Freon
12,
depending
on
what
you
have
and
the
outlet
temperature
of
ice
cream
is
minus
5.
So,
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade
this
becomes
soft,
which
you
buy
from
the
market
as
softy
that
is
temperature
is
around
minus
4
minus
4
5
like
that
right,
it
becomes
soft,
it
is
softy
and
flowable.
Unless
it
is,
it
has
flowability ,
it
will
not
go
to
the
out,
other
side
of
the
freezer
right.
So,
you
just
imagine
that
in
your
household,
deep
freezer
you
have
kept
water ,
it
got
ice.
So,
you
cannot
take
it
unless
you
force
it
right,
in
this
case
ice
cream
is
coming
out
from
the
freezer
continuously ,
because
as
you
see
it
is
around
300
to
700
liters
per
hour
capacity .
So,
that
mean
it
is
continuously
flowing
right.
So,
it
should
have
flowability
that
is
possible
if
the
temperature
is
not
lower
than
minus
5.
So,
coming
out
at
minus
5
and
initial
freezing
point
of
ice
cream
generally
is
around
minus
2.5.
So,
minus
2.5
it
is
started
freezing
and
maybe
some
portion
has
frozen
5
percent,
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
you
have
taken
out
the
ice
cream.
And,
this
soft
ice
cream
is
then
packed
and
then
kept
in
hardening
room
for
solidifying
and
then
to
the
cold
room,
that’ s
what
it
is
done.
So,
filling
that
can
be
done
manually
or
automatically ,
those
cups
which
you
get,
they
are
automatically
filled
in
the
containers
or
the
big,
big
packets
like
from
where
scoops
are
being
made
in
some
functions
or
in
some
gatherings.
So,
ice
cream
scoop
is
being
made,
that
is
from
the
gallon
packs
or
4
litre
packs,
from
there
it
is
coming
right,
then
hardening.
This
hardening
is
done
in
a
hardening
room
with
either
ammonia
or
Freon
and
the
temperature
is
around
minus
40
degrees
centigrade
right.
And,
the
product
temperature
could
be
somewhere
around
minus
30
degree
centigrade
and
it
takes
around
2
to
8
hours;
obviously ,
a
cup
of
50
ml
will
take
less
time
than
a
than
a
packet
of
4
liters
right,
4
litre
takes
around
8
to
10
hours
for
hardening.
Whereas,
a
small
cup
50
ml
may
take,
half
an
hour ,
1
hour ,
2
hour
at
the
most
depending
on
the
environment
temperature.
This
will
come
also
in
detail,
because
not
only
this
will
help,
to
a
know
about
the
ice
cream
manufacturing,
but
also
with
the
associated
refrigeration
that
also
will
be
a
little
bit
covered.
Then
the
cold
room
is
at
minus
25
with
ammonia
and
then
it
is
going
to
dispatch
for
in
with
insulated
shipper
dry
pad,
pad
van,
mechanical
refrigerated
or
refrigerated
van
or
polar
stream.
All
these
are
used
for
dispatching
the
product
from
the
production
point
to
dif ferent
places
or
agencies
or
storages
right.
In
big-big
cities
your
production
could
be
at
a
one
place
and
manufacture
could
be
at
one
place
and
consumption
could
be
at
another
place.It
is
so
big
a
distance
that
here,
if
it
is
produced
here,
if
it
is
to
be
consumed
may
be
in
between
one
cold
room
is
there.
So,
it
comes
here
stays
there
for
days
together
and
maybe
depending
on
requirement
is
goes
to
there
right.
So,
this
way
the
ice
cream
is
manufactured
in
the,
this
is
the
process
flowchart
and
the
parameters,
which
are
involved
in
the
production
right.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
how
the
ice
cream
industry
they
are
using.
This
is
a,
this
is
of
course,
small
typical.
This
is
for
the
a
of,
laboratory
use
our
thing.
So,
this
is
the
pasteurizer
right
and
then
it
goes
to
homogenizer .
So,
this
is
a
pasteurizer
with
these.
These
are
the
plate;
this
is
the
plate
heat
exchanger .
So,
with
the
controls
and
other
things,
all
pipelines,
this
is
the
commercial
one.
So,
pasteurizer
are
using
for
pasteurizations
plate,
plate
heat
exchanges.
Then
it
goes
to,
then
it
goes
to
homogenizer .
So,
this
is
the
typical
homogenizer
right,
APV
make,
so
that
homogenizer
is
homogenizer ,
the
fat
to
around
say
2
micron
and
this
is
a
2
stage.
So,
1
stage
is
around
2500
psig
and
the
second
stage
is
around
500
psig
right.
Then
from
there
it
goes
to
the
freezer .
This
is
a
typical
view
for
ice
cream
freezer
right
and
till
this
typical
view
is
that,
it
includes
everything.
Number
1,
this
is
the
part
where
the
refrigeration
takes
place
right,
that
the
refrigeration
part
is
all
along
like
this
and
this
is
the
part
where
the
feed
of
the
ice
cream
mix
is
happening
as
well.
The
air
is
being
fed
and
this
is
the
ice
cream
freezer .
The
heart
of
the
ice
cream
industry
ice
cream
freezer
right;
what
it
is
doing?
So,
if
it
is
the
ammonia
or
Freon
12,
whatever
that
is,
under
this
section
right.
So,
the
liquid
either
ammonia
or
Freon,
that
is
then
coming
to
the
ice
cream
freezer
right.
This
is
at
the
outlet;
you
see
it
is
insulated
right
like
this.
This
is
insulated
and
the
liquid
is
coming
here
and
this
is
called
boil
of
technology
right.
Liquid
ammonia
or
Freon
that
is
coming
here
and
getting
boiled
up
right,
giving
the
latent
heat
right;
delta
H
giving
the
latent
heat
to
the
product
right.
Sensibility
it
is
not
so
much
available,
because
the
moment
this
liquid
is
vaporized
that
vapor
comes
out
and
comes
back
and
again
put
back
into
the
cycle
right.
So,
that
is
the
vapor
which
is
coming
in
out.
So,
this
refrigerant
is
coming
here,
the
refrigerant
is
going
out
from
there.
Then
the
other
two
thing
is
the
mix
and
the
pump
mix
and
the
air .
Now
both
mix
and
air ,
this
is
the
dual
pump
right.
In
one
case
this
is
mix
is
getting
in,
in
another
case
that
air;
that
is
getting
in
right.
So,
both
air
and
the
ice
cream
mix,
they
are
going
in
and
put
into
the
system
right
and
this
system
is
this.
So,
this
is
the
wall
inner
wall
of
the
ice
cream
and
ice
cream
wall.
If
you
have
seen
it,
it
is
like
a
mirror
or
more
than
a
mirror
right.
So,
here
you
need
to
know
a
little
about
the
freezing
right,
because
freezing
if
you
see
that,
the
faster
the
freezing
the
quicker
the
freezing.
The
ice
crystal
sizes
are
smaller .
The
smaller
the
ice
crystal
sizes
less
is
the
space
required
for
the
volume
expanded.
W e
know
that
9
cc
of
water ,
when
it
is
getting
converted
into
ice
1 1
cc
of
the
ice
is
formed.
So,
that
is
called
9
1 1;
this
9-1 1
conversion;
that
is
less
water
volume
with
more
ice
volume.
So,
that
ice
volume
has
to
be,
has
to
be
accommodated.
Now
this
9
to
1 1,
if
it
is
9
to
1 1,
then
only
two
if
it
is
900
to
1 100,
then
it
is
200
right,
but
if
it
is
0.09
to
0.1,
then
it
is
very
small,
even
if
it
is
even
smaller
0.0009
to
0.01,
then
it
is
even
smaller .
So;
that
means,
the
quicker
the
freezing,
the
smaller
will
be
the
ice
crystal
size
and
the
smaller
the
ice
crystal
size,
the
better
for
the
quality
of
the
product
right.
And
if
that
is
there,
that
is
being
done
in
this
section;
that
is
the
ice
cream
manufacturing
section
right.
So,
the
product
or
this,
this
mix
along
with
the
air
is
going
in.
So,
here
this
mix
was
at
4
degree
centigrade
after
ageing.
So,
at
4
degree
centigrade,
this
makes
is
getting
pumped,
entering
into
the
inlet
of
the
ice
cream
freezer .
Now
this
4
degree
centigrade,
when
it
is
coming
out
of
this.
This
is
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade
right,
and
it
is
a
continuous,
as
we
said
300
liters
per
hour ,
say
or
700
liters
per
hour .
That
means,
at
every
hour
700
liters
ice
cream
is
being
formed.
So,
when
it
is
entering
here
at
4
degree,
by
the
time
it
comes
out
from
the
exit,
it
is
at
minus
5,
a
semi
solid
or
flowable
composition,
flowable
composition.
So,
that
minus
5
degree,
this
is
being
done.
This
is
called
the
scrapped
surface
heat
exchanger
or
SSHE
scrapped
surface
heat
exchanger .
So,
this
is
generally
written
as
scrapped,
scrapped
surface
heat
exchanger
right,
what
actually
is
happening?
If
this
is
the
wall
of
the
ice
cream
barrel;
that
is
called
barrel,
this
is
called
barrel.
So,
in
this
barrel
this
outer
side
is
with
the
refrigerant
right.
This
outer
side
is
with
the
refrigerant
which
is
at
say
minus
30
minus
28,
depending
on
what
refrigerant
you
are
using.
It
is
giving
at
it’ s
latent
heat
delta
H
to
this
wall
right,
and
this
wall.
This
ice
cream,
say
we
talk
about
1
molecule.
I
cannot
make
the
color
another ,
let
me,
let
me
try
whether
it
is
making,
yeah,
so
if
this
is
a
ice
cream
mix
molecule.
So,
then
that
comes
here
at
the
entry ,
then
it
is
may
going
here
to
the
wall
getting
is
solidified,
because
the
then
it
will
be
solidified,
then
the
scrapper
blade
which
is
this
one.
There
is
the
blade
here,
the
scrapper
blade;
that
is
scrapping
of f,
that
is
scrapping
it
of f
like
this
right.
If
this
is
the
blade,
so
it
is
going
like
this
and
scrapping
it
up
like
that
right.
This
scrapping
is
done
by
the
scrapper
blade,
the
moment
inside
ice
cream
is
formed
so
that
getting
then
mixed
with
the
interior
and
from
this
4
degree
here,
it
has
become
say
minus
0.1
degree
and
then
gradually
it
is
mixing,
mixing
and
getting
frozen
like
that
and
moving,
and
at
the
end
when
it
is
coming
here,
it
is
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade
right.
So,
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
it
is
coming
the
way
it
is
mixing
with
the
inside
of
the
of
the
blade,
inside
of
the
barrel
where
it
is
getting
frozen,
getting
a
scrapped
of f
it
mixed
with
the
remaining
ice
cream
liquid,
whose
temperature
is
gradually
going
down
from
plus
4
degree
to
minus
5
degree.
So,
plus
4
to
minus
5,
this
entire
length
of
the
ice
cream
freezer
is
taking
place.
So,
this
is
what
that
ice
cream,
this
length
within
this
length.
This
is
4
degree
centigrade
and
this
is
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade;
that
is
coming
out
right.
Now ,
what
is
happening
after
that?
this
ice
cream
now
here
which
is
flowable
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
this
is
kept,
this
is
being
hold
in
containers
like
cups,
maybe
50
ml
or
maybe
100
ml
bigger
cups
right.
100
ml
they
are,
they
are
filled
in
say
in
circular .
These
kind
of
your
things
are
there
where
cups
are
being
made
and
some
mechanism
by
which,
when
it
is
coming
here;
that
is
getting
shifted
to
the
next
and
this
way
it
is
moving
right.
And
when
all
are,
it
is
in
a
line
and
maybe
from
here
it
goes
to
a
chain
sprocket
line,
where
your
ice
cream.
This
cup
leads
are
being
put
right
and
then
maybe
if
it
is
100
ml,
then
12
bit
numbers.
It
is
packed
in
a
in
a
paper
container
or
if
it
is
50
ml
then
it
is
packed
in
a
in
a
24
numbers
container ,
a
paper
packet
right
and
that
is
kept
in
the
hardening
room
for
hardening
or
may
be
from
here
that
entire
thing
comes
into
your
container ,
which
is
1
litre
pack
called
party
pack.
1
litre
pack,
that
is
called
party
pack
or
generally
not
in
kg,
but
liter ,
1
litre
party
pack
or
maybe
4
litre
called
gallon
pack
right.
4
litre
called
gallon
pack,
because
one
gallon
typically
is
3.75
or
something
like
that.
But
since
in
our
country
it
is
not
gallon,
it
is
litre.
So,
it
is
4
litre
packs
where
big
packets
of
4
litres
are
filled
automatically
and
then
these
all
are
taken
to
that
hardening
room,
which
we
had
said
the
hardening
room
is
say
minus
35
to
minus
40
degree
centigrade
right.
So,
minus
35
to
minus
40
degree
centigrade,
these
are
kept
for
2
to
10
hours,
depending
on
size
shape
etcetera
right.
So,
after
this
is
hardened,
then
it
goes
to
the
cold
room
and
this
cold
room
it
is
kept
maybe
for
1
day ,
maybe
for
10
days,
maybe
for
depending
on
the
sale
of
the
product
right.
And,
then
this
is
dispersed
through
dif ferent
medium.
So,
that
we
will
discuss
in
the
next
class
that
how
the
frozen
foods
are
being
distributed;
in
what
way
they
are
getting
distributed.
What
is
the
mechanism?
How
they
are
surviving?
These
things
we
will
discuss
in
the
next
class,
because
today
we
are
running
out
of
time.
Hopefully
you
have
understood
the
manufacturing
process
and
why
all
the
steps
are
required,
what
is
their
purpose,
these
we
have
tried
to
give
you
in
detail
ok.
Thank
you.
