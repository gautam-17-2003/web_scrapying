Small
Constituents
of
Milk
Ready .
So,
we
were
discussing
about
the
small
constituents,
the
major
constituents
I
have
already
been
discussed,
earlier
the
smaller
constituents
out
of
which
cholesterol
this
is
our
lecture
number
35
in
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology ,
this
course.
So,
we
will
discuss
small
constituents
of
milk
whatever
is
still
remaining,
right.
So,
out
of
which
we
said
cholesterol
which
we
finished
in
the
last
class
and
we
also
said
that
cholesterol
is
nowadays
is
not
considered
as
bad
as
it
was
in
the
earlier
years.
It
was
imposed,
that
yes
don’ t
take
foods
which
have
high
cholesterol
etcetera
etcetera
your
level
will
go
up
etcetera.
But
sciences
like
that
today
it
is
something
is
very
good
tomorrow
it
may
may
not
be
so
things
like
that
this
is
this
is
a
changing
process
it
is
not
a
constant
that,
but
other
than
there
are
few
which
normally
do
not,
but
those
things
like
this
are
variable.
T oday
it
is
good,
tomorrow
it
is
bad
or
tomorrow
it
is
good,
today
it
is
bad
things
like
that,
ok.
So,
milk
contents
around
105
to
176
parts
per
million
your
cholesterol,
right.
And
I
here
specifically
we
have
not
send
out
of
which
how
much
is
low
density
lipid
or
high
cholesterol
is
an
part
of
lipid
it
is
in
the
lipid
family .
So,
it
is
that
we
had
said
when
we
are
said
in
the
lipid,
right.
And
this
whether
it
is
low
density
or
high
density
lipid
that
that
they
distribution
I
have
not
said,
right.
So,
it
is
the
total
cholesterol
present
in
milk.
Other
things
which
are
present
in
small
are
pigments
out
of
which
some
are
water
soluble
and
some
are
fat
soluble,
right.
Because
pigments
they
are
also
water
soluble,
they
are
also
fat
soluble,
so
depending
on
whether
they
are
water
soluble
or
fat
soluble
pigments
we
can
distribute
into
two;
two
we
can
divide
into
two
parts
one
is
fat
soluble
and
other
is
water
soluble.
Fat
soluble
is
carotenoids
and
water
soluble
is
riboflavin,
right.
So,
that
the
colour
of
milk
if
you
remember ,
the
colour
of
milk
when
we
were
talking
about
we
were
saying
that
if
the
fat
content
is
high
then
the
colour
may
be
yellowish.
Do
you
remember?
But
it
is
not
always
that
if
the
carotene
content
is
high
or
carotenoids
are
present
in
high
concentration
then
that
may
influence
on
the
colour
of
the
milk,
right.
So,
they
the
bad
people,
the
bad
intentioned
business
mind
business
people
they
do
take
this
into
consideration,
right.
So,
this
comes
under
feed,
carotenoids
that
will
come
under
feed.
So,
if
the
feed
is
accordingly
controlled
so
that
also
we
will
give
some
yellowish
colour
to
the
milk
which
is
deceiving,
right.
And
also
that
way
which
sometimes
it
is
on
the
colour
which
we
see
or
the
bluish
tint
which
comes
from
the
milk
that
is
because
that
is
because
of
the
riboflavin
present
in
milk.
Riboflavin
is
water
soluble
carotenoide
or
carotenes
are
or
carotenoids
are
fat
soluble,
right.
So,
feeds
as
green
grass
green
alfa-alfa
hay ,
these
are
green
silage
and
carrots
etcetera
they
are
rich
in
carotene.
So,
if
they
are
fed
like
that
so
they
will
automatically
give
the
milk
which
will
be
yellowish
in
colour
not
desirable
because
we
want
the
yellow
colour
from
the
fat
not
from
pigments,
right.
Similarly ,
riboflavin
which
is
previously
known
as
lactoflavin
or
lactochrome
these
contributes
yellowish
green
tint
to
the
whey ,
right,
yellowish
green
tint
to
the
whey .
So,
the
whey
which
comes
out
that
is
again
greenish
in
colour
you
will
see
you
will
you
can
ask
your
mummy
who
do
or
who
does
all
these
or
seniors
that
when
they
make
the
chhena
that
the
leftover
that
is
whey
the
colour
of
it,
and
you
will
see
in
most
of
the
cases
they
will
say
why
it
is
greenish
in
colour ,
right.
Y ellowish
greenish
tint
is
there
and
that
is
primarily
due
to
the
presence
of
riboflavin.
They
are
they
are
they
are
concentration
is
very
very
small,
but
good
enough
to
show
their
presence,
right.
So,
from
there
let
us
move
to
others,
this
we
have
already
said.Others
like
milk
enzymes
this
is
another
umbrella
where
lot
of
enzymes
are
present
in
milk
and
lot
of
activities
they
do,
right.
Around
20
enzymes
have
been
characterized,
whereas
40
more
enzymes,
they
are
presence
via
they
are
40
more
enzymes
also
show
their
presence
through
there
activities.
So,
20
enzymes
have
been
characterized
from
milk,
right.
Characterized
means
they
are
identified
and
they
are
they
have
been
seen
the
observed,
presence
in
milk
and
they
are
separated
identified
like
that.
So,
there
is
a
20.
Whereas,
40
more
enzymes
show
their
presence
through
their
activity
may
not
be
that
those
enzymes
could
be
isolated
and
then
identified
through
a
through
experimentations,
but
their
presence
is
felt
with
the
activity
they
show ,
right.
So,
indigenous
milk
enzymes
are
found
in
or
associated
with
associated
with
casein
in
casein
micelle
or
fat
globule
membrane
and
milk
serum
or
somatic
cells.
So,
in
this
case
another
new
term
is
come
up
that
is
called
somatic
cells
rest
of
the
things
we
have
discussed
in
many
because
fat
global
membrane
FGM,
we
have
discussed
earlier
casein
micelle
we
have
discussed
earlier .
Somatic
cell,
somatic
cell
is
a
cell
which
is
presence
in
all
parts
of
the
body
except
the
reproductive
parts
or
cells,
except
the
reproductive
cells
all
ells
are
called
somatic
cells,
right.
This
is
another
information.
So,
these
enzymes
may
originate
from
blood,
right,
somatic
cells
or
fat
globule
membrane
or
cell
cytoplasm,
so
from
any
where
these
enzymes
may
come
up.
Enzymes
serves
two
purposes
as
indicators
that
is
health
of
the
animal
and
thermal
history
of
the
milk,
right.
So,
these
presence
of
enzymes
or
the
identification
of
the
enzymes,
identification
of
the
enzymes
do
play
that
this
serves
two
purposes
two
how
one
is
the
more
the
enzymes
presents
that
will
tell
the
health
of
the
health
of
the
animal
from
where
you
are
drawing
the
milk
and
the
status
of
the
milk
that
is
thermal
stability
or
thermal
history
of
the
milk,
right.
Because
it
is
not
likely
that
in
today’ s
scenario
if
you
are
in
urban
areas
may
not
be
in
rural
to
so
much,
so
much
so
much
so
much
things
are
af fecting,
but
in
urban
areas
obviously ,
you
will
not
get
milk
drawn
now
and
in
an
hour
it
is
served
to
your
house.
Normally
they
are
processed
and
then
it
is
then
it
is
circulated
through
some
mechanisms
of
chain
distributions.
But
the
presence
of
enzymes
or
identification
of
these
enzymes
in
that
milk
will
tell
you
how
good
or
how
bad
your
thermal
processing
was
there,
and
how
good
or
how
bad
your
original
source
of
the
animal
that
is
health
of
the
animal
how
good
or
bad
it
was.
So,
these
two
are
the
indicators
of
the
presence
of
enzymes.
Functions
of
enzymes
are
like
it
can
deteriorate
quality ,
it
can
induce
desirable
changes,
it
can
of fer
protective
ef fects.
So,
3
primary
functions
we
can
identify .
That
obviously ,
it
enzymes
can
do
good
or
bad,
if
you
remember
I
gave
the
examples
of
knife.
So,
knife
is
also
similar
thing
which
you
can
used
for
good
purpose
you
can
use
for
bad
purpose.
So,
enzymes
in
milk
are
also
like
that
it
can
be
you
it
uses
for
some
good
purposes
it
is
also
it
can
cause
some
bad
output
or
bad
things
in
the
milk,
right.
So,
apart
from
that
it
can
also
act
as
a
protective
agent
or
it
can
give
the
protection
of
the
milk
if
there
be,
right.
So,
these
3
purposes
enzymes
do
function,
right.
So,
the
enzymes
which
are
normally
an
at
a
at
a
glance
we
can
say
the
ptyalin,
now
the
other
day
you
are
saying
that
in
our
this
mouth
cavity
or
this
or gano
or gano
this
what
we
call
this
olfactory
region
in
this
mouth
cavity
and
nasal
cavity ,
particularly
in
mouth
cavity
we
in
the
saliva
lot
of
enzymes
are
there
lot
of
enzymes
are
secreted.
Is
not
at
any
movement
you
take
it
and
you
get
all
all
of
them
that’ s
why
I
give
the
example
that
parents
and
other
seniors
they
do
ask
you
to
chew
and
then
swallow
or
engulf
the
food
material,
other
than
just
taking
it
and
swallowing
it
this
at.
So,
chew
it,
the
moment
you
are
chewing
that
secretion
of
the
enzymes
starts
through
alive
saliva,
right.
So,
that
is
why
chewing
is
a
very
very
important
step
for
digestion.
So,
in
those
things
so
many
enzymes
are
there
in
our
body
system
in
our
saliva.
Similarly
so
many
enzymes
are
there
in
milk
also
one
such
ptyalin
which
is
present
in
our
saliva
is
one
which
acts
on
this
starch
forming
maltose.
Starch
is
degraded
by
this
ptyalin
enzyme
and
this
degrades
starch
because
starch
we
know
that
is
the
polymer
of
glucose
that
is
the
polymer
of
glucose.
So,
n
number
of
glucose
they
are
depending
on
the
source
of
this
starch,
this
n
can
be
many ,
right.
It
varies
widely
from
source
to
source,
right.
But
really
very
lar ge
number
very
very
high
numbers
of
glucose
monomers
are
polymerized
in
starch,
right.
And
in
the
also
you
have
if
we
don’ t
know
then
let
us
also
tell
here,
that
there
are
two
types
of
starch,
one
is
amylose
and
other
is
amylopectin,
right.
This
is
true
for
any
food
amylose
and
amylopectin,
and
out
of
which
amylose
is
a
straight
chain
where
the
glucose
poly
monomers
are
attached
by
straight
chain
and
in
the
amylopectin
there
are
some
branching
may
be
after
every
20
30
40
units
of
this
glucose
polymers
there
could
a
branching
from
where
another
20
30
may
be
attached
and
further
branching
could
be
from
there
or
from
this
straight
chain.
So,
amylopectin
is
branched,
amaylose
is
straight
chain
that
is
why
in
amylose
the
linking
is
alpha
1
4
linkage,
right.
Alpha
1
4
linkage
since
it
has
come.
So,
I
will
just
tell
that
that
this
is
the
glucose,
right,
this
is
the
oxygen
this
is
CH
2
OH,
right.
Whether
it
is
alpha
beta
I
am
going
into
that
these
are
hydrogen
and
hydroxyl
groups,
right.
Normally
this
is
called
1
position,
right,
this
is
1
2
3
4
5
and
this
is
6,
right.
So,
when
1
4
are
there
another
similar
this
is
1,
another
glucose
at
4
is
clubbed
together
farming
the
chain,
right,
that
is
the
straight
chain.Whereas,
in
the
branching
these
one
position
is
coupled
with
this
exposition
of
another ,
right.
So,
there
it
is
1
6,
this
glycosidic
linkage
and
this
is
1
4
glycosidic
linkage,
right.
So,
that
is
what
happens
in
amylase.
However ,
starch
when
this
is
degraded
that
time
you
get
this
maltose
which
is
an
intermediate
from
the
starch
big
molecule
to
a
smaller
molecule
maltose
that
is
available
the
degradation
of
this
from
the
starch
is
done
by
the
enzyme
called
ptyalin.
Some
others
like
pepsin
in
the
stomach
which
assists
in
breaking
down
of
the
protein,
right.
the
earlier
also
I
get
this
example
pepsin,
are
which
acts
on
the
proteins
to
break
it
down,
because
ultimately
whatever
you
take
whether
it
is
whether
it
is
carbohydrate
fat
or
protein
they
are
big
big
molecules
depending
on
the
particular
one
you
are
taking.
So,
those
are
ultimately
degraded
to
the
by
the
body
system
to
either
produce
some
proteins
which
are
helping
your
body
or
may
be
some
ener gy ,
or
may
be
respiration,
or
things
like
that,
right.
So,
it
is
not
the
bigger
molecules
which
are
directly
utilized.
So,
they
are
also
broken
in
our
stomach
that
is
the
reactor ,
and
in
that
reactor
lot
many
enzymes
are
there.
This
is
one
such
pepsin
which
is
degrading
protein
to
a
smaller
units,
right.
Y ou
have
seen
proteins
are
so
big,
so
they
are
also
broken
into
smaller
units,
right.
Then
galactase,
galactase
is
a
proteolytic
enzyme
that
acts
on
the
ripening
of
cheese.
If
we
come
across
sometime
afterwards
preparation
of
cheese
when
will
go
there
that
time
we
will
see
the
cheese
while
making
it
galactase
helps
a
lot
in
proteolyt
that
is
the
proteolytic
enzyme
galactase
which
acts
on
the
protein
and
during
the
ripening
of
cheese.
This
ripening
is
not
the
ripening
of
our
fruits
like
guava
from
green
to
yellow ,
mango
from
green
to
yellow
that
we
call
ripening.
This
is
another
ripening,
right.
Though
the
word
is
similar
ripening,
but
the
meaning
is
dif ferent.
So,
there
in
cheese
forming
this
break
down
of
the
protein
is
also
done
by
the
enzyme
called
galactase,
right.
Then
lipase,
lipase
is
an
enzyme
which
acts
on
lipid
which
we
have
already
said.
So,
lipid
is
degraded
by
lipase
and
milk
contents
lot
of
lipase
and
this
lipase
can
break
down
or
the
if
when
for
example,
when
you
are
doing
since
it
has
come
when
you
are
doing
homogenization
that
you
are
you
are
breaking
down
the
bigger
fat
molecule
into
smaller
fat
molecule,
right.
So,
when
you
are
making
this
and
we
have
said
that
there
is
a
fat
globule
membrane.
So,
that
membrane
if
it
is
broken
then
the
fat
becomes
exposed.
So,
this
enzyme
that
is
the
lipase
acts
readily
on
that
and
thereby
it
destroys
or
it
deteriorates
that
fat
producing
maybe
of
or
some
undesirable
thing,
right.
So,
this
lipase
act
is
also
there
and
it
acts
on
that.Then
catalase,
catalase
is
an
oxidizing
enzyme
or
oxidizing
enzyme.
So,
any
oxidizing
deterioration
of
the
fat
can
be
initiated
by
catalyst.
Then
reductase
this
is
a
reducing
enzyme.
So,
any
reduction
process
can
be
in
a
enhanced
or
initiated
by
the
enzyme
called
reductase
then
lactase,
lactase
is
a
sugar
fermenting
enzyme,
right.
This
we
have
been
telling
repeatedly
that
when
you
are
doing
lactase
if
lactase
is
there
then
that
acts
on
acts
on
the
on
the
substrate
called
lactose
which
is
the
milk
sugar ,
right.
So,
on
the
milk
sugar
this
lactose
is
acting
and
then
forming
your
lactic
acid.
So,
this
lactic
acid
is
not
in
this
case
desirable,
right.
In
this
case
it
is
not
desirable
because
ultimately
we
know
if
the
isoelectric
part
or
if
the
pH
comes
to
the
level
of
4.6
then
it
is
not
desirable
then
casein
comes
out
casein
precipitates.
So,
this
lactase
is
acting
on
the
lactose
and
that
lactose
is
producing
lactic
acid
which
is
not
desirable.
So,
you
see
some
are
desirable,
some
are
not
desirable
depending
on
the
usage
depending
on
the
requirement
depending
on
how
they
are
acting
on
at
what
condition
so
that
could
be
beneficial
or
that
could
be
detrimental,
right.
Then
diastase,
in
many
of
the,
in
many
of
the
digestive
medicines
you
will
see
that
this
diastase
is
written,
right.
So,
this
diastase
is
a
starch
splitting
enzyme
again
it
can
act
on
this
starch
diastase
and
starch
whether
it
is
alpha
amylase
or
beta
oh
sorry
amylase
or
amylopectin
does
not
matter ,
diastase
act
on
both
of
them.
So,
starch
is
being
splitted
by
the
enzyme
diastase.
So,
diastase
you
can
in
this
case
if
you
are
taking
it
to
be
for
digestion
then
you
can
say
that
for
digestion
diastase
is
a
very
good
enzyme,
right,
helpful
enzyme.
So,
you
can
utilize
it
in
a
good
way
diastase
is
also
present
in
milk.
Then
peroxidase,
peroxidase
again
is
an
oxidizing
enzyme
peroxidase
is
again
an
oxidizing
enzyme.
So,
the
enzymes
which
oxidizes
now ,
that
can
oxidize
fat,
that
can
oxidize
protein
depending
on
wherever
or
carbohydrate.
So,
depending
on
wherever
how
the
reactions
are
happening
what
is
the
substrate
how
the
substrate
is
available.
So,
all
these
are
there
so
oxidation
can
be
initiated
by
the
peroxidase,
right.
The
name
and
you
will
see
all
the
enzymes
whatever
till
now
we
have
mentioned
or
named
some
many
others
also
there
will
come
and
these
enzymes
are
ending
with
a
s
e,
right.
Peroxidase,
then
galactase,
then
lipase,
then
catalase
except
ptyalin,
right.
Ptyalin
of
the
saliva
which
acts
on
starch
for
being
maltose
this
ptyalin
except
that
all
are
some
exceptions
could
be
they
are
all
are
ending
with
the
ase,
a
s
e.
So,
enzymes
are
always
with
the
ending
with
a
s
e
ase,
right,
lactase,
then
lipase,
then
reductase,
peroxidase
etcetera.So,
another
enzyme
which
is
very
very
important
in
milk
is
called
phosphatase.
This
is
an
enzyme
to
test
for
evaluating,
ef fectiveness
of
pasteurization,
right.
This
is
already
present
in
milk
all
these
which
till
now
we
have
discussed
are
present
in
milk
and
pasteurization
though
we
have
not
separately
said,
but
at
this
referred
many
many
times
that
this
is
the
process
by
which
the
inactivation
of
the
pathogenic
or ganisms
are
done
and
the
name
came
up
from
the
name
of
Louis
Pasteur ,
right.
So,
the
scientist
Louis
Pasteur
from
his
name
it
came
up
as
pasteur
process
as
pasteurization.
So,
this
we
are
heating,
right.
So,
that
and
we
also
said
earlier
that
heating
is
not
a
single
parameter
that
is
temperature,
it
is
always
a
combination
of
time
and
temperature
that
is
af fecting.
The
time
and
temperature
that
what
temperature
for
how
long
you
are
heating
according
to
that
the
af fect
will
be
found
or
ef fect
will
be
understood.
So,
depending
on
how
much
you
are
heating.
So,
you
are
destroying
the
may
be
all
these
enzymes,
may
be
some
or ganisms
etcetera
and
for
pasteurization
it
is
the
or ganisms
which
are
diseased
causing
diseased
producing
or ganisms
they
are
destroyed.
And
this
disease
producing
or ganisms
are
many ,
and
they
are
called
normally
the
they
are
called
your
disease
producing
or ganisms
and
they
are
what
they
are
said
to
be
this
of
course,
it
is
there
producing
disease
and
harmful
of
course,
they
are
harmful
or ganisms
and
this
or ganisms
are
killed
by
the
heat
treatment.
Now ,
whether
pathogenic,
yes.
Now
term
was
not
coming
in
when
often.
So,
pathogenic
or ganism
they
are
disease
causing
or ganism
and
this
pathogens
are
killed
by
the
heat
treatment.
Now ,
where
that
the
heat
treatment
was
correct
or
not
to
the
extent
it
was
good
or
not
this
suf ficient
to
kill
all
the
disease
producing
or
pathogenic
or ganisms
are
not
is
checked
by
these
in
presence
of
these
enzyme
phosphatase,
because
phosphatase
is
such
an
enzyme
which
is
resistant
compare
to
other
compare
to
other
your
enzymes.
So,
today
we
are
we
have
come
to
the
end.
So,
again
enzymes
will
discuss
in
the
next
class.
Thank
you.
