Packaging
of
Food
Materials
So,
in
our
this
58th
class
of
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
we
should
cover
also
some
packaging
because
processing
and
other
things
we
have
already
discussed
a
lot
and
packaging
an
storage
this
we
have
discussed,
but
may
not
be
so
elaborately .
So,
let
us
also
look
into
the
Packaging
of
Food
Materials
with
typically
with
respect
to
dairy
and
food
materials
both
right,
because
liquid
and
solid
in
that
liquid
milk
we
had
shown
you
more
or
less
elaborately
liquid
milk
packaging
and
distribution.
All
these
we
have
discussed
elaborately ,
but
since
it
is
also
a
part
of
the
food
that
is
solid,
we
have
also
covered
a
little
of
solid.
So,
this
both
liquid
and
solid
we
should
take
care
of
the
packaging
right.
So,
first
you
see
nowadays,
those
which
you
get
from
the
market
like
your
keeps
or
this
and
that.
So,
all
of
them
you
must
have
seen
that
they
are
filled
with
some
gaseous
right
had
it
been
only
chips.
The
volume
would
have
required
very
little,
but
your
material
is
only
this
much,
but
the
packet
is
so
big
right.
So,
that
is
primarily
because,
the
environment
around
the
product
you
got
it
changed.
Why?
Definitely
to
give
its
shelf
life
much
more
than
what
it
would
have
been
otherwise.
Depending
on
the
product,
depending
on
how
you
are
preparing,
depending
on
how
much
fat
content
are
consistency
or
constituents
of
the
product;
the
packaging
type,
packaging
variety
everything
changes.
Because
nowadays,
you
have
seen
the
market
is
primarily
dominated
by
the
packaging
and
the
better
the
packaging,
the
attractive
the
packaging
inside
product
because,
you
are
not
able
to
see
what
is
there
inside
unless
you
take
spend
money
take
and
then
taste,
you
do
not
know
what
whether
that
will
suit
you
would
like
that
or
etcetera
etcetera.
1So,
packaging
is
a
primary
or
important
step
for
your
product
both
storing
as
well
as
selling
right.
It
is
also
storing
mind
it
because
you
might
have
seen
that
in
the
packets
it
is
written
best
before
6
months
or
some
packets
best
before
1
year
or
in
some
packets
may
be
best
before
3
months
etcetera
or
directly
it
is
given
date
of
manufactures
such
and
date
of
expire
is
such
right.
And
that
time
could
be
1
month
or
even
more
depending
on
obviously ,
the
product
you
were
handling
or
you
were
packing.
So,
for
that
different
types
of
packaging
will
come
across
and
also
in
this
regard
would
like
to
highlight
or
discuss
a
little
above
the
storage
through
that
right.
We
have
already
discussed
a
lot
about
the
cold
storage
that
the
ice
cream
and
many
other
frozen
products.
They
are
stored
in
the
cold
store
and
we
have
discussed
a
lot
within
the
in
the
purview
of
the
course
right.
So,
it
is
not
that
whatever
you
have
discussed
as
the
end
of
the
entire
thing
know
within
the
purview
of
the
course
whatever
cold
store
we
have
discussed.
Because,
cold
store
when
you
do,
you
have
to
also
design
it
is
not
that
you
make
a
room
and
you
go
and
dump
your
material.
The
primary
reason
is
that;
your
purpose
is
to
supply
to
support
with
a
definite
temperature.
So,
that
definite
temperature
and
constant
definite
and
a
constant
temperature
it
should
not
fluctuate
that
to
make
it
you
have
to
design
and
that
cold
storage
design
not
only
on
thermal
that
is
on
refrigeration
part,
but
also
civil
part
is
also
there.
Because,
that
to
if
it
is
a
sub
0
1
type,
if
it
is
a
above
0
another
type.
In
all
the
cases,
there
is
also
some
vapor
barrier
because
your
insulating
material
that
should
not
be
affected
by
moisture.
So,
in
the
room
like
in
this
room,
moisture
is
there
according
to
the
relative
humidity
of
this
room
and
that
moisture
if
that
is
cooled
and
if
that
is
getting
deposited
on
the
insulating
material,
then
the
performance
of
the
insulating
material
will
go
down.
So,
to
avoid
that,
civil
part
is
also
and
not
only
that,
but
also
for
the
structural
strength
civil
part
is
also
equally
important.
So,
refrigeration
civil
mechanical,
then
our
food
all
put
together
we
will
design
a
cold
store
either
above
zero
or
subzero.
So,
both
the
cases;
obviously ,
the
design
consideration
parameters
will
be
different.
2And
unfortunately ,
this
is
not
within
the
purview
of
this
course
because
where
to
start
and
where
to
end
right.
So,
I
have
been
giving
you
these
inputs
and
then
you
think
you
thought
give
you
thought
and
then,
you
design
or
you;
know
you
develop
yourself.
So,
that
you
can
also
become
a
one
good
designer ,
but
that
course
is
different.
I
do
not
know
whether
in
future
I
will
be
able
to
float
such
like
a
cooling
technology
in
agriculture
and
food
engineering.
Let
us
hope
we
can
and
if
we
can,
then
at
that
time
all
these
will
come
into
right.
Obviously ,
we
will
not
repeat
this
whatever
has
been.
And,
there
is
always
a
little
overlapping
of
the
subject
of
the
topic
of
the
understanding
that
is
unavaidable
right.
But,
as
far
as
practicable,
we
will
try
to
do
that.
However
coming
back
to
the
cold
store
that
when
you
are
designing
you
have
also
to
look
into
that
like
in
this
room
suppose,
if
it
is
a
cold
store
and
suppose
this
is
a
this
is
a
ice
cream
cold
store,
there
is
sub
0
-
20,
then
and
you
imagine
that
all
ice
creams
are
being
stacked
one
over
other
throughout
the
room.
And
then,
that
should
be
cooled
because
from
the
evaporator
the
cold
layer
has
to
circulate.
So,
there
has
to
be
a
force
circulation
through
fan.
So,
that
uniform
temperature
throughout
is
maintained
because
sub
0
-
20
if
it
is
going
up.
So,
-
10
as
such
you
will
get
this
water
not
completely
not
completely
transformed
into
ice
completely
transformed
into
water
that
part
will
not
be;
but
definitely
some
temporary
and
localized
this
transformation
will
go
up
which
we
discussed
about
the
freeze
and
thaw
that
thing
will
appear
or
happen
which
is
never
desirable
for
the
product.
So,
you
have
to
be
cautious
about
that
circulation
of
air
stacking,
stacking
density
right.
Like
at
home,
if
you
dump
say
your
garments
one
over
other
right,
the
lowest
one
is
obviously ,
totally
gone
and
that
way
you
are
not
able
to
keep
your
garments
in
good
condition
for
long
time
right.
So,
here
also,
if
you
are
dumping
absolutely
with
full
volume
of
the
room,
then
there
will
be
very
difficult
for
the
air
to
circulate
and
the
temperature
to
be
maintained.
So,
these
things
that
come
in
and
you
have
to
look
into
in
detail
right.
So,
let
us
go
now
to
the
packaging
right.
So,
if
we
go
into
the
packaging,
the
first
thing
is
coming
as
vacuum
packaging
right.
3(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:54)
Vacuum
packaging
and
in
this
vacuum
packaging
what
you
do?
You
take
the
product
in
a
container .
Whatever
be
the
container ,
that
could
be
a
plastic
container .
Nowadays,
plastic
has
taken
up
even
though
it
should
not
be,
because
some
days
we
will
come
because
this
plastics
are
not
recyclable
as
well
they
are
not
biodegradable.
So,
the
soil
of
the
earth
is
getting
really
affected
badly
throughout
the
world.
So,
maybe
some
substitute
alternative
of
the
plastics
are
supposed
to
come
and
they
someday
will
be
developed
and
will
replace
these
present
status
but,
as
of
now
those
kind
of
plastics
if
they
are
there.
So,
what
is
happening
that
inside
whatever
content
is
there,
but
the
air
from
the
inside
is
sucked
off
right.
That
sucking
is
done
by
the
vacuum
pump
right
to
this
effect,
let
me
tell
you
there
are
primarily
2
types
of
vacuum
pumps
which
are
working
one
is
up
to
10
-3
or
that
is
normal
household
or
laboratory
or
commercial
where
your
vacuum
level
is
up
to
10
-3
torr.
But,
so,
I
hope
you
understand
torr
right
1
torr
is
1
millimeter
1
torr
is
yes
1
millimeter
of
mercury .
So,
1
torr
yes
so,
that
you
please
check
and
that
10
-3
torr
you
can
do
with
normal
rotary
vacuum
pump,
but
if
you
need
more
than
that
of
course,
for
this
food
application
you
do
not
need
that
is
good
enough.
4
But,
if
you
need
since
it
has
come,
there
are
some
diffusion
pumps
also
and
the
with
the
diffusion
pump
you
can
go
up
to
10
-6
mm
of
mercury
right
10
-6
torr.
You
can
go
to
that
level
and
this
high
vacuum
is
in
many
cases
required
for
leak
detection
and
others
right.
So,
you
have
a
pipeline
and
you
have
very
very
costly
gases
going
through
that
pipeline.
So,
if
there
is
some
leak,
you
are
losing
huge
amount
of
that
gases
which
are
costly .
So,
that
is
not
and
as
such
like
ammonia,
you
can
you
can
detect
easily
because
of
its
odor.
But,
in
many
cases,
there
is
no
like
Freon
there
is
no
chance
you
cannot
do
that
you
cannot
feel
that
if
Freon
is
getting
leaked
because
there
is
no
flavor ,
no
odor,
there
is
no
odor.
And,
since
it
is
odorless,
then
your
leak
is
very
difficult
to
recognize
or
identify
for
that
your
in
many
cases,
those
diffusion
pumps
are
used
right.
Say,
like
we
have
in
our
transgenic
center
one
called
diffusion
pump
or
10
-6
which
can
detect
that
leak
of
helium;
helium
gas
is
very,
very
costly .
So,
earlier
helium
is
to
be
produced
there.
So,
that
helium
gas
leak
detection
is
done
by
this
vacuum
or
diffusion
pump
right
ok.
We
have
deviated
a
little.
Let
us
come
back
again
to
vacuum
packaging
right.
So,
this
from
this,
we
see
that
vacuum
packaging
is
another
way
to
increase
the
shelf
life
of
the
product
and
here
the
product
is
placed
in
an
air
tight
pack.
The
air
is
sucked
out
and
package
is
sealed
by
removing
air
from
around
the
product.
The
levels
of
oxygen
in
the
packaging
are
reduced,
impeding
the
ability
of
oxygen
breathing
microor ganisms
to
grow
and
spoil
the
product.
The
lack
of
oxygen
also
reduces
the
amount
of
spoilage
due
to
oxidation
the
process
that
causes
apple,
banana
to
brown
or
for
example,
right.
So,
lot
of
things
we
have
said;
number
one,
you
are
removing
air
there
by
air
contains
21
%
oxygen
and
79
%
nitrogen
by
enlar ge
we
can
tell.
So,
out
of
that
21
%,
whatever
damage
is
being
done,
that
is
through
oxygen,
not
the
nitrogen.
So,
oxygen
when
you
are
removing
air,
you
are
also
removing
oxygen.
So,
when
you
are
sucking
of
that
air,
oxygen
is
depleting
and
moment
oxygen
getting
depleted,
there
are
organisms
which
we
have
said
earlier
that
it
could
be
aerobic
or
it
could
be
anaerobic
right.
There
is
facultative
and
many
others
like
that
can
grow
both
in
or
in
presence
or
in
absence.
So,
this
we
are
not
just
going
into
those
because
this
is
not
the
microbiology
class.
5So,
this
aerobic
organisms
they
require
oxygen
for
their
sustenance
as
well
as
growth
and
activity .
So,
when
you
have
removed
this
oxygen,
then
you
are
keeping
aside
or
you
are
throwing
those
organisms
out
because
they
will
not
be
able
to
survive
right.
That
is
one
step
which
you
have
taken
for
the
long
term
storage
of
the
material
you
have
packed.
So,
your
packet
is
now
there
is
no
oxygen
right
or
if
it
cannot
be,
where
to
no
oxygen
it
could
be
at
least
very
little
oxygen
which
is
not
sufficient
for
the
organisms
to
survive;
that
is
number
1.
Number
2,
that
as
we
have
said
earlier
also
that
when
you
cut
apple
or
potato
or
things
like
that,
then
what
is
happening?
They
are
getting
brown
right.
So,
that
browning
is
because
of
the
enzyme
in
presence
of
oxygen
or
oxidative
or
enzymatic
both
could
be
right.
So,
when
you
have
removed
these
oxygen
so,
oxidative
browning
you
are
or
oxidative
changes
oxidative
or
oxidation
you
are
removing
the
chance.
So,
you
are
protecting
your
food
material
by
2
ways
right.
So,
this
is
one
way
of
maintaining
of
long
time
or
packaging
material
with
vacuum,
you
are
extending
the
life
of
the
product
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:52)
So,
a
certain
amount
of
oxygen
will
remain
as
we
said
that
it
may
not
be
possible
to
clean
or
clear
all
the
oxygen
present;
so,
that
is
why
a
certain
amount
of
oxygen
will
remain.
However ,
because
it
is
not
possible
to
create
a
total
vacuum
ok
air
contains
around
21
%
oxygen
at
around
atmospheric
pressure
that
is
1000
millibar
as
the
air
is
6
withdrawn.
As
the
air
is
withdrawn
during
the
vacuum
packaging
process,
the
pressure
inside
the
package
is
reduced.
If
for
example,
the
pressure
is
reduced
to
100
millibar
and
equivalent
of
around
2.1
%,
oxygen
will
remain.
If
it
is
reduced
to
10
millibar ,
there
will
be
an
equivalent
of
0.21
%
of
oxygen
present.
So,
we
are
not
able
to
remove
entire
oxygen
right.
So,
depending
on
how
close
how
much
you
are
doing
your
vacuum
right,
we
gave
example
that
if
it
is
1000
millibar ,
if
it
is
21
%,
then
if
you
make
100
millibar ,
then
you
got
bringing
equivalent
to
2.1
%
of
oxygen.
If
you
are
making
10
millibar ,
that
is
vacuum
level
to
that
the
pressure
is
10
millibar ,
then
you
are
making
the
oxygen
equivalent
to
0.21
%.
If
you
are
making
1
millibar ,
then
you
are
making
equivalent
to
0.021
%
right.
So,
you
are
not
making
0
making
0
is
very
difficult.
So,
it
that
depends
on
to
what
extent
you
are
reducing
your
pressure
that
is
you
are
making
vacuum.
So,
that
will
dictate
how
much
you
have
oxygen
present
in
the
container .
However ,
the
smaller ,
the
better
it
is
right
is
vacuum
packaging
is
more
effective
than
modified
atmosphere
packaging.
This
is
a
question
which
I
am
throwing
to
you.
The
answer
should
be
that
as
with
most
things,
it
is
a
case
of
horses
for
courses.
This
is
said
that
that
racehorse
performs
based
on
a
racecourse
to
which
it
is
specifically
suited
right
it
depends
on
the
product
being
packaged.
So,
the
answer
to
this
is
that,
we
have
said
horses
for
courses;
that
is,
racecourse
performs
that
racecourse
horse
performs
best
on
a
racecourse
to
which
it
is
specially
suited
right.
Definitely ,
1
horse
in
a
1
racecourse
from
the
there
if
you
take
to
another
where
it
was
there
may
not
perform
to
that
right.
So,
depending
on
which
one
what
you
are
doing,
that
will
dictate
whether
vacuum
packaging
is
better
or
some
other
packaging
is
better
right.
So,
there
is
no
comparison
that
is
not
absolute
also
comparison
it
comes
always
because,
comparison
will
come
when
your
product
with
specific
the
cost
involvement
that
comes
in.
So,
if
the
cost
is
too
big,
definitely
even
though
the
quality
of
the
product
will
be
better
we
will
not
go
for
it
right.
So,
because,
I
ultimately
you
have
to
see
whether
the
7consumer
will
go
for
it;
that
is,
they
will
buy
or
not
otherwise
you
would
not
try
to
do
such
activities
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:51)
Then,
flushing
with
inert
gas
right;
this
is
done
in
most
of
the
cases,
as
I
gave
the
example
of
the
chips,
potato
chips
that
flushing
with
your
inert
gases.
That
is
one
of
the
best
packaging
right.
An
inert
gas,
the
most
available
inert
gas
is
the
nitrogen
gas
right
because,
that
is
the
most
suitable
one.
The
nitrogen
which
is
plenty
available
price
is
not
so
high.
So,
what
happens?
The
inside
of
the
packaging
material
the
air
is
purge.
This
is
called
purging;
air
is
purged
of
by
nitrogen.
And
as
I
said,
nitrogen
you
may
have
depending
on
the
purity
it
is
98
%
pure,
2
%
oxygen;
99
%
pure,
1
%
oxygen;
99.99
%
pure
0.01
%
oxygen.
The
one
which
you
need
for
your
laboratory
purposes
typically
for
HPLC
or
JC
or
things
like
that,
instruments
there
you
need
99.9999
%
of
purity
of
the
gas
right.
So,
they
are
oxygen
is
as
minimum,
but
price
is
also
very
high.
So,
you
have
to
compromise
between
the
price
availability
and
your
utility .
So,
in
that
case,
this
nitrogen
which
is
available
in
the
market
that
can
be
used
very
effectively ,
purging
the
air
and
you
can
produce
an
inert
atmosphere
right.
8
So,
let
us
look
into
that
that
flushing
with
inert
gas
that
benefits
what
nitrogen
is
an
inert
gas
and
is
used
as
a
filler
gas.
Because
of
it
is
insolubility
in
water ,
nitrogen
on
its
own
can
delay
oxidative
rancidity
in
low
water
activity
products.
Flushing
of
potato
crisps
with
nitrogen
is
said
to
increase
the
shelf
life
from
about
60
days
without
nitrogen
to
about
120
with
nitrogen,
another
advantage
of
nitrogen
flushing
is
that
uniform
pillow
packs
are
produced.
So,
pillow
packs
can
which
I
said
that
it
is
bulged.
So,
that
bulging
is
also
protecting
your
food
material
those
which
are
crispy ,
like
see,
if
the
get
some
kind
of
impact.
So,
that
will
break
that
which
may
not
be
sold
or
buyer
may
not
like
it
right.
So,
that
will
have
it
will
protect,
it
will
give
a
pillow
kind
of
protection
right
which
prevents
damage
of
the
fragile
snack
products
during
handling
and
distribution.
The
use
of
the
flushing
has
brought
improvements
in
the
barrier
properties
of
packaging
materials
and
in
seal
performance.
The
use
of
this
technique
has
been
shown
to
double
or
triple
the
shelf
life
of
these
products
right.
So,
flushing
with
nitrogen
is
definitely
beneficial,
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
shelf
life,
but
also
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
protecting
the
product
from
such
kind
of
impact
or
the
fragility
of
the
product
can
be
protected.
So,
we
today
discuss
this
2
packaging;
that
one
is
vacuum
and
another
is
the
flushing
right.
So,
in
the
next
class,
we
will
try
to
bring
some
other
and
this
is
of
course,
not
only
for
not
only
for
dairy
products,
but
also
for
any
solid
products
right.
Definitely
not
the
liquid
products;
normally ,
liquid
milk
is
not
is
normally
liquid
milk
is
not
packed
under
neither
vacuum
nor
with
nitrogen
right.
So,
there
their
game
plan
is
altogether
different,
ok.
So,
with
this,
we
finish
todayâ€™ s
class
because
time
is
up.
Thank
you.
