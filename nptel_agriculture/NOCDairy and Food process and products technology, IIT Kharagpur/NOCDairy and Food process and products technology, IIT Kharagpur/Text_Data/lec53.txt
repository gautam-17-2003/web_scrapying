So,
after
cheese
another
product
we
shall
discuss;
that
is
also
very
popular .

Ice
cream
right.
Ice
cream
is
also
one
very
popular
dairy
product
all
over
the
world.
And
it
will
be
very
very
good
to
say
that
our
ice
cream
consumption
in
our
country
is
very
much
bigger
very
very
less.
Whereas,
in
developed
countries
ice
cream
is
profoundly
used
right
it
is
really
in
very
very
good
quantity
they
consume,
per
capita
consumption
is
very
high
whereas,
in
our
country
per
capita
consumption
doesn’ t
come
into
any
whole
number
right.
Because
of
many
many
of
course,
many
many
reasons
for
that
primarily
because
of
the
cost.
Second
may
not
be
available
throughout
all
these
factors
are
there,
but
it
is
also
very
very
popular
and
very
ener gy
or
it
gives
it’ s
almost
a
complete
food.
So,
if
someone
is
a
hungry
and
it
requires
lot
of
ener gy
for
some
reason,
then
a
ice
cream
can
give
a
supplement
for
that
right.
So,
it
is
a
one
another
very
very
popular
dairy
product
and
we
shall
discuss
in
detail
of
the
ice
cream
manufacture
and
along
with
that,
it
may
take
couple
of
lectures
may
be
may
not
be
possible
in
the
one
two
lectures
maybe
a
3rd
lecture
could
be
required;
that
transportation
which
we
will
cover
not
only
a
for
ice
cream
that
will
cover
along
with
ice
cream
all
frozen
foods
so
how
they
are
transported.
In
typically
in
our
country
typically
frozen
food
is
primarily
associated
with
ice
cream
right.
In
all
these
big
stores
for
storages
they
are
mainly
for
ice
cream,
which
are
I
said
the
other
day
there
are
two
types
of
cold
storages,
one
is
the
above
0
and
another
is
below
0.
Above
0
there
is
also
primarily
for
potato
very
biggerly
for
other
fruits
and
vegetables.
Primary
lead
is
associated
with
potato
and
in
sub
0
again
it
is
primarily
associated
with
ice
cream
and
other
frozen
products
like
fish
meat,
they
are
not
so
much
in
our
country
right.
Generally
at
least
I
have
not
come
across
so
many
in
numbers
in
our
country;
however ,
it
is
getting
developed
today
or
tomorrow
see
more
in
numbers
we
will
come
up
and
not
only
icecream,
but
also
other
frozen
products
could
be
stored
in
those
big
big
warehouses
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
a
ice
cream
what
it
is
made
of
right.
Ice
cream,
what
it
is
made
of?
It
is
made
of
primarily
milk
fat,
milk
solid
not
fat,
sugar ,
stabilizers,
emulsifier ,
water ,
air
and
flavoring
and
coloring
compounds
right.
So,
and
the
composition
ranges
between
10
to
12
percent
of
fat,
1 1
to
13
percent
of
sugar ,
solid
not
fat.
Sugar
is
around
14
to
16
percent,
stabilizer
0.2
to
0.3
percent
and
emulsifier
0.1
to
0.2
percent.
Around
60
to
if
you
add
up
all
these,
you
will
see
the
total
solid
comes
to
around
36
to
40
percent.
So,
remaining
is
water
around
60
to
64
percent
of
water
and
around
90
to
105
percent
of
air .
This
is
primarily
we
will
also
talk
about
why
so
much
of
air
and
why
not
that
we
will
talk
about
afterwards.
And
some
flavoring
and
coloring
materials
they
are
added.
This
flavoring
and
coloring
material
which
are
added
this
is
primarily
dependent
on
the
company .
Because
that
is
the
secret
of
the
company
normally
it
is
not
divulge
a
because
how
much
flavour
how
much
color
is
given
that
is
the
secret
of
the
company .
However ,
some
flavours
some
colors
are
required
and
that
is
why
we
say
normally
ice
cream
is
not
possible
to
manufacture
in
house
right,
because
you
have
seen
one
of
the
major
component
is
air
right.
So,
there
is
a
saying
between
the
workers
of
the
ice
cream
industry
and
the
cold
drinks
industry
they
fight
like
this
that,
one
says
that
you
only
feed
people
hawa
that
is
air
and
the
other
say
that
you
earn
money
only
selling
the
pani
that
is
water
right.
So,
this
is
the
fight
between
them.
So,
major
one
is
air
and
since
at
home
when
you
prepare
ice
cream
this
incorporation
of
air
is
not
possible
not
feasible;
that
is
why
at
home
when
you
prepare
that
is
not
the
ice
cream,
but
air
some
frozen
product
frozen
dessert
that
can
be
said,
but
not
the
ice
cream
right.
Now
with
these
constituents
what
does
they
do
right,
What
the
constituents
do.
So,
milk
fat
is
that
is
the
source
is
your
cream
or
butter ,
it
is
around
10
to
12
percent
and
out
of
which
80
percent
is
fat.
And
the
purpose
is
to
improve
the
flavour
and
it
produces
characteristics
smooth
texture.
I
hope
you
have
taken
butter
and
when
you
take
butter;
obviously ,
you
feel
that
there
is
a
very
smooth
smelling
in
your
mouth
right
in
your
mouth
you
feel
that
there
is
a
smooth
smelling.
And
this
smooth
smelling
is
primarily
because
of
the
fat
right
and
that
is
why
when
you
are
making
ice
cream
this
adds
up
to
the
smoothness
of
the
texture
of
the
product
that
is
ice
cream
right.
But
everything
has
some
advantage
and
some
disadvantage.
So,
if
you
only
talk
about
advantage
that
is
not
desirable.
So,
it
also
has
some
disadvantages
like
it
retards
whipping
rate
and
also
it
makes
high
calorific
value
and
maybe
it
is
adding
cholesterol
to
your
blood
stream.
Of
course,
the
other
day
I
also
said
that,
nowadays
that
cholesterol
concept
is
getting
also
a
little
change,
but
even
then
the
calorific
value
is
very
high.
So,
if
the
calorific
value
is
very
high
because
of
the
fact
then
because
now
all
over
the
world
that
people
are
becoming
conscious
about
the
self
physic
and
in
that
people
are
now
consuming
fat
less
so
that
is
one
of
the
disadvantage.
The
other
one
which
we
said
it
retards
the
whipping
ability
right
here
lies
the
answer
to
that
which
you
said
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
produce
at
home
ice
cream.
Because
this
whipping
ability
is
not
possible
or
whipping
is
not
possible
at
home.
Y ou
will
say
that
when
you
are
making
ah
omelet
from
egg
that
time
you
beat
for
a
longer
period.
And
there
also
you
are
incorporating
air
right,
air
is
being
introduced
into
that.
That
is
why
it
becomes
fluf fy
that
omelet
becomes
a
little
fluf fy
but
only
that
much.
Here
you
need
100
percent
air ,
so
that
much
incorporation
of
air
by
beating
is
not
possible
right.
And
this
fat
is
retarding
that
whipping
ability
so
that
is
one
disadvantage
of
the
fat
which
you
are
adding
right.
Next
is
milk
solid
not
fat
which
is
around
1 1
to
13
percent
generally
it
comes
from
the
protein
or
lactose
or
minerals
all
put
together
is
for
being
milk
solid
not
fat.
And
the
source
is
source
is
from
the
milk
solids
that
is
dry
milk,
skim
milk;
where
fat
is
already
removed.
Purpose
is
it
provides
food
value
improves
palatability
and
texture
it,
but
it
also
resists
melting
right.
So,
this
resists
melting
sometimes
it
may
be
good,
sometimes
it
may
be
bad,
it
depends
on
how
you
are
looking
from
which
a
side
which
angle
you
are
looking
into
it.
Resist
melting
may
be
helpful
when
you
are
keeping
it
for
storage
that
time
if
the
melting
is
resisted,
then
you
are
better
of f
that
ice
cream
product
can
be
kept
for
longer
period,
if
the
resistance
is
there
for
melting.
But
the
reverse
you
consider
you
have
taken
a
chunk
of
ice
cream
through
some
spoon
put
it
in
your
mouth.
And
I
hope
you
have
also
tested
ice
crystals
during
your
childhood
so
we
have
put
it
in
your
mouth
and
the
ice
cube
is
not
getting
melted
right.
If
that
happens
with
the
ice
cream,
even
not
like
that
because
you
want
the
moment
you
have
put
the
scoop
of
ice
cream
with
maybe
spoon
right.
So,
that
you
have
put
in
your
mouth
and
it
should
be
melted
there.
So,
if
it
is
resisting
if
milk
solid
not
fat
is
resisting
to
that,
so
this
is
not
desirable.
So,
it
depends
from
which
angle
you
are
looking
at,
but
milk
solid
not
fat
is
resisting
the
melting
that
is
the
advantage.
Y ou
let
us
look
from
this
angle
now
that
is
the
advantage;
but
there
are
some
disadvantages
also.
Because
from
the
law
of
Raoults
law
you
know
that
as
the
concentration
of
solutes
are
increasing
that
is
lowering
the
freezing
point
or
depression
of
freezing
point
or
increasing
the
boiling
point
occur
that
is
by
Raoults
law .
So,
here
you
are
adding
milk
solid
not
fat,
so
that
is
increasing
the
solid
content
so
the
corresponding
freezing
point
also
will
be
lowered.
So
the
moment
you
were
your
freezing
point
is
getting
lowered,
so
more
quantity
of
refrigeration
may
be
required,
so
that
is
adding
to
your
cost
that
is
the
disadvantage
right.
So,
disadvantage
is
that
it
is
lowering
freezing
point
and
causes
salty
taste
and
sandiness.
This
salty
test
because
of
the
minerals
present
inthe
lactose;
in
the
milk
solid
not
fat
right.
So,
then
it
is
the,
what
it
does?
The
what
do
the
constituents
do?
If
these
are
the
some
milk
solid
not
fat
so
other
constituents
are
like
this.
Sugar;
sugar
it
is
around
14
to
16
percent
and
the
source
is
from
the
sucrose
which
you
come
which
you
take
every
day .
That
sugar
which
you
call
chini
or
whatever
right
that
is
the
sucrose
that
is
the
source
right.
Now ,
it’ s
purpose
is
to
make
ice
cream
sweet
also
it
improves
some
flavor .
When
sugar
is
added
it
also
adds,
it
also
it
is
like
that
it
is
addendum
it
is
improving
the
flavour
right.
But
it
also
has
some
defect
or
disadvantage
that
it
lowers
the
whipping
ability
that
is
again
like
the
earlier
one
this
is
also
whipping
ability
is
lowered.
So,
that
means
that
to
incorporate
air
you
have
to
have
more
ener gy
or
you
have
to
struggle
for
that,
and
also
increase
the
freezing
time.
Because
again
from
that
Raoult’ s
law
it
comes
into
that
sugar
is
the
solid.
So,
the
moment
solid
content
is
going
up,
so
increase
the
freezing
time
and
as
well
lowering
of
the
freezing
point
right.
Also
the
another
disadvantage
is
that
it
lowers
the
hardening
temperature
another
new
term
has
come
hardening
temperature.
Now ,
I
hope
many
of
you
have
gone
to
dif ferent
malls
and
seen
that
softies
are
available
in
dif ferent
counters
right.
Y ou
go
and
give
money
and
they
give
you
softy
maybe
in
cones
or
cups
or
whatever
but
that
is
very
soft.
Now
if
you
want
to
bring
that
softy
for
your
relative
maybe
mummy
or
sisters
or
brothers;
from
that
point
to
your
house
maybe
it
will
take
some
half
an
hour
to
1
hour
or
couple
of
hours.
So,
that
time
this
softy
should
not
melt
but
since
it
is
soft,
it
has
flow
ability
and
since
it
is
in
atmosphere
outside
hot.
So,
it
will
melt
you
will
not
be
able
to
bring
it
back
to
her
home
right.
So,
that
is
one
disadvantage
that
you
cannot
transport
the
ice
cream
to
or
softy
from
one
place
to
other
place.
Now
in
order
to
transport
it
from
that
production
point
to
warehouse
unless
it
is
hard,
you
can
handle
if
it
is
soft
you
cannot
handle
unless
it
is
hard
which
you
can
handle
you
will
not
be
able
to
transport.
So,
this
soft
ice
cream
is
hardened
it’ s
typically
hard
and
made
solid
and
that
solid
you
can
handle
and
transport
from
one
place
to
other
place
very
easily
right.
So,
another
disadvantage
with
the
sucrose
or
sugar
is
that,
it
is
lowering
the
hardening
temperature.
So,
if
the
hardening
temperature
is
lowered
it
means
you
have
to
supply
more
refrigeration
means
your
price
or
cost
is
going
up
right
this
is
disadvantage.
But
you
cannot
avoid
you
have
to
have
sugar
and
obviously ,
this
sugar
will
impart
this
disadvantage,
which
you
have
to
overcome
right.
Then
stabilizers,
stabilizers
are
used
that
you
are
incorporating
air
are
subsequently .
This
air
should
not
come
out
right;
in
that
cold
drinks
there
also
you
have
seen
that
you
know
that
carbon
dioxide
is
incorporated
into
the
drink.
And
carbon
dioxide
gets
solubilized
into
the
drink,
when
the
temperature
is
low;
because
this
gas
absorption
is
a
function
of
the
temperature.
The
lower
the
temperature
it
will
be
more,
the
higher
the
that
is
why
the
drinks
you
bring
you
keep
it
in
the
freeze
or
in
cold
condition
so
that
the
carbon
dioxide
is
incorporated
and
retains.
But
if
it
is
in
outside,
then
it
will
come
out
and
stay
on
this
above
because
you
will
see
in
all
the
cold
drinks
there
is
some
space
headspace.
So,
that
air
space
is
to
accommodate
the
evolved
carbon
dioxide
right.
So,
here
your
air
is
incorporated
into
ice
or
ice
cream
rather ,
so
in
that
if
air
is
not
retained
you
will
not
feel
the
taste
of
the
ice
cream.
So,
to
make
it
stabilize
that
stabilizer
is
added
right.
So,
function
of
the
stabilizer
is
to
stabilize
the
product,
particularly
the
air
texture
air
composition
air
inside
that
is
the
primary
reason
for
adding
stabilizer .
Stabilizers
definitely
they
have;
stabilizer
coming
afterwards
ok.
Emulsifier
is
another
one
which
you
are
adding
around
0.2
percent
and
normally
by
monosodium
glutamate
normally
by
Mono
or
Di
Glycerides
or
sometimes
glutamates
are
also
used
Mono
or
Di
Glycerides.
This
increase
the
quality
whipping
quality
and
gives
drier
and
smoother
ice
cream
distributes
air
cell
uniformly
right.But
disadvantage
is
that,
it
causes
melting
and
textural
defects
in
the
ice
cream
melting
is
hampered.
So,
the
same
thing
when
you
are
putting
in
your
mouth
if
that
is
not
getting
melted,
you
will
feel
bad
so
that
is
not
desirable
right,
then
as
we
said
and
as
apart
from
that
this
emulsifier
also
helps
the
fat
to
be
trapped
otherwise
fat
will
come
up
and
that
will
not
be
because
you
have
also
around
for
60
percent
water .
So,
that
water
with
the
fat
they
should
be
together
this
emulsifier
helps
to
hold
the
fat
in
that
right.
Then
stabilizers
which
we
have
already
said
around
0.2
to
0.3
normally
sodium,
alginate
or
gelatin
or
agar
agar
they
are
used
is
purpose
is
to
prevent
coarsening
under
fluctuating
condition
or
fluctuating
temperature
right.
This
coarsening
I
would
like
to
highlight
that
coarsening
is
happening
that
if
you
keep
you
in
your
house
number
of
times
you
take
out
from
the
deep
freeze
something
and
put
it
back
and
again
bring
it
outside
and
putting
back,
then
you
will
see
that
you
will
feel
some
salty
or
some
sand
like
test
in
the
product
right.
So,
here
also
when
ice
cream
is
kept
in
the
dif ferent
parlors,
dif ferent
shopping
malls
or
shopping
centers,
the
ice
cream
is
kept
in
a
freezer
deep
freezer
suppose
to.
Where
the
temperature
is
supposed
to
be
minus
20
around
right.
And
in
most
of
the
cases
you
see
that
the
top
of
the
container
is
open
people
are
addressing
people
are
going
and
looking
into
their
product
desired
product
and
thereby
it
is
outside
is
20,
22
degree
though
air
conditions,
but
not
lower
than
20
degree
centigrade.
So,
it
is
lot
which
is
there
and
you
cannot
force
people
to
close
that
container
result
ice
cream
is
becoming
gradually
warm.
So,
when
it
is
getting
warm
and
warm,
some
melting
of
the
water
is
taking
place.
And
when
again
in
the
night
time
again
for
10,
12
hour
it
is
under
close
condition
again
it
is
getting
refrozen.
So,
this
thaw
and
freezing
process
is
melting
is
making
the
ice
crystal
bigger
and
this
is
the
defect
of
the
ice
cream
that.
That
coarsening
of
the
ice
cream
or
ice
is
happening
which
will
be
felt
by
your
mouth
when
you
are
putting
it.
So,
this
is
a
disadvantage
that
it
when
you
are
keeping
it
in
the
deep
freezer
it
should
not
be
oh
kept
open,
but
your
stabilizer
is
helping
to
prevent
that
coarsening
right.
So,
it
also
as
some
disadvantage,
that
is
it
causes
heavy
and
soggy
body
and
resists
melting
right.
So,
since
it
is
here
preventing
coarsening
so
that
is
also
resisting
melting.
So,
the
same
example
or
same
explanation
happens
that
you
are
putting
in
your
mouth
and
it
is
not
getting
melted
so
that
is
not
desirable.
Since
water
and
air
purpose
is
to
increase
the
volume,
here
water
is
for
the
composition,
but
air
is
to
increase
the
volume
right.
So,
if
you
see
the
if
you
take
a
cup
of
ice
cream
maybe
you
it
will
cost
you
10
rupees
20
rupees
depending
on
what
you
were
taking,
but
take
it
once
and
allow
it
to
melt
completely
right.
And
the
cup
if
it
is
a
50
ml
cup,
then
you
will
see
after
melting
totally
it
has
become
volume
has
become
almost
half
around
25
ml.
So,
rest
was
air
so
which
got
escaped
after
melting
right.
So,
this
air
is
added
to
the
product.
So,
it
is
increasing
the
volume
right,
but
again
some
disadvantage
that
volume
is
there
weight
is
less,
but
increases
the
transportation
and
storage
cost
because
lot
of
spacing
need
right.
So,
that
is
increasing
your
cost
both
transport
as
well
as
storage
right.
Some
flavoring
and
coloring
materials
are
used,
fruits
and
nuts
and
permitted
flavours
artificial
flavours
are
used
for
that
and
some
it
increases
the
acceptability .
But
disadvantage
if
it
is
excess,
then
the
a
harsh
flavour
may
reduce
the
acceptability
in
because
of
the
intense
flavour
satisfies
your
satiety
or
desired
quickly
right.
Same
some
color
is
all
flavour
is
added
some
color
is
also
added.So,
that
color
is
company
secret,
but
advantage
is
that
it
permits
food
colors
permitted
food
colors
are
added
suppose
to,
but
it
in
also
improves
the
acceptability
and
it
also
aids
in
identifying
the
flavour .
So,
someone
is
the
red
colored
so
that
may
be
pineapple
or
that
may
be
tutti
frutti
or
some
other
butterscotch
or
some
to
identify
that
this
color
code
may
also
help.
So,
with
this
let
us
stop
today
that
the,
what
it
is
made
of
ice
cream
and
what
the
constituents
do
we
have
explained
in
detail
ok.
Thank
you.
