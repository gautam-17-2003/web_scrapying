Frozen
Foods
So,
you
are
in,
discussing
for
overrun
of
ice
cream.
Now,
today’s
in
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology57th
class,
we
will
discuss
on
Transportation
of
Ice
Creamor
in
general
Frozen
Foods.
So,
any
frozen
foods
come
under,
thatwhether
it
is
ice
cream
orfrozen
food
does
not
matter.
They
come
under
the
same
umbrella,
because
all
are
frozen,
right.So,
transportation,
we
can
call
it
to
be
transportation
of
frozen
food,
but
before
thatI
would
like
to
also
highlightthat,
how
muchrefrigeration
loadyou
have
to
calculate,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:03)
For
preparation
of
ice
cream,
how
much
refrigeration
load
you
need
this
is
like
that,
that
productssensible
heat
is
there
and
that
is

So,
these
twobrings
togetherhow
much
joules
of
or
kilojoules
ofrefrigeration
and
this
when
term
comes
in
terms
ofper
second
or
hour.
So,
that
becomes
watt;
so,
how
much
kilowattof
load
you
areto
deal
with
that
you
can
simply
calculate,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
02:24)
I
also
said
another
thing
that
we
need
to
knowthat,
before
this,
of
course,
here
I
have
not
perhaps
given,
but
let
me
tell
that,
there
is
a
proof
sheet
which
I
was
referring
to,
I
had
deleted
that,
because
of
time
constraint.
So,
this
kind
ofproof
sheet
theyprepared,
right.
This
is
like,
thisyour
items
are
like
that,
say
here
your
sugar,
right
you
needsay
12
%
sugar,
rightand
it
has
a
solid.
So,
here
your
total
solidmust
be
balanced.
So,
12
%
sugar
your,
solid
not
fat,
that
do
considertheir ,
yourthis
is
the
12
%
solid
or,
12
%
solid;
so,
that
12
comes
here
should,
it
should
be
here
somewhere,
because
here
it
is
fatnormally
and
here
it
is
solid
and
here,
it
is
the
total
solid
like
thatthey
have
distribution.
So,
in
that
SNFmay
have
say
0.5
%fatmaybe
say
9
percent,
solid
like
that
this
total
solid
balance.
Here,
total
solid
balancethese
two
together
is
given
and
they
make
a
proof
sheetwhich
looks
like
this
to
this
total
solid
is
knownthis,
how
much
they
have
tofill
that,
ok.
Let
me,
how
much
they
have
to
fill,
that
they
should
knowwith
the
proof
sheet,
that
you
make
sugar.
2
So
much
solid
not
fat,so
much
stabilizer
so
much
emulsifier;so
much
then
the
milkif
required.
So
much
all
these
must
be
knownto
them
and
this
is
called
a
proof
sheet,this
proof
sheet
they
do
have
this,
yourworkers
do
haveand
they
bring
accordingly
and
they
will
say,
because
you
being
the
senior
and
you
being
thehierarchy ,they
will
ask
and
tell
you
that,
yes
you
have
told
that,
this
much
has
to
be
there
this
much
has
to
be
there,
this
much
has
to
be
therewe
have
made
this
much,
this
much.
So,
it
is
absolutelyand
matchingthis
proof
sheet
they
should
have,
ok.
Now,
we
go
for
transportation
before
that,
I
was
sayingregarding
the
types
of
freezers
or
freezing
quick
freezing
or
slow
freezing
with
respect
to
cryo-freezing,
where
you
see
your
temperature
isgetting
droppedas
so
sharply
you
seetimes
in
seconds
or
minutes
depending
onwhat
you
are
doing.Whereas,
in
mechanical
refrigerationthis
changeover
is
taking
place
aroundsay
-2
or
-5and
you
are
coming
up
to
-23
so,
-23
or
-50,
whatever
yourtemperature.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:51)
So,
it
is
taking
hours,
right.
It
is
taking
hours.
So,
that
is
why
quick
freezingand
slow
freezing
is
different
quick
and
slow
freezing
are
quite
different,
in
this
respectmechanical
is,
slow
freezingand
cryo
is
quick
freezing,
right.So,
this
we
keep
in
mindthe
and
the
momentwe
have
the
slow
and
quick
freezing.And,since
it
is
out
ofplace
I
am
not
able
to
tell
thedetail
on
freezing,
but
in
that
small,
small
crystals
are
being
formed
in
quick
freezingfor
which
that
911
mattercomes
in,
whereas,
in
slow
freezing
bigger,
bigger
crystals
are
being
formed
you
see
for
from
a
liquid
to
a
solid
when
you
are
accommodating
such
a
huge
volume.3
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:03)
Then
the
surrounding
cells
are
getting
damaged
or
deformed
and
many
cases
it
may
getruptured
also
and
for
that
you
are
losing
theliquid
in
terms
of
that
is
called
yourthis
loss
is
called
drip
lossright.
So,
that
drip
loss
is
more
in
terms
ofmechanical
compared
toyou
know
the
cryo,
ok.
So,
from
that
let
us
go
intothe
transportationof
frozen
food.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:06)
Now,
in
transport
frozen
food
a
concept
of
a
concept
of
cold
chainhas
to
be
there.
Right
now,
this
cold
chain
concept
in
our
countryis
yet
to
yet
to
look
into,
because
till
now
there
is
no
4
such
cold
chain?
All
over
the
country
or
even
part
of
the
countryonly
this
cold
chain
is
maintained
for
the
product
calledice
cream
where
there
is
no
other
wayhad
it
been
that
ice
cream
could
have
been
without
cold
chain.
Our
country
would
have
beenirrespective
of
quality
of
theproduct,
butsince
ice
cream
if
it
is
under
high
temperature,
it
will
get
melted.
So,
that
is
whythis
cold
chain
is
in
ice
cream
industry,
but
not
in
any
other
industry,
that
awhether
it
isfrozen,
food
or
any,
but
cold
chain
is
not
there
it
is
always
a
disrupted
one.So,
in
cold
chain
what
do
you
need
that
this
is
your,
the
productionright
bulk
handling,
where
you
have
been
producingthat
is
stored
at
very
low
temperaturesupposed
to
around
-
30.
Then
it
is
going
through
bulk
transport
to
one
placewhere
it
is
being
stored
at
say
24-25°C.
Depending
on
the
temperature
then
from
there
it
is
going
to
another
placewhere
the
distributor
or
depocould
be
there
then
from
there
it
is
going
to
another
local
placeand
there,
it
has
to
be
always-18
or
below.This
is
supposed
to
that
-18or
below
degree
centigradehas
to
be
kept
all
overright,
all
through
has
to
be
-18
or
below,
but
fortunately
this
cold
chain
is
only
possiblein
ice
cream,
but
not
to
eat
any
other
product.However ,
when
it
is
being
with
ice
cream
then
how
this
is
being
maintainedfrom
my
practicalpoint
of
view
I
can
share
with
you
that.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
10:54)
5
I
can
share
with
you
that,
if
suppose
your
production
is
being
held
herethis
is
a
place
called
say
Pand
if
your
consumer
or
distributor
ishere
right
and
if
this
distance
is
say
around
1
to
2
kilometre
with
all
possible
things.Because,your
ice
cream
is
at
-20
or
belowrightand
there
in
big-big
contacts,
likeas
I
said
that
50
ml
cups
are
with
24
cups
in
a
packand
100
ml,
100
ml
cups
are12,
cups
in
a
pack
right,
in
a
paper
cartonthey
are
usedright
or
4
litre,
on
eachor
1literpacts
are
there.
So,
all
are
at-20
or
belowright.
So,
whatthey
doif
it
is
within
1,
2
km
and
suppose
from
here
some
100
kg,
they
have
loadedand
this
loading
time
may
be
around
10
to
15
minutesand
this
transportation
time
maybe
another
10
to
15
minutes.
So,
within
30
minutes;
this
-20willgo
up
to
say
-15and
then
in
this
area
cold
store,
they
have
a
cold
store
which
is
-20
or
less.
So,
they
are
dumped
into
thisand
this
-15
again,
gradually
goes
up
that
is
why
I
said,
if
you
remember
that
freeze
thaw
cyclethat
remainsand
this
makes
the
ice
crystal
sizebigger.
And
your
mouth
filling
is
bad.
You
always
feel
that
is
sandy
-sandy
appearance
is
there
in
the
product
which
is
not
desirable
this
is,
because
of
this
freeze
thaw
cycle;
that
means,
you
are
warmingand
then
it
is
cooling
warming
and
cooling.This
is
more
prevalent
in
the
sellerspoint
a
sellers
point
means
suppose
you
are
going
into
multiplex
there
you
will
see
thatthisfreezer
container
is
always
open
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
lead,
but
this
lead
is
always
openwhereas,
the
room
temperature
is
say
plus
instead
of
-20the
room
temperature
is
say
plus
20right
So,
in
that
case
what
will
happen
say,
if
this
is
an
ice
creamthe
surface
they
will
getmelted,
right.
They
will
get
melted
andagain,
when
it
is
coming
in
the
night
when
everything
is
closed.
So,
that
time
it
is
getting
represent.
So,
like
that,
once
it
is
getting
melted
and
again
it
is
getting
frozen.
So,
that
is
forming
the
ice
crystal
size
big
and
bigand
you
get,
filling
in
your
mouth
that
you
are
taking
some
sand
though
there
is
no
sand,
right.This
is,
the
defect
of
the
maintenance
of
the
continuity
of
the
cold
chaineverywhere
right,
and
for
that
what
is
the
most
required
thing
is
the
awareness
among
the
consumer
also,
not
only
to
the
productionI
tell
you
that
the
manufacturers
for
their
safety,
they
always
try
to
keep
it
at
low
temperature.
In
many
cases,
it
may
not
be
feasible,
because
in
very
high
warm
condition
typically
say
in
Bombay,
where
it
is
almost
throughout
the
year
it
is
warmand,
it
is
and
almost
throughout
the
year
there
is
demand,
because
the
hot
it
is
the
demand
is
more,
that
is
why
maybe
in
Delhi
or
in
very
cold
places
thedemand
is
not.So,
during
the
winter
then
that
in
the
summerright
so,
but
in
Bombay
it
is
not
beclimate
is
such
that
all
thetime
it
is
hot
rather
and
ice
cream
6demand
is
very
high
for
which
the
maintenance
of
the
cold
room
may
not
be
at
-20
sometimes
it
goes
higher.
But,that
is
adebatableright
debatable
why,
because
somebodywho
arereally
working
they
will
always
claimno
it
is
not,
butin
act
practice
in
actual
it
is.So,right;
so,
this
is
the
reality,
but
the
thing
is
you
are
supposed
to
keep
it
at-20
or
below
there
is
a
must.
Otherwise,
that
freeze
thaw,
these
cyclewill
go
on
and
that
is
not
desirable
for
the
productright.
So,
how
they
are
then
transported
number
one
is
only
in
plane
vansas
we
saidplane
vans
if
the
if
the
distance
is
very
low,
very-very
smalland,
if
it
is
only
one
time.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:48)
So,
from
one
place
to
another
place
within
1,
2
kilometre,
then
they
may
be
taken
just
like
that
in
any,
in
any
container
or
any
van,
right
who
had
just
the
keep
it
in
thereandfrom
one
place
to
another
place
dump.
Second
isthrough
insulated
vanmay
be
that
distance
is
not
1,
2
kilometres,
maybe
5,
10
kmand,
and
maybe
not
only
in
one
place,
but
also
in
2-3
places
they
have
to
go.So,
what
they
do;
so,
they
load
it
athere,
at
around
-
20.
That
come
the,
the
product
temperature,
then
go
here
may
be
atsay
5
kmfrom
thereandmaybe
if
they
had
taken
four
100
kg
materialright.
So,200
kg
is,
isremoved
from
there
or
an
unloaded
here
and
another
200
kgto
another,
5
kilometres.
So,
there
they
areunloadingright.
So,
this
if
it
istaken
an
insulated
vanmaybe
that
willlast
way
from
-
20.
Again,
it
may
come
to
-
14
15
degree
centigradeand
which
again
in
the
cold
room
7
at
this
placeor
at
that
place.
We
will
again
go
up,
but
this
freeze
thaw
cycle,
that
will
remain.Third
one
could
bethat
insulated
van
with
mechanical
on-board
refrigerationright.
This
is
one,
such
unit
mechanical
on
board
refrigeration
that
this
refrigeration
unit
is
over
the
driver's
cabinand
the
evaporator
is
inside
the
cabinet.
This
is
theclose
insulated
cabinet.
So,
that
evaporator
there
is
a
fan.
This
fanis
circulating
the
cold
air
and
the
whole
thing
isdumped
with
ice
creamright.
So,
this
fan
will
make
the
circulation
of
the
cold
air
throughoutand
maintain
the
temperatureat
around
-
20
or
belowright.There
this
is
the
rear,
that
rear
there
is
a
doorand
that
door
is
there
is
a
small
window
also
in
this
door
there
is
a
there
is
an
antiroom
here
alsothere
is
an
anteroom.
So,
when
from
the
if
say
this
is
the
cold
room
from
there
it
goes
here
to
the
anteroom
some
loader
is
here.
So,
he
takes
it
to
gives
it
to
the
fellow
hereand
through,
open
small
window.
These
things
are
again
inside
there
is
another
personwho
is
going
all
around
and
loading
right.
So,
once
the
entire
thing
is
loadedright;
obviously,
there
will
be
some,
small
areas
through
whichair
can
pass
and
this
circulation
of
fan
willkeep
the
material
throughoutat
-
20
or
below
supposed
to,
because
this
is
on
board.
This
is
getting
electricity
from
the
driverscabin
from
the
engine,
from
the
engine
it
is
getting
the
electricity
andthe
compressor
is
continuously
runningas
and
when
required
to
maintainthat
-
20
or
below
temperatureright.
So,
during
loading
unloading
period,
this
temperature
may
go
up.
So,
after
some
time
when
this
is
running,
this
againgoes
downright.
So,
this
is
one
and
this
is
for
large
distance
or
if
the
ifit
has
a
1000
kg,
somewhere
you
have
to
give
100
kg
at
one
place
maybe
say
100
kilometre
away,
you
have
to
give
100
kg.
So,
another
50
kilometre
awayyou
give
another
250
kg.
So,
like
thatif
you
have
to
go
door
to
doorat
different
placesthen
this
on-board
refrigeration
helps
you
to
maintain
the
temperatureright.
This
is
one
way
how
things
are
being
doneright
and
make
this
is
a
mechanical,
but
since
this
is
a
mechanical
system
there
isonly
one
risk
is
that,
because
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
mechanical
system.So,
it
may
go
longon
the
way,
but
generally
people
who
handle
it,
they
are
good
enough
to
repair
it.
This
then
unless
it
is
beyond
repairright
andthat
circulation
ofair
inside
the
cabinet
inside
that,
insulated
van
this
is,
insulated
this
is
these
are
the
insulation.
This
is
a
good
insulation
is
thereand,
there
is
no
other
pipeline
or
other
thingright
there
is
no
other
pipeline
other
thanthe
fan
and
the
evaporator
of
behind
the
evaporator ,
there
is
a
fan
8that
fanblows
and
that
cold
air
gets
circulated
as
the
arrow
it
is
being
shownright.
Andthere
are
some
other
this
is
a
mechanical
oneright
now,
imaginethat
you
do
not
have
this
uniton
the
board
right,
you
do
not
have
that
unit
on
the
board,
but
here
on
the
ceiling
you
have
someall
through
the
ceilingsome
sheets
like
thisright.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:14)
This
is
called
holdover,
holdover
refrigerationright
where
brine
solutions,brine
solutions
are
inside
that,
tubes
and,
and
before
the
commencement
of
the
journeyovernight
this
is
being
cooled
through
anotherheat
exchanger
or
through
anthrough
another
refrigeration
system
where
this
holdover
platesare
getting
frozenand
it
is
around
-
20or
below
temperaturethere
right.
So,
only
the
thingthat
you
needto,
continuously
supply
the
electricity,
that
can
be
from
point
to
point
right.
So,
there
you
are
not
carrying
this,
there
you
are
not
carrying
this
along
with
youright.

(Refer
Slide
Time:

So,
this
is
another
and
that
is
called
eutectichold
overright
achaor
there
are
some
Eutectic
Pads
also
pad
vaneutectic
pad
vans
the
pads
are
like
thismaybe
1centimetre,
sorry
1
meter
by
1
meter
maybe
by2
inches.
So,
there
is
one
opening
here;
so,
inside
that
eutectic
solution
is
put
and
this
isagain
like
the
drain
tank
of
the
earlier
we
have
shown,
seen
with
the
lolly
those
kinds
of
tanks
are
there.
So,
they
are
there
is
a
holder.
So,
that
is
dipped
into
that
and
this
is
getting
frozenright.
And
then
they
put
it
in
shippers,
say,
one
and
half
meter,
by
half
meterby
this
could
be
another
meter
by
one
meter.
So,
another
this
kind
of
thingand
these
units
are
placed
here.So,
they
then
serve
as
the,
this
refrigeration
sourceand
there
is
a
topwhich
is
covered
and
this
is
called
shippers.
Shippersright
and
these
shippers
are
then
taken
into
either
insulated
van
or
non-insulated
van
also.

(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:12)
So,
another
thing
whichnot
in
our
country
in
other
countries
that
is
called
polar
stream
in
our
country
it
is
not
yetBOC
triedBritish
oxygen
company
they
tried,
but,
could
notsucceed
the
one
of
the
failure
resonances
theavailability
and
price
of
liquid
nitrogenright.
This
is
an
again
your
liquid
nitrogen
cylinders
are
being
kepton
the
board
behindbetween
the
trailer
this
is
a
trailer
system.So,between
the
cabinet
and
the
drivers
cabin
they
are
keptand
there
is
all
over
the
pipeline
through
which
and
there
is
a
three-way
valvethere,
there
is
a
three-way
valve.
So,
that
opens
and
closeas
and
when
there
is
a
sensor.
Sensor
senses
the
temperature
and
opens
it
and
liquid
goesthere,
gets
agree
spreadand,
this
spraying
takes
place
and
since,1cc
of
liquid
nitrogenwhen
it
is
converted
into
gas
makes
around
800
cc
of
gas.
So,
a
lot
of
expansion
takes
place
and
then
the
expansion
there
is
without
any
fan.
These
circulating
inside
thoroughlyright;so,
this
is
called
Polar
Stream.
11
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:45)
So,
the
way
it
towards
that,
we
can
show
ithere,
that
it
is
like
thatyou
are
1
cylinder
2
3
4
as
many
cylinders
are
there
they
are
interconnected.
So,
this
is
connected
to
this,
three
way
valveand
which
is
controlling
the
flow
right
and
as
this
is
getting
emptyliquid
from
the
air
is
coming
as
it
is
getting
empty
liquid
from
there.And
in
turn
from
the
air
select,
that
this
from
herethen
this
from,
there
then
this
from
therethis
transfer
is
getting
on
and
you
cancarry
for
an
very-very
long
timeright.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:31)
12
So,
there
are
some
other
techniques
also
by
which
it
is,
that
is
called
this
kind
of
where
in
earlier
case
there
was
no
fan,
but
people
have
seenif
fans
are
also
used
then;
obviously,
there
will
be
forced
circulationand
forced
heat
transfer
is
much-much
better
than
unforced
heat
transferright.
So,
if
fans
are
there
that
is
much-much
betterthan
if
there
is
no
fan
right.
And
this
waythere
are
many
ways
by
whichit
can
beand
during
my
PhDprogram.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
30:05)
I
made
it
that
this
is
called
dump
chargingright
before
the
commencement
of
the
journey.
You
find
out
what
is
your
total,
heat
load
from
a
point
to
another
point
maybe
100
kilometre
or
200
kilometres;so,
whatever
that
this
load
needs
total
this
much
quantity
of
refrigeration.
So,
before
the
commencement
of
the
journeyif
this
is
kept
that
refrigeration
is
supplied
to
the
product.
So,
product
temperature
instead
of
-
20will
come
say
around
-
40or
-
50
or
-
30,
depending
onthat
load.
So,
you
have
supplied
it,
before
the
commencement
of
the
journeyand
this
during
journey
extra
load
which
you
have
given
will
take
care
of
the
heat
load
and
you
will
remain
at
-
20
or
look
below
this
is
calleddump
charging
liquid
nitrogendump
charging
systemright.
13
(Refer
Slide
Time:
31:25)
So,
this
wayyou
can
make
the
refrigeration
and
this
is
how
thetemperature
sorry,
howthe
temperatures
are
getting
affectedright
this
way;
obviously,
surface
will
beaffected
first
than
the
interiorright.
So,
this
wayyou
can
keep
yourmaterialtransported
from
one
place
to
other
place
and
whether
it
is
ice
cream
or
any
other
food
material
if
it
is
present
they
are
supposed
to
be
under
cold
chain
which
is
lacking
in
our
country
try
toput
it
when
you
are
gettingto
thereal
life.
So,
try
tomake
these
things
implemented
and
then;
obviously,
will
also
find
the
someday,
that
things
are
implemented
nicely.
Thank
you.
