Protein
(Contd.)
So,
we
are
discussing
about
the
basics
of
protein,
right.
So,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Products
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology
in
lecture
number
26;
we
still
say
about
the
basic
of
the
protein.
W e
you
if
you
recall
that
we
landed
up
to
some
terminologies
which
we
said
that
we
will
need
to
explain.
So,
let
us
look
into
that.
So,
we
said
that
folding
then
what
it
is?
Folding
is
protein
folding
is
the
physical
process
by
which
a
protein
chain
acquires
it’ s
native
3-dimensional
structure
a
confirmation
that
is
usually
biologically
functional,
in
an
expeditious
and
reproducible
manner .
This
we
have
said,
that
folding
is
what
explained
also.
Now ,
it
comes
that
what
is
that
physical
process.
The
physical
process
is
that
that
physical
changes
are
changes
af fecting
the
form
of
a
chemical
substance,
but
not
it’ s
chemical
composition,
right.
So,
it
is
af fecting
the
form
of
the
chemical
substance;
not
the
chemical
composition
like
we
know
simple
one
I
am
telling
that
fructose
or
glucose,
we
know
the
chemical
formula
is
C
6
H
12
O
6,
right.
Why
I
am
giving
is
that
because
this
is
simple,
but
when
we
are
going
to
any
complicated
things
like
a
protein
who
made
of
amino
acids
they
are
big
in
terms
of
structure,
in
terms
of
formulae
etcetera.
So,
to
understand
this
that
say
C
6
H
12
O
O
6,
right.
So,
this
combination
can
be
of
dif ferent
ok,
but
the
change
is
which
are
being
this
physical
process
where
it
is
being
happening
it
is
the
only
physical
system
change
it
is
happening,
right.
If
you
have
come
across
that
that
ok
I
give
another
that
C
dot
C
6
H
12
O
6
even
much
more
simpler
that
is
C
6
H
6
that
is
the
benzene,
right.
C
6
H
6
that
is
the
benzene
right,
benzene
can
be
the
straight
chain,
right
C
6
H
6
and
it
can
also
be
a
ring
chain,
right.
So,
and
also
it
can
like
the
one
which
we
have
just
said
about
that
glucose
C
6
H
12
O
6
it
also
can
have
a
straight
chain
it
can
also
have
a
ring
chain
structure
or
it
can
also
have
a
chair
form
structure,
right.
So,
but
all
of
them
are
the
physical
orientation
of
this
right.
So,
there
is
no
chemical
change
in
that
it
still
remain
C
6
H
12
O
6
or
C
6
H
6
and
there
their
chemical
properties
did
not
change.
So,
physical
process
means
where
the
physical
changes
are
being
brought
about
and
there
is
no
chemical
compositional
change
is
happening.
So,
physical
changes
are
used
to
separate
mixtures
into
their
component
compounds
like
physical
separation
in
our
school
age
we
you
have
done
that
you
were
given
a
mixture
of
sand
and
mix
and
may
be
some
iron
and
some
others
so,
how
can
you
separate?
So,
that
is
the
physical
separation
system.
So,
you
took
some
may
be
magnet
to
count
the
irons
and
then
you
separate
it
iron
and
this
thing
sand.
So,
that
is
a
physical
system
physical
change,
right.
No
chemical
it
neither
the
iron
was
chemically
changed
nor
the
sand
was
chemically
changed.
So,
this
is
what
is
the
physical
process
meaning
right,
but
cannot,
but
cannot
usually
be
used
to
separate
compounds
into
chemical
elements
or
simpler
compounds.
So,
we
have
not
brought
down
C
6
H
12
O
6
to
carbon
dioxide
and
ener gy
and
water
which
normally
we
do
in
our
respiration
our
respiration
the
basic
unit
is
that
C
6
H
12
O
6
that
is
the
glucose
from
where
we
are
getting
ener gy
and
this
is
getting
chemically
converted
into
carbon
dioxide
water
and
ener gy .
So,
that
is
the
chemical
change
no
longer
physical,
right.
So,
physical
changes
are
those
where
no
chemical
changes,
but
there
may
be
some
formation
or
separation
of
the
components
in
from
the
mixture.Then
we
said
native,
right.
So,
this
native
word
where
I
am
again
saying
it
is
rather ,
this
might
have
come
across
during
the
British
era
that
they
use
to
tell
the
Indians
to
be
native
know .
So,
that
native
of
course,
is
a
connotation
of
days,
but
the
meaning
of
the
our
native
protein
is
that
the
native
state
of
protein
or
nucleic
acid
is
it’ s
properly
folded
and
or
assembled
form
folded
both
folded
or
assembled
form
which
is
operative
and
functional.
The
native
state
of
a
bio
molecule
may
possess
all
four
levels
of
bio
molecular
structure
with
the
secondary
through
quaternary
structure
being
formed
from
weak
interactions
along
the
covalently
bonded
backbone
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
denatured
state.
Another
thing
which
you
might
have
come
across
that
is
called
denaturation
of
protein,
right.
So,
this
is
native
state
is
that
the
protein
on
nucleic
acid
in
it
is
properly
folded
or
assembled
form
which
is
operative
and
functional.
The
native
the
native
state
of
a
bio
molecule
may
possess
all
four
levels
of
bio
molecular
structure.
Four
molecules
means
four
structure
means
primarily
it
is
primary
structure,
secondary
structure,
tertiary
structure
and
quaternary
structure.
So,
all
this
four
could
be
there
that
is
what
it
is
called
the
native
state,
right
and
with
the
secondary
through
quaternary
structure
being
formed
from
weak
interactions
along
the
covalently
bonded
backbone.
So,
there
are
some
backbones
covalently
bonded
so,
that
can
be
interchanged.
So,
that
kind
of
that
is
possible
right
the
exists
called
the
native
protein
that
whatever
it
was.
So,
the
structure
in
terms
of
secondary ,
tertiary
or
quaternary
for
may
be
interchangeable
and
in
that
case
this
is
called
the
native
protein,
right.
But,
unlike
the
other
one
which
is
called
denatured
protein
denatures
protein
is
that
in
which
these
weak
interactions
amongst
the
secondary
to
tertiary
or
quaternary
state
or
quaternary
form
are
disrupted.
So,
they
are
no
longer
they
can
be
converted
or
they
can
be
interchangeable
to
secondary
to
quaternary
form,
right
that
is
called
denaturation
where
this
weak
linking
or
weak
interactions
between
the
bondings,
covalently
bondings
they
are
not
possible
leading
to
the
loss
of
these
forms
of
structure
and
retaining
only
the
bio
molecules
primary
structure,
right.
So,
if
they
are
leading
to
the
primary
structure
then
that
is
called
denaturation
or
denatured
protein,
right.
Then,
it
comes
that
nick
that
we
earlier
said
that
protein
or
nucleic
acid,
right.
So,
then
it
comes
to
nucleic
acid
what
is
that?
Nucleic
acids
are
biopolymers
of
small
bio
molecules
essential
to
all
known
forms
of
life.
Essential
to
all
known
forms
of
life
nucleic
acid
is
the
biopolymer
or
small
bio
molecules
which
are
essential
to
form
life.
They
are
composed
of
nucleotides.
Another
term
which
we
have
brought
in
nucleotides
nucleic
acid
from
there
nucleotide,
that
is
the
bio
nucleic
acid
is
the
biopolymer
or
small
bio
molecules.
They
are
essential
to
form
the
life
and
in
that
they
are
composed
of
the
nucleotides
which
are
monomers
made
of
three
components
like
a
5-carbon
sugar;
a
5-carbon
sugar
that
is
called
ribose,
a
5-carbon
sugar
a
phosphate
group
and
a
nitrogenous
base.
All
these
three
put
together
is
forming
the
nucleotide.
What
is
that?
5-carbon
ribose
a
phosphate
group
and
a
nitrogenous
base.
Now ,
if
the
sugar
is
a
compound
of
ribose
the
polymer
is
called
RNA
or
ribonucleic
acid,
right
and
the
if
the
sugar
is
a
derivative
or
derived
from
ribose
if
it
is
a
derivative
of
ribose
or
derived
from
ribose
then
it
is
called
deoxyribose
or
the
polymer
is
known
as
DNA
or
deoxyribonucleic
acid,
right
deoxyribonucleic
acid
or
DNA.
So,
that
means,
basically
both
are
it
is
having
a
sugar
unit
that
is
5
members
sugar
ribose
and
it
is
also
having
a
nitrogenous
component
as
well
as
it
is
having
a
phosphate
component.
All
these
three
put
together
is
forming
the
nucleotide
and
this
nucleotide
if
it
is
made
of
ribose
then
that
is
called
ribonucleic
acid
or
if
it
is
made
of
derivative
of
ribose
that
is
derived
from
ribose
that
is
called
deoxyribose
then
that
form
is
called
DNA
and
the
polymer
is
known
as
deoxyribonucleic
acid,
right.
Then
we
come
to
nucleotides
again
nucleotides
are
or ganic
molecules
that
are
that
serve
as
the
monomer .
So,
nucleotides
are
the
monomers
units
for
forming
the
nucleic
acid
polymers.
So,
nucleic
acid
is
the
polymer
whose
monomer
is
the
nucleotide
monomer
means
single
unit,
right.
Monomer
is
the
single
unit,
for
example,
though
it
is
not
a
part
of
it,
but
still
like
starch
is
the
polymer
of
the
monomer .
Which
one
is
the
monomer?
Monomer
is
the
glucose.
So,
starch
is
made
of
the
polymer
starch
is
the
polymer
made
of
the
monomer
that
is
the
glucose.
So
many
glucose
units
are
connected
and
that
is
how
it
becomes
a
polymer .
Like
I
gave
another
example
that
is
like
ethylene
CH
2
double
bond
CH
2,
right;
so,
ethylene
when
they
are
polymerised
means
n
number
of
ethylenes
are
being
added
then
it
becomes
polyethylene,
right.
So,
which
normally
we
know
as
polythene
every
now
and
then
we
come
across,
right.
So,
that
is
made
a
monomer
is
ethylene
and
the
polymer
is
polythene
or
polyethylene.
Similarly ,
here
the
monomer
is
nucleotide
and
that
the
nucleotide
is
what?
It
has
a
sugar
group
it
has
a
nitrogen
group
and
it
has
a
phosphate
group
all
three
put
together
is
forming
that
nucleotide
and
they
are
either
if
the
sugar
base
is
if
the
sugar
base
is
ribose
it
is
ribonucleic
acid
RNA
or
if
it
is
the
derivative
of
ribose
or
derived
from
ribose
that
is
calleddeoxyribose
that
is
called
DNA
or
deoxyribonucleic
acid
right
and
these
are
the
unit
block
for
the
life
called
nucleic
acid,
right.
So,
we
come
again
that
that
nucleotides
are
or ganic
molecules
that
serve
as
the
monomer
units
for
forming
the
nucleic
acid
polymers
as
deoxyribonucleic
acid
or
DNA
and
ribonucleic
acid
or
RNA,
both
of
which
are
essential
bio
molecules
in
all
forms
of
life
on
earth.
Nucleotides
are
the
building
blocks
of
nucleic
acids
they
are
composed
of
three
subunit
molecules
for
example,
as
we
said
nitrogenous
base
a
5-carbon
sugar
that
is
ribose
or
deoxyribose
and
at
least
one
phosphate
group
these
three
are
essential.
They
are
also
known
as
phosphate
nucleotide.
They
are
also
known
as
phosphate
nucleotide
like
this
one,
right.
They
are
also
known
as
phosphate
nucleotides.
So,
this
looks
like
this
ok.
This
looks
like
this
that
this
is
the
phosphate
unit,
this
is
the
nitrogenous
compound
and
this
is
the
sugar
base
compound
right.
So,
all
these
three
are
linked
connected
then
only
it
is
forming
that
building
block
are
called
nucleotide,
right.
Here
we
write
nucleotide
right.
So,
this
nucleotide
then
we
have
explained
here
that
is
the
nucleotide
contains
the
5-carbon
sugar
deoxyribose
at
the
centre
this
is
one
and
a
nitrogenous
base
called
adenine,
this
is
the
nitrogenous
base
this
is
called
adenine
and
one
phosphate
group,
this
is
the
phosphate
group
that
is
a
called
the
phosphate
group,
right.
The
deoxyribose
sugar
joined
only
to
the
nitrogenous
base
that
forms
a
deoxyribonucleic
acid
called
deoxyadenosin,
right
dehydro
deoxyribonucleic
acid
also
can
be
said
as
deoxyadenosine
whereas,
the
whole
structure
along
with
the
phosphate
group
is
a
nucleotide,
right.
So,
deoxyribonucleoside
and
this
is
also
deoxyadenosine
whereas,
the
entire
thing
is
known
as
the
nucleotide.
That
is
the
constituent
of
a
DNA
with
the
name
deoxyadenosine
monophosphate
that
is
the
entire
thing
deoxyadenosine
monophosphate,
right.
So,
this
is
how
the
nucleotide
comes
into
play
how
detail
we
have
said.
Now ,
from
this
nucleotide
let
us
go
to
the
protein
part.
That
is,
we
said
the
four
forms
that
is
the
primary ,
secondary ,
tertiary
and
quaternary ,
right.
So,
again
this
one
I
have
taken
from
the
source
I
have
given
that
this
is
the
source
from
W ikipedia,
we
have
taken
ok.
So,
here
we
see
an
anti
parallel,
but
an
anti
parallel
beta
pleated
sheet
displaying
hydrogen
bonding
within
the
backbone.
So,
hydrogen
bonding
is
happening
here,
hydrogen
bonding
is
happening
here,
hydrogen
bonding
is
happening
here
this
is
the
backbone,
right
the
hydrogen
bonding
is
happening
here.
So,
these
are
the
hydrogen
bonding
which
is
linking
this
part
and
this
part
through
this
hydrogen
bonding,
right.
So,
there
are
also
another
sulphidryl
or
sulphur
disulfide
bonding
that
also
we
will
come,
right
sub
subsequently
we
will
come
hopefully
this
thing
we
should
finish
today
otherwise
we
will
be
lacking.
So,
let
us
look
into
that
primary
structure
is
like
this
that
is
the
straight
forward
primary
structure
where
these
are
the
amino
acids
right
A1,
A2,
A3,
A4,
A5,
A6,
A7,
A8,
A9,
A1 1
just
given
a
primary
structure
that
is
straight
forward
amino
acids
are
linked,
right.
Then
it
is
the
secondary
or
pleated
sheet,
secondary
or
pleated
sheet
is
like
this
that
this
is
like
a
pleated
sheet,
right,
sheet
which
is
pleated
where
A1,
A2,
A3,
A4
and
they
are
all
connected.
So,
like
that
it
appears
to
be
a
pleated
sheet,
right
or
it
can
also
be
looked
into
like
this,
right
these
are
the
bondings
these
are
the
bondings
or
this
is
A1,
A2,
A3,
A4,
A5,
A6,
A7,
A8,
all
like
it
is
a
secondary
structure
or
pleated
sheet.
Then,
tertiary
structure
you
see
it
is
much
more
dif ficult,
right
like
a
coil
or
things
like
that
it
is
much
more
much
more
complicated,
right.
So,
here
there
is
a
heme
unit
or
here
there
is
a
heme
unit
here
there
is
a
heme
unit,
right.
So,
heme
unit
means
haemoglobin
or
globular
protein,
right
and
that
is
the
quaternary
even
much
more
complicated
than
this,
right
this
is
this
can
also
be
in
the
form
of
a
helix
which
called
helical
structure,
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
then
structure
that
is
the
primary
structure
we
should
finish
today
all
the
structures.
The
primary
structure
is
amino
acids
sequence
which
is
a
polyamide.
Primary
structure
is
a
amino
acid
sequence
which
is
a
polyamide
right
we
have
said
that
amino
acid
A
1,
A
2,
A
3,
A
4,
these
are
all
in
the
sequence
A
5,
like
that
as
many
you
can
think
of
as
many
you
can
as
many
you
can
put.
So,
the
accordingly
it
will
be
so
much,
right.
So,
this
is
the
amino
acid
structure
or
called
the
sequence
of
amino
acids
which
is
a
polyamide.
Secondary
structure
which
is
regular
which
is
regularly
repeating
local
structures
stabilized
by
the
hydrogen
bonds,
hydrogen
bonding
is
there
which
we
have
shown
there.
The
most
common
examples
are
the
alpha
helix
or
beta
sheet
which
is
also
known
as
beta
pleated
sheet,
beta
pleated
sheet
and
turns
because
secondary
structures
are
local
many
regions
of
dif ferent
secondary
structure
can
be
present
in
the
same
protein
molecule,
right
because
it
is
a
local.
So,
that
is
why
many
regions
of
dif ferent
secondary
structures
can
be
present
in
the
same
protein
molecule,
right.
Then
it
comes
to
tertiary
structure.
So,
tertiary
structures
are
those
where
the
overall
shape
of
the
overall
shape
of
the
of
a
single
protein
molecule.
This
is
the
overall
shape
of
a
single
protein
molecule
where
the
spatial
relationship
of
the
secondary
structure
to
one
another .
So,
overall
shape
of
a
single
protein
molecule
the
spatial
relationship
of
secondary
structures
to
one
another .
One
secondary
structure
to
another
secondary
structure
in
their
spatial,
that
is,
3-dimensional
arrangement.
T ertiary
structure
is
generally
stabilised
by
nonlocal
structures,
most
commonly
the
formation
of
a
hydrophobic
core,
but
also
through
salt
bridges,
hydrogen
bonding,
disulfide
bonding
and
even
post
translational
modifications.
The
term
tertiary
structure
is
often
used
as
synonymous
with
the
form
of
fold.
The
tertiary
structure
is
what
controls
the
basic
function.
Then,
it
comes
to
quaternary ,
right.
So,
of
course,
we
have
seen
that
this
is
the
disulfide
right,
this
is
the
disulfide.
So,
if
this
is
another
sulphide
with
chlorine.
So,
this
is
S
2
Cl
2,
right.
Similarly ,
this
is
another
sulphide
this
is
a
multi
block
of
may
be
multi
this
amino
acids,
right
and
in
there
we
have
said
another
term
called
post-transitional
post-translational
modification
or
PTM
this
refers
to
the
covalent
and
generally
enzymatic
modification
of
the
proteins
following
protein
synthesis,
right.
So,
the
last
one
which
we
have
is
the
or
this
is
another
example
of
salt
bridges
which
we
have
given,
right.
These
are
the
salt
bridges,
that
means,
both
you
have
here
hydrogen
bonding
as
well
as
ionic.
So,
that
is
covalent
and
hydrogen
bonding
and
ionic
bonding
together
that
is
called
the
you
your
this
salt
bridges,
right.
Then
we
come
to
quaternary
because
this
is
the
last
and
this
is
quaternary
structure
the
structure
formed
by
several
protein
molecule
that
is
polypeptide
chains
usually
called
protein
subunits
in
the
in
this
context
which
function
as
a
single
protein
complex.
So,
in
structural
biology
a
protein
subunit
right
subunit
here
we
said
the
structure
formed
by
several
protein
molecules
polypeptide
chains
usually
called
protein
subunits
and
this
subunit
is
a
single
protein
molecule
that
assembles
or
coassembles
with
other
protein
molecules
to
form
a
protein
complex,
right.
So,
I
think
we
are
running
really
out
of
time.
So,
let
us
call
it
a
day
and
again,
we
will
now
come
to
the
real
protein
in
the
milk
in
the
subsequent
class.
Thank
you.
