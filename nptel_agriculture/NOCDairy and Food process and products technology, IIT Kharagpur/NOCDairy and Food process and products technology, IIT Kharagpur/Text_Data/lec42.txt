Thermal
Death
Time
So,
now
we
come
to
the
42nd
class
that
is
in
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
lector
number
42.
So,
we
said
that
we
will
discuss
on
Thermal
Death
Time
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:37)
So,
if
we
want
to
look
at
the
thermal
death
and
curve
then
first
here
we
have
drawn
it
like
that
ok.
So,
the
thermal
death
time
of
microorganisms
in
food
processing
is
like
this
thermal
death
time
is
the
minimum
time
to
accomplish
a
total
destruction
like.
So,
if
that
be
then
we
are
plotting
x-y
plot
right
where
temperature
in
degree
centigrade
in
x
axis
and
TDT
that
is
thermal
death
time
in
minute
in
y
axis,
we
are
potting
right
and
this
is
the
plot
which
we
have
come
across
right.
So,
there
these
are
the
log
1,
log
2
log
like
that
similarly
in
the
this
is
in
the
log
paper
right.
So,
that
be
true
then
this
is
that
to
bring
down
1
1
log
cycle
this
is
the
temperature
which
we
are
this
is
that
and
this
and
this
temperature
1
log
cycle
is
being
reduced
and
this
is
the
slope
1
of
that
cure
right.
So,
we
come
to
that
slope
of
the
line
TDT
this
is
the
thermal
death
time
line
right.
So,
if
we
see
that
then
it
is
negative
slope
right.
So,
because
if
it
is
like
this
then
it
is
a
positive
slope
if
it
is
like
this
then
it
becomes
a
negative
slope,
I
hope
this
we
know
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
02:53)
So,
if
we
look
at
the
then
this
slope
for
TDT
line
is
.
From
figure,−𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑇𝐷𝑇)1−𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑇𝐷𝑇)2𝑇2−𝑇1
(
)
TDT
2
=1
and
TDT
1
=10
so,
corresponding
temperature
T
1
and
T
2
.
So,
by
using
so,
slope
using
z
value
which
we
have
said
1D
so;
that
means,
we
have
negative
of
that
we
are
taken
1D
that
is
1
log
cycle
that
is
−log𝑙𝑜𝑔 10() −log𝑙𝑜𝑔 1() 𝑧=−1𝑧
that
is
the
z
value
which
we
have
defined
right.
So,
this
is
nothing
but
is
equals
to
that
𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑇𝐷𝑇)1−𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑇𝐷𝑇)2(𝑇2−𝑇1)=1𝑧
because
here
we
have
one
negative,
here
we
have
had
a
negative
here
also
we
have
a
negative.
So,
that
is
canceling
out.
2
(Refer
Slide
Time:
04:18)
So,
.
This
can
be
may
be
in
the
next
slide
we
have
written.𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑇𝐷𝑇)1𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑇𝐷𝑇)2=(𝑇2−𝑇1𝑧
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:01)
So,
replacing
TDT
with
the
symbol
F
now,
if
we
replace
this
with
F
then
we
get
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐹1𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐹2=𝑇2−𝑇1𝑧
3
or𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐹1𝐹2=(𝑇2−𝑇1)
𝑧; 𝑜𝑟 𝐹1𝐹2=10𝑇2−𝑇1𝑧;𝑜𝑟 𝐹1=𝐹210𝑇2−𝑇1𝑧
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:39)
If
we
now
assume
that
F
2
to
be
reference
temperature
then
.𝐹1=𝐹210𝑇2−𝑇1𝑧
So,
.
So,
value
of
F
at
reference
with
the
reference
temperature
is
known
if
that
be𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒−𝑇1𝑧
known.
If
the
z
value
of
that
is
known
then
what
is
the
F
value
or
if
for
a
given
T
1
what
is
the
F
value
or
if
F
1
is
known
what
is
the
T
value
that
we
can
find
out
right.
4
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:09)
This
is
how
TDT
progresses
that
F
depends
on
this
says
that
F
depends
on
temperature
and
is
specific
for
microorganism.
So,
for
a
given
microorganism
that
F
is
a
function
of
temperature
right
that
is
what
we
have
seen
F
is
which
says
that
F
is
a
function
of𝐹1=𝐹210𝑇2−𝑇1𝑧
temperature
right.
(Refer

Time:

So,
if
that
be
true
then
broadly
we
can
say
that
pasteurization
can
be
categorized
as
either
low
or
high
temperature
pasteurization
methods.
Both
of
these
can
be
either
batch
or
continues
process
for
low
temperature
pasteurization
is
simply
is
majorly
concerned
with
food
safety
and
aims
at
killing
all
pathogenic
microorganisms
and
reducing
spoilage
types
in
a
food
sample.
Milk
that
has
undergone
low
temperature
pasteurization
is
suitable
for
making
cheese
because
it
encourages
syneresis
right.
Syneresis
that
day
that
time
I
have
I
hope
we
have
said
that
the
best
example
is
that
for
syneresis
to
understand
that
when
you
are
making
jam/jelly,
so,
that
time
if
there
is
an
jam/jelly
marmalade
they
are
physical.
They
are
there
is
a
physical
mixture
there
right,
there
is
no
chemical
bonding
in
that
it
is
a
physical
jell
and
in
that
jell
formation.
If
there
is
any
of
the
constituents
like
may
be
pectin,
may
be
acid
anything
if
they
are
not
in
the
right
promotion
then
the
jell
does
not
set
and
water
comes
out
from
the
jell
and
this
exudation
of
water
is
known
as
wiping
of
jelly
or
in
other
words
in
scientific
term
it
is
called
syneresis.
Here
also
that
exudation
right
in
cheese
exudation
is
required
so,
there
it
is
helpful
right.
So,
that
low
temperature
pasteurized
milk
is
helpful
for
making
cheese
product
widely
all
over
world
is
liked
by
people
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
10:25)
6
So,
if
that
be
true
then
let
us
look
into
that
low
temperature
pasteurization
can
assume,
low
temperature
pasteurization
can
assume
various
temperature
time
combinations
such
as
63
degree
centigrade
for
30
minutes
or
72°C
for
15
seconds.
Mild
heating
kills
all
pathogenic
bacteria
and
reduces
the
load
of
spoilage
bacteria
but
preserves
most
physico
chemical
properties
of
the
milk
that
is
an
advantage.
That
again
this
Q
10
is
coming
into
picture;
if
you
remember
Q
10
we
had
said
that
is
the
temperature
quotient
right,
you
remember
we
had
said
that
these
is
nothing
but
right𝐾𝑇+10𝐾𝑇
these
we
have
said
earlier.
So,
here
also
that
this
all
the
changes
which
are
occurring;
which
will
occur
they
are
function
of
the
temperature.
So,
if
the
temperature
is
high
then
the
reactions
whatever
it
be
good
or
bad
so,
they
are
also
increasing;
the
rest
of
the
reactions
are
also
increasing.
So,
the
lower
the
temperature
better
for
the
product
there
is
no
ambiguity
as
for
as
its
quality
is
concerned.
But
quality
that
is
big
term
which
we
had
defined
earlier
and
said
in
detail,
but
here
one
thing
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
our
target,
our
objective
is
to
kill
all
the
pathogenic
organisms
minimum
and
then
if
possible
many
spoiling
organisms
or
all
spoiling
organisms.
Generally,
these
spoiling
organisms
their
temperature
is
also
not
very
high
right
that
is
why
if
it
is
pasteurized
at
a
right
temperature
and
time
combination
then
not
only
the
pathogen,
but
also
many
spoiling
organisms
are
also
destroyed
right.
So,
this
is
for
low
temperature
low
time
that
is
what
we
call
63°C
for
30
minute
or
72°C
for
15
seconds.
On
the
other
hand,
high
temperature
pasteurization
aims
at
killing
the
vegetative
pathogenic
and
spoilage
bacteria
as
well
as
denaturing
as
much
serum
protein
as
possible
right.
High
temperature
pasteurized
milk
is
more
suitable
for
making
yogurt
because
syneresis
will
not
occur
there
or
not
repaired.
So,
high
temperature
pasteurization
is
they
are
required
because
yogurt
does
not
need
or
it
does
not
syneresis
does
not
happen
there.
So,
there
high
temperature
pasteurization
is
very
very
helpful.
The
serum
proteins
are
denatured
hence
they
will
not
separate
out
right
So,
it
is
denatured
so,
it
will
not
also
separate
out.
Otherwise
at
that
high
temperature
you
remember
we
said
that
when
you
are
making
that
protein
casein
separation
then
you
have
the
soluble
protein.7(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:11)
So,
those
soluble
proteins
if
they
are
heated
so,
they
become
insolvable.
But
when
you
are
making
denatured
then
the
properties
all
together
are
changed.
So,
that
is
that
is
what
is
happening
and
high
temperature
pasteurization
is
also
killing
the
spore
formers.
The
choice
of
pasteurization
whether
it
is
high
temperature
or
low
temperature.
So,
pasteurization
methods
depends
on
several
factors
which
may
not
be
limited
to
right
which
may
or
may
not
be
limited
to
intended
purpose
of
the
pasteurized
milk;
what
is
the
purpose
which
you
are
using.
Whether
you
are
making
cheese
from
the
pasteurized
milk,
whether
you
are
making
any
other
product
like
your
yogurt
or
you
are
making
the
whole
milk;
I
mean
liquid
milk
for
drinking
like
that.
So,
that
what
is
your
end
product
activity
what
you
will
do
with
that.
So,
that
we
will
dictate
that
will
tell
you
what
should
be
the
pasteurization
temperature
and
how
should
you
pasteurized
method.
Access
to
sophisticated
equipment
that
is
another
thing
you
may
need
to
do
pasteurization,
but
you
do
not
have
the
sophistication
or
the
instruments
which
are
sophisticated.
So,
your
access
if
it
is
not
there
in
spite
of
your
need
you
cannot
do
that
so,
that
is
another
aspect.
Volume
of
milk
to
be
pasteurized
that
is
another
aspect,
how
much
volume
you
have
to
pasteurized;
whether
it
is
100
litre
or
1
lakh
litres
or
10
lakh
litres
that
will
dictate
of
course,
the
availability
of
the
recent
or
improved
pasteurizers
or
methods
or
instruments.
8
Then
target
microorganism,
what
is
your
target
microorganism
because
from
the
target
microorganisms
from
its
TDT
curve,
you
can
know
what
is
the
time
and
what
is
the
temperature
required
to
inactivate
that
typical
target
organism
and
you
can
work
on
your
pasteurization
time
and
temperature
right.
So,
whenever
be
the
case
one
can
choose
to
carry
out
normal
pasteurization
or
ultra
pasteurization
right.
Now,
what
is
normal
pasteurization
will
preserve
milk
for
about
two
to
three
weeks
while
ultra
high
temperature
or
ultra
pasteurization
will
preserve
milk
for
even
up
to
one
year.
The
other
day
when
packaging
I
was
showing
I
hope
you
have
seen
that
there
are
some
packets
tetra
pack
things
were
like
that.
Now,
if
you
go
to
the
market
and
ask
that
I
want
sterilized
milk
they
will
give
you
similar
like
that;
that
depends
on
the
company
how
they
are
making
the
packet
whether
it
is
pyra
pyramidal
shape
or
whether
it
is
rectangular
shape
that
having
some
handling
facilities
or
things
like
that.
So,
that
will
depend
on
the
processer
how
they
will
make,
how
will
they
make
the
packaging.
But
definitely
that
the
high
temperature
were
ultra
high
temperature
pasteurized
that
milk
may
survive
or
may
sustain
even
up
to
one
year
or
more
whereas,
normal
pasteurization
the
milk
will
survive
no
around
one
to
two
weeks
not
more
than
that
right.
So,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
and
depending
on
that
you
have
to
select
the
method
pasteurization
right.
Then
different
types
of
thermal
processing
method.
9(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:04)
Different
types
of
thermal
processing
methods
are
that
thermi
that
this
is
thermization.
Thermization
is
a
process
or
it
process
where
the
milk
to
be
heated
between
57
to
68°C
and
holding
period
is
around
15
minutes.
So,
temperature
is
around
57
to
68°C
and
time
is
around
15
minutes.
So,
low
time
low
temperature
high
time
it
is
being
heated
for
pasteurization
right.
In
normally
we
had
given
that
earlier
time
temperature
combination
one
was
63°C
for
30
minutes
and
the
other
was
72°C
for
15
seconds.
But
in
this
the
thermization
we
are
calling
it
is
between
57
to
68°C
temperature
whereas
the
time
requirements
is
15
minutes
right.
So,
this
is
targeting
the
pathogenic
bacteria
while
leaving
the
good
bacteria
in
the
product.
So,
only
this
will
kill
the
pathogenic
microorganisms,
but
the
good
bacteria
which
because
you
are
heating
when
the
temperature
is
high.
So,
temperature
does
not
know
who
is
good
and
who
is
bad
right.
So,
depending
on
the
temperature
the
corresponding
organisms
also
will
get
killed;
so,
along
with
bad
organisms
if
you
are
also
killing
some
good
organisms
that
is
not
desirable
right;
because
nature
has
produced
in
such
a
way.
So,
if
you
are
killing
the
pathogenic
organisms,
but
restoring
that
good
organism/beneficial
organisms
then
the
that
process
where
the
temperature
zone
is
57
to
68°C
and
time
requirement
is
15
minutes
is
called
thermization
or
thermalization.
Then
there
the
low
temperatures
do
not
alter
the
structure
and
taste
of
milk
because
again
Q
10
so,
the
lower
the
temperature
better
of
it.10
So,
in
this
case
better
than
72°C,
72
is
much
higher
may
be
for
15
seconds,
but
much
higher
temperature
here
you
have
63°C
30
minutes.
So,
here
you
are
making
63,
57
to
68°C
within
this
zone,
but
it
is
15
minutes
that
is
what
you
are
heating
right.
So,
you
are
killing
all
pathogen,
but
not
the
desirable
or
favorable
or
helpful
bacteria
right.
Now,
batch
pasteurization
is
such
that
no
which
is
also
known
as
low
temperature
long
time
LTLT;
Low
temperature
long
time
pasteurization
where
milk
is
heated
to
63°C
for
30
minutes.
The
extended
holding
time
causes
alternation
in
the
milk
protein
structure
and
also
the
taste
because
at
63
though
the
temperature
is
low
but
time
is
more
right
though
the
temperature
is
low,
but
time
is
more.
So,
30
minutes
you
are
heating
at
63.
So,
lot
of
alterations
may
takes
place
in
the
milk
protein
and
its
structure
as
well
the
taste.
So,
that
you
have
to
keep
in
mind.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
23:25)
Then
flash
pasteurization,
that
is
another
pasteurization
process
were
you
are
doing
flash
pasteurization
also
known
as
high
temperature
short
time
HTST
pasteurization;
where
milk
is
heated
between
72
to
74°C
for
15
to
20
seconds.
And
the
targets
are
resistant
pathogenic
bacterial
spores
like
Clostridium
botulinum
spores.
So,
another
techniques
of
pasteurization
is
ultra
high
temperature
or
UHT
pasteurization.
There
you
are
heating
milk
between
135
to
140°C
for
2
to
4
seconds.
And
in
this
case
the
extreme
heat
targets
the
Couxiella
burnetii,
Coxiella
burnetii
which
causes
Q
fever.
11
So,
Q-fever
is
caused
by
Coxiella
burnetii
right
and
you
are
doing
ultra
high
temperature
pasteurization.
The
heat
kills
all
the
vegetative
forms
of
bacteria
and
the
milk
can
survive
for
9
months
around;
then
another
one
is
canned
sterilization.
This
is
a
wet
treatment
of
canned
milk
products
in
an
autoclave
or
specialized
treatment
chambers.
Autoclave
is
what,
autoclave
they
are
I
hope
you
have
seen
you
know
that
you
have
some
lid
and
you
have
some
water
some
heating
elements
there
so,
you
are
heating
and
locking
that
lid
tightening
it
so,
that
it
becomes
leakproof
and
then
heating
this
that
pressure
is
increasing.
So,
when
the
temperature
comes
to
121°C
you
are
keeping
for
15
minutes
and
that
is
called
high
temperature
sterilization
or
canned
sterilization.
So,
this
wet
treatment
of
canned
products
in
an
autoclave
specialized
treatment
chambers;
Heat
to
be
between
115
to
121°C
between
10
to
20
minutes
right.
So,
here
again
you
are
seen
that
range
right
115
to
120°C
and
time
is
10
to
20
minutes
right.
This
all
depend
of
course,
in
this
case
our
product
is
milk,
but
this
all
depends
on
the
many
factors
right.
What
is
the
pH?
What
are
the
types
of
food?
So,
depending
on
them
the
heat
treatment
may
vary
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:58)
So,
if
we
look
at
that
so,
the
next
our
today’s
time
is
almost
over
so,
we
will
come
to
this
next.
But
today
we
have
come
how
different
is
pasteurization
are
performed
right,
including
12
flash,
canned,
ultra
high
temperature
pasteurization
everything
we
have
come
across
and
this
we
should
keep
in
mind.
So,
that
subsequently
when
we
are
also
doing
not
only
pasteurization,
but
standardization
and
then
homogenization
all
this
process
will
be
covering
subsequently
ok.
Today
time
is
up.
So,
let
us
stop
it
today
now.
Thank
you.
