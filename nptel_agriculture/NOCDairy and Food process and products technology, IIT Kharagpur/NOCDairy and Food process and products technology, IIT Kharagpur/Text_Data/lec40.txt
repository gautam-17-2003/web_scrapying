Packaging
So,
after
processing
the
liquid
food
it
is
required
to
be
packaged.
There
we
have
seen
in
the
last
step
that
liquid
food
liquid
rather
liquid
milk
is
processed
and
then
it
is
packaged,
right.
So,
in
this
dairy
and
food
process
and
product
technology
in
our
fortieth
class
let
us
do
the
packaging
of
the
processed
milk,
right.
So,
if
we
do
that
packaging
of
the
processed
milk
let
us
look
into
first
that
packaging
system
now
depending
on
whether
you
are
packaging
system.
Obviously ,
can
be
of
many
types
depending
on
what
is
your
product
right
depending
on
what
is
your
product
that
will
dictate
what
type
of
packaging
will
be
suitable
for
you,
right.
So,
one
of
the
most
convenient
thing
was
in
earlier
days.
Nowadays,
it
is
again
it
again
not
so
much
in
the
market,
but
again
gradually
it
will
come
up
because
of
the
bad
use
or
misuse
of
the
plastic
materials
and
how
it
is
spoiling
the
other
art.
So
that
someday
it
will
become
mandatory
to
come
back
to
these
earlier
process
or
old
process,
right
where
the
packaging
units
were
with
the
help
of
returnable
packaging
material
right,
returnable
or
re-usable
packaging
material.
So,
this
re-usable
packaging
material
primarily
was
or
is
rather
is
the
glass
containers,
right.
So,
in
I
don’ t
know
how
many
of
you
at
your
age
how
many
of
you
have
seen
glass
containers
where
milk
is
being
supplied,
but
yes
in
our
early
days
when
we
were
at
your
age
we
have
seen
lot
of
such
milk
used
to
come.
And
it
was
mandatory
that
without
spoiling
the
glass
container
you
have
to
return
if
you
are
damaging
the
glass
container
then
you
are
supposed
to
pay
some
fine
or
the
price
of
the
bottle
or
things
like
that.
So,
that
there
is
a
mandatory
deposition
of
the
price
of
the
money
so
that
if
there
is
any
damage
that
can
be
taken
care
of,
right.
But,
nowadays
many
others
things
have
come
up
for
which
the
use
of
this
kind
of
glass
material
glass
material
yes
handing
is
very
dif ficult
because
all
the
time
you
have
to
take
care
whether
there
is
number
one
if
gets
broken
then
all
the
milk
is
coming
down
right
to
the
container
where
through
which
you
were
taking
or
the
place
where
you
were
the
thing
has
happen
or
the
glass
that
has
to
be
thrown
out.
So,
all
this
is
the
hassel,
this
is
hazard
definitely .
But,
this
hazard
was
counteracted
by
many
subsequent
development,
but
again
the
cycle
is
like
that
again
it
will
summed
or
the
date
will
comeback
because
of
the
use
of
the
plastics
in
many
ways
and
that
is
not
desirable,
right.
However ,
since
we
have
taken
it
to
be
the
packaging
right.
So,
let
us
take
it
to
the
way
that
first
returnable
containers
right
first
it
is
returnable
container ,
right
it
is
concerned
and
the
concerning
factor
is
using
returnable
containers
are
that
collection
of
the
empty
containers
washing
of
the
empty
containers
prior
to
filling
and
it
which
necessitates
the
intermediate
storage
facility
because
it
is
not
that
1
to
10
hundreds
number
of
bottles
you
are
handling,
it
is
several
thousands
to
lakhs
number
of
bottles
you
are
handling.
So,
before
it
is
being
filled
they
are
to
be
kept
somewhere.
So,
you
need
that
place
and
after
filling
you
need
somewhere
where
it
has
to
be
kept,
right
and
that
too
it
is
not
possible
that
you
fill
it
up
now
and
then
you
send
it
to
the
supplier
or
send
it
to
the
consumer
not
may
not
be
possible.
So,
some
intermediate
space
where
they
are
to
be
kept
the
field
one
on
field
one
and
also
and
then
they
this
require
lot
of
space
lot
of
lot
of
design
for
the
packaging
system,
right.
So,
one
such
let
us
handle
it
here
that
the
reception
of
the
empty
bottles
you
have
meant.
So,
after
that
it
goes
to
the
washing
and
maybe
directly
it
is
or
maybe
if
washing
is
already
filled
up
you
have
to
store
it
the
unwashed
empty
bottles,
right
and
these
unwashed
empty
bottles
itis
to
and
fro,
that
is,
if
it
is
not
going
directly
to
the
washing
it
may
go
to
the
this
storage
place
and
when
where
it
is
required
or
possible
it
will
comeback
for
washing.
So,
after
washing
again
it
may
directly
go
for
filling
if
it
is
possible
otherwise
it
will
go
to
the
again
some
storage
space
where
you
were
that
worst
cans
serve
worst
bottles
or
worst
container
is
being
stored.
Then
after
filling
it
may
go
to
the
storage
of
fluid
containers
the
storage
of
rather
fluid
containers
that
could
be
another
space
for
storage
or
it
can
go
to
the
distribution,
right.
So,
this
is
one
way
how
we
can
use
the
returnable
containers
now
it
will
look
into
the
design
of
this
how
the
containers
are
ok
before
that
some
more
items
we
let
us
discuss.
That
the
bottle
washing,
filling,
capping
machines
should
be
of
matching
capacity
because
all
of
them
your
bottle
washing
if
it
is
10000
liters
if
your
filling
is
20000
liters
and
if
your
capping
is
5000
liters
then
your
what
is
a
rate
determining’ s
number
5000
because
capping
maximum
you
can
do.
So,
that
is
not
desirable.
What
is
desirable?
That
all
these
processes
that
is
bottling
filling
or
washing
or
caping
all
of
them
are
having
the
same
rate,
right.
So,
capacity
is
same
that
you
have
to
first
ensure
otherwise
it
has
to
be
highly
labour -intensive
and
the
operation
will
require
decrating
or
crating
means
you
can
you
have
to
fill
it
in
crates
or
take
out
from
the
crates
that
is
also
highly
labour -intensive
and
it
may
take
unstacking
and
stacking
requirement
also
would
have
to
be
re
repeated
unnecessarily ,
right.
So,
these
are
to
be
avoided
if
the
capacities
are
not
matching
then
this
additional
hazard
additional
your
inputs
additional
expenses
may
be
required
for
handling
this
mismatch
by
the
by
the
laborer .
So,
that
is
not
desirable.
Now ,
pasteurized
milk
bottles
if
we
take
them
then
bottles
with
wide
necks;
so
first
reusable
one
or
returnable
one
is
pasteurized
milk
bottles
were
bottles
with
wide
neck
is
around
36
to
40
millimeter
in
diameter .
So,
that
is
used
suitable
for
ceiling
with
aluminum
foil
that
is
also
is
required
foil
caps
made
in-situ
this
caps
are
also
done
in-situ
from
reeled
to
strip
by
aluminium
foils
from
the
most
common
system
for
packaging
of
and
this
formed
a
most
common
system
for
packaging
of
pasteurized
milk,
right.
So,
bottles
with
wide
necks
of
36
to
40
millimeter
this
is
suitable
for
sealing
with
aluminium
caps
made
in-situ
and
the
this
is
formed
from
the
reeled
strip
that
is
continuous
strip
is
there
in
real
form
and
all
these
form
the
most
common
system
for
packaging
of
pasteurized
milk
and
in
this
is
called
returnable
containers,
right.
The
bottles
are
placed
into
crates
formally
made
of
galvanized
steel
wires
or
strips
and
nowadays
usually
of
plastic.
The
crates
have
internal
divisions.
So,
that
the
bottles
are
not
in
contact
with
one
another
to
minimize
risk
because
if
this
kind
of
crates
are
not
there
then
the
bottle
which
you
will
keep
if
they
are
side
by
side
without
any
dif ference
then
there
maybe
this
bottles
will
come
across
and
they
may
they
may
be
damaged
because
of
the
presence
of
the
proximity ,
right.
So,
they
are
designed
to
interlock
this
crates
are
made
in
such
a
way
that
minimum
risk
is
there
for
breakage
and
this
crates
are
design
in
such
a
way
that
interlocking
facility
interlocking
can
be
done,
so
that
a
stable
stack
can
be
built,
right.
If
it
is
one
crate
so,
next
crate
may
come
over
it
and
for
another
and
then
like
that
it
is
interlocking,
right.
So,
that
it
just
fix
on
the
one
over
the
other ,
right.Then
we
come
to
this
the
dimensions
of
dimensions
of
glass
bottle
crates
and
stacks
are
pasteurized
milk.
How?
See
this
is
the
bottle
which
is
having
this
is
one
A
is
this
height,
B
is
this
diameter
and
C
is
this
diameter ,
right.
So,
the
height
could
be
depending
on
half
liter
or
1
liter
capacity
200
to
67
or
this
neck
could
be
36
to
40
or
36
to
40
both
for
both
half
or
1
liter
and
C
that
is
this
is
for
half
liter
73
for
1
liter
89
in
diameter
in
milliliter
where
weight
in
gram
is
418
for
half
liter
and
610
for
1
liter ,
right
and
then
these
are
the
crates
right,
where
you
are
putting
your
bottles
in
like
this,
right.
And,
these
bottles
are
crates
are
here
A
that
is
the
height
and
C
is
this
and
B
is
this
dimension
so,
A
is
270
that
is
height
for
half
liter
or
330
for
1
liter ,
B
is
other
two
sides
is
430
and
350
or
505
and
320
and
you
can
accumulate
around
20
numbers
for
half
liter
or
15
numbers
in
1
liter .
Then,
you
get
the
stack
which
could
be
either
6
side
that
means,
you
can
put
6
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
6
such
crates
6
side
which
has
a
1545
millimeter
height
or
5-high
which
has
1590
millimeter
high
that
is
for
1
liter
and
this
is
for
half
liters,
right.
This
is
a
dimensional
distribution
for
bottles
crates
in
the
stacks
for
pasteurized
milk,
right.
So,
after
this
let
us
look
into
that
the
floor
area
which
is
required
that
we
have
seen
from
the
previous
one
the
floor
area
which
is
seen
is
that
here
right
floor
area
from
B
and
C
right
from
B
and
C
this
is
the
stack
floor
area,
right
from
B
and
C
we
sorry
we
see
that
that
you
if
you
multiply
this
with
this
it
will
come
somewhere
0.15
right
if
you
multiply
this
with
that
in
the
area
required
you
will
come
somewhere
that
0.15,
right.
So,
floor
area
occupied
floor
area
occupied
by
one
stack
of
crate
is
around
0.15
and
equivalent
to
a
milk
storage
capacity
of
around
400
to
470
liters
per
meter
square
depending
on
bottle
capacity
and
the
stack
height,
that
is,
whether
it
is
5
high
or
6
high
depending
on
that
also.
The
initial
cost
of
a
glass
bottle
prevents
single
service
use
for
pasteurized
milk
because
glass
bottle
containers
you
have
to
pay
for
the
glass
bottles,
right.
So,
lot
of
investment.
So,
if
you
have
hundred
thousand
liters
of
milk
to
be
supplied
so,
lot
of
bottles
you
have
to
initially
buy .
So,
that
is
highly
cost
requirement.
So,
that
is
a
bottle
neck
for
pasteurized
milk
to
serve.
The
ef fective
cost
dependent
on
the
number
of
times
the
bottle
can
be
re-used.
Obviously ,
if
you
buy
today
for
first
time
and
if
you
can
remove
it
for
20
times
or
10
times
how
many
times
you
can
re
use
some
may
get
broken
by
the
first
supply ,
some
may
get
broken.
So,
that
part
may
be
5-10
percent
is
there
to
be
replenished,
but
in
general
on
an
average
if
your
number
of
returnable
cycles
could
be
10,
20,
30,
50
depending
on
how
the
more
you
can
reuse
the
more
is
your
profit
or
less
is
your
chance
risk
factor ,
right.
So,
that
you
be
you
give
you
back
or
pay
you
back
that
investment
which
you
have
made
initially .
So,
initially
high
quantity
high
cost
is
required
for
buying
the
both
your
bottles
and
the
crates,
right.
So,
these
if
it
is
re-used
that
will
dictate
whether
it
will
be
primarily
by
the
ef fectiveness
of
the
bottle
recovery
system
and
ability
of
the
bottle
to
withstand
breakage.
So,
all
these
whether
it
is
re-usable,
returnable,
returned
or
reused
or
if
it
is
how
much
resistant
to
break
breakage
rather .
So,
depending
on
all
these
the
performance
will
also
depend
on
that,
right.
Then,
let
us
go
into
the
other
sterilized
milk
in
bottles,
right.
Sterilized
milk
in
bottles
so,
where
milk
is
in
bottles
and
it
is
sterilized,
right.
So,
bottles
used
in
use
for
in
bottle
milk
sterilization
have
narrow
necks
around
26
millimeter .
Earlier
it
was
a
bigger
neck,
right.
So,
now ,
it
will
be
much
narrow
sorry
much
narrow
such
that
you
were
this
coverage
can
be
easily
made.
So,
that
no
pilferage
if
there
is
there
that
is
not
desirable,
right.
So,
now ,
so,
that
a
more
ef fective
seal
can
be
made
and
prefabricated
crown
seals
are
used
to
seal
the
bottles
these
bottles
these
bottles
must
be
able
to
withstand
not
only
mechanical
shocks
during
handling,
but
also
thermal
shocks
during
sterilization,
right.
Y ou
have
taken
a
bottle.
So,
it
should
have
good
mechanical
strength
as
well
as
the
stability
towards
a
thermal
treatment
because
you
are
doing
in
bottle
sterilization
that
means,
in
the
bottle
you
are
putting
milk
first
and
then
you
are
sterilizing
and
you
know
for
sterilization
the
time
and
temperature
this
combination
is
very
high
and
for
that
if
the
bottles
are
not
either
mechanically
stable
or
heat
stable
then
you
are
loss
is
again
there
your
problem
again
started,
that’ s
why
it
is
required.
Even
more
during
cooling
also
that
after
heating
while
cooling
if
there
is
crack
you
are
done
for .
So,
during
cooling
both
heating
and
cooling
it
should
be
stable,
thermally
stable.
As
the
milk
in
the
bottle
is
heated
and
expands
during
heating
more
than
the
bottle
the
air
above
the
milk
becomes
compressed
and
the
pressure
inside
the
bottle
exceeds
the
external
pressure
the
contraction
of
the
milk
as
it
cools
below
the
filling
temperature
results
in
a
vacuum
in
the
space
above
the
milk.
This
vacuum
may
encourage
contamination
rather
may
encourage
contamination
through
the
seal
between
the
bottle
and
the
cap.
So,
that
is
the
danger ,
that
you
have
already
created
some
vacuum
inside
your
bottle.
So,
from
outside
it
is
always
there
is
a
possibility
that
there
will
be
some
invention
because
your
inside
pressure
is
low
outside
pressure
is
more.
So,
there
will
be
always
a
natural
tendency
from
outside
to
inside
invasion
and
the
moment
some
pressure
here
is
going
in
so
that
will
automatically
bring
some
or ganisms
to
the
bottle,
but
that
is
not
desirable,
right.
So,
it
is
always
there
for
important
that
the
seals
be
fully
airtight,
right.
So,
unless
your
seal
is
airtight
you
cannot
do
such
kind
of
things.
So,
this
is
a
bottle
like
that
dimensions
and
weight
of
the
glass
bottles
for
sterilized
milk
that
is
in
bottle
sterilization.
So,
for
half
and
1
liter
bottles
so,
we
have
this
cap
size
and
we
have
or
neck
size
this
is
the
height
this
is
the
diameter .
So,
75
diameter ,
26
your
cap
and
232
say
in
millimeter
your
height.
So,
this
is
for
1
liter
294
millimeter
whereas,
your
B
and
C
are
26,
75
and
26,
89
depending
on
whether
it
is
half
a
liter
and
1
liter
and
weight
is
around
460
to
735,
may
not
be
double,
but
somewhere
close
to
that
right.
So,
if
this
is
there
in
bottle
then
we
can
say
the
other
things
are
pasteurized
milk
where
the
aluminum
milk
can
and
aluminum
milk
can
has
proved
very
satisfactory
in
service
and
since
the
beginning
of
the
second
half
of
the
last
century
this
has
rapidly
replaced
the
previously
used
tinned
mild
steel
can
though
in
our
country
even
now
if
you
go
to
dairies
you
will
see
those
kind
of
mild
steel
and
tinned
containers
are
still
being
used,
right
though
it
is
not
advisable.
In
recent
years
high
density
polyethylene
cans
began
to
be
introduced
in
a
number
of
countries,
but
have
not
proved
popular
for
varies
reason
may
be
price
may
be
breakable
breakages
etcetera.
The
most
common
are
cans
with
lids
with
which
do
not
require
rubber
gaskets
and
adequate
seal
being
achieved
with
sunken
grip
or
mushroom
lids.
Because
of
mechanical
washing
problems
lids
attached
to
the
cans
by
chains
are
no
longer
used.
So,
lids
which
are
attached
to
the
cans
they
are
so
that
the
lost
is
minimized.
So,
that
is
also
not
desirable
because
during
washing
or
handling
it
is
very
dif ficult.
Through
simple
arrangement
at
the
lid
ring
lead
or
other
seals
can
be
applied
to.
So,
through
simple
arrangements
at
the
lead
ring
lead
or
other
seals
can
be
applied
to
make
the
contents
of
the
cap
or
can
pilfer
proof,
right.
Then,
we
come
to
last
that
is
ok,
this
is
let
us
make
it
very
quickly
the
cans
may
be
palletized,
but
more
often
floor
conveyors
are
used
full
cans
stored
in
one
layer
thus
allowing
about
320
to
360
litres
of
milk
to
be
stored
per
square
metre
ex
excluding
access
space.
Empty
cans
after
washing
are
stacked
in
layers
horizontally
up
to
the
height
of
1.5
meter
for
storing
and
moving
washing
and
washed
empty
cans
simple
trolleys
on
which
the
cans
can
be
stored
in
4
to
5
layers
are
very
useful
for
instance
about
20
cans
each
of
40
liters
capacity
can
be
stored
on
trolleys
about
1700
by
700
millimeter
inside
with
a
supporting
frame
made
of
a
half
inch
pipe,
right.
So,
now
this
is
how
it
looks
like
these
cans,
right.
Now ,
if
you
look
the
last
one
that
is
single
service
containers
and
these
single
service
containers
the
common
features
of
the
single
service
containers
is
that
after
emptying
they
are
discarded
this
fact
has
a
significant
impact
on
the
milk
plant
construction
or ganization
and
on
the
economics
of
the
whole
enterprise.
There
is
no
collection
and
washing
of
the
milk
package
only
crates
are
collected
and
washed,
but
even
they
may
be
replaced
by
single
service
delivery
wraps,
trays
or
boxes.
Palletization
may
be
applied
as
in
the
case
of
returnable
containers
intermediate
storage
of
packaging
material
and
filled
packages
is
required
and
this
must
be
provided
in
plant,
right.
So,
if
you
look
at
further
that
single
single-service
container
this
looks
like
that.
So,
they
may
have
one
where
gable
top
is
there
where
the
flat
top
and
another
tetrahedral
packs
right.
So,
there
are
the
two
basic
type
single
service
containers
are
there
one
is
cartons
and
other
is
plastic
sachets,
cartons
look
like
this.
And,
let
us
look
into
the
plastic
sachets
that
look
like
these
dimensions
of
the
cartons
crates
cartons
how
they
are
being
how
they
are
being
kept.
So,
this
is
like
that,
right;
how
the
dimensions
in
millimeter
of
cartons
crates
and
stacks
for
pasteurized
milk
like
that
it
is
being
kept.
And,
the
other
one
is
the
sachet
and
the
UHT
cartons,
ok,
it
could
be
like
this.
And,
and
pasteurized
milk
in
sachet.
That
is
a
pillow
shaped
that
is
a
pillow
shaped
one
which
is
a
like
this
pillow
shaped
one
and
like
this
they
are
put
in
the
crates.
So,
these
are
the
dimensions
right
and
they
look
like
this
and
they
are
kept
in
the
in
the
in
the
crates
like
this.
They
can
be
returnable
they
not
required
to
be
returned
so,
they
are
through
use
and
through
type
and
this
use
and
through
type
once
are
nowadays
very
popular
because
you
don’ t
have
to
consider
the
storage
and
other
things.
So,
this
is
what
out
time
is
up.
So,
up
to
packaging
we
have
finished
after
the
liquid
milk
processing
we
have
packaged
and
then
allowed
it
to
dispatch.
Thank
you.
