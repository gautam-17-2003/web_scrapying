Over
Run
and
Calculation
for
Preparing
Ice
Cream
Mix
So,
we
will
do
thatboth
we
have
prepared
ice
cream
cups
andof
course,
cones
are
also
like
that
from
the
curve
like
the
cups,
cones
are
also
being
built
like
thatphysically .Andin
thisDairy
and
Food
Process
and
ProductsTechnology,
today’s56lecture;
we
will
discussabout
Overrunand
ho
w
the
ice
cream
mix
arebeing
preparedright.
So,
there
is
a
proof
sheet
that
is
they
callit
to
beproof
sheetbecause
you
are
an
engineer
you
know,
but
the
workers
who
are
workingthey
do
not
have
that
much
of
thing.
What
they
need?They
want
a
proof
sheet
from
you,
youbeing
the
boss.
He
would
they
will
ask
from
you,
that
give
me
thatproof
sheetand
that
will
give
himthat
how
much
workhas
to
beadded
for
the
mixed
to
beprepared
right.
So,
this
is
what,
but
before
that
as
we
saidin
the
ice
cream
preparation,
thatincorporation
of
airright.
So,
if
incorporation
of
airand
I
gave
this
example
alsothatthat
drink
thatdrink
in
the
sense,
soft
drinks
which
are
being
sold
in
the
market;
that
is
basically
water
and
some
other
constituents.
Here,
it
is
basically
air
and
other
constituents.
So,
that
is
why
the
controls
bodythey
must
have
put
some
mechanism.
So,
that
the
minimum
things
arethere
such
that
the
consumer
is
not
gettingbe
fooled
right.
So,
here
alsoassumethat
if
you
have
out
of
50
ml
or
100
ml
say,
out
of100
ml
ice
cream,
if
you
haveonly
around
30
ml
of
materialand
rest
of
the
thing
is
only
air.
In
such
a
waythat
only
here
70%
air
is
there,30%
your
materialthen
of
course,
you
will
be
fooled
right?
Simultaneously ,
if
themanufacturer
has
to
putsay
70%your
materialand
30%
only
air,
then
that
will
not
be
ice
cream.
So,
and
unnecessarily
that
willshorten
the
profit
of
themanufacturer .
Nobody
will
come
forward
to
make
the
ice
cream
and
alsothe
quality
and
the
taste
will
be
different.So,
that
is
why
there
is
some
guideline
some
regulations
by
which,
how
much
material
and
how
much
air
you
can
put
in
one
ice
cream
that
1hasdefinition.And
this
is
doneby
the
term
called
Overrun
right.
This
overrun
is
associated
only
withthe
incorporation
of
air
right.
So,
overrun
means
you
are
runningone
thing,
and
how
much
extrayou
are
putting
in
itin
terms
of
air.
How
much
air
you
are
putting
into
itthatis
dictated
by
the
term
overrun
right.
Now
you;
obviously,
this
we
knowthat
air
density
is
very,
very
lowright.
So,density
is
very
low
means
air
volume
will
be
very
high,
but
the
mass
will
be
very,
very
low
right.
For
a
since
it
is
density
is
very
lowright
whereas,
ice
cream
mix
which
is
a
mix
offat,
protein,
carbohydrate,
vitamins,
minerals.
So,
whatever
thereall
put
together.So,
their
solid
content
is
very
high
right
and
the
density
isalso
very
high.
Since
the
density
is
very
high
there
for
given
mass
volumealso
will
be
very
low
right.
So,
to
balance
itthis
definition
of
overrun
is
made,
either
with
respect
to
volumeor
withrespect
to
mass
right.
So,
if
because
it
is
not
may
not
be
possible
all
the
timeyou
will
define
only
by
volume.
Sometimes
you
may
need
to
define
in
terms
of
masswhich
you
can
measure.
Volume
ofcourse
alsoyou
can
measure
right.
So,
both
the
possibilitiesare
keptso
overrun
is
defined
accordinglyright.
So,
let
us
look
intohow
overrun
is
defined.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:58)
2
Overrun
is
defined
like
this;
thatby
volumepercent
overrun,
this
is
calledpercent
overrun,
volume
of
ice
creamice
cream
means;
yourmixplus
air,
that
is
the
ice
creamright
so
ice
thisice
cream.
So,
mix
up
whatmix
of
ice
creamandplus
airthis
put
togethermakes
theice
cream
right.
So,your
volume
of
ice
creamwhere
airhas
been
incorporated
is
less.
Another
volume
is
moreright,
volume
is
more
and
volume
of
mix
whose
density
is
right
that
will
be
less.
So,
volume
of
ice
cream
minus
less
volume
of
mixovervolume
of
the
mix
times100
is
thepercent
overrunright
by
volume.
(Refer

So,
we
have
example
also
in
front
of
us.
Suppose
we
have
volume
of
ice
cream
mix9.5say
9.5mlright.
9.5ml
of
ice
cream
mixyouwhat
ice
cream
you
haveright,
or
herewe
have
given
that
isalready
there.
So,
we
take
50
ml
ofice
cream
we
have
taken
right
and
the
ice
cream
mixwe
havevolume
say
25
ml
right;ao,
50
minus
25by
25in
to
100.
So,
that
becomesthis
is
25by
25this
is
oneinto100.
So,
youare
overrunin
100%right.
3
Here
we
have
taken
9.5
minus
5
over
5
this
is
4
by
5
into
100,
that
is90
percent.
9.5minus
5that
is
4.5
over
5
is
0.9
into
100
is
90percent
right.
Here
we
have
shown
it
to
be
100
percent
by
volumeright,
because
ice
cream
has
more
volumethan
the
ice
cream
mix.
The
reason
being
ice
cream
contains
the
mix
that
is
the
solidand
liquid
and
air
so
volume
is
more.
Ice
cream
mix
does
not
have
any
airso
ice
creamminus
ice
cream
mix,
that
is
whose
volume
is
less
over
the
ice
cream
mix
volume
times
100gives
us
the
overrun
in
terms
of
volumeright.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:49)
So,
all
the
timethis
way
may
not
be
possible
another
example
if
we
takethat
if
we
have60
mlno
60
is
not
tocommonly ,
say100
ml.
We
have
100
ml
of
ice
creamand
out
of
whichwe
have
60ml
ofmix
right;
out
of
which
60
ml
of
mixover60
ml
of
mixtimes100
this
becomes40
by
60into100.
So
that
means,it
is
4
by6into100
that
is2
by
3into100.
So,
that
is
equals
to2
by
3
means0.66
or
66.66%
you
have
overrun
right.
So;
that
means,
youroverrun
is
much
lessright
you
can
have.
So,
100
ml
ice
creamin
which
with
60
ml
mix
you
have
givenand
you
have
an
overrun
ofpoint
66
66.66%.
You
will
think
that
I
am
getting
more
quantity
so,
butagain
the
ice
cream
itself
for
that,
4
thepalatability
they
testfor
that,
there
has
to
be
some
quantity
of
airminimum
otherwise
you
will
not
enjoy.
There
is
a
difference
between
ice
cream
and
kulfiright.
Kulfi
isalso
made
from
the
similar
ice
cream
mix,
but
kulfi
does
not
have
overrun
it
is
almost
negligible
around
4.10%
overrunright.
As
minimum
it
isgetting
incorporated4.10
percent.So,
there
it
is
majority
is
the
solid;
obviously,
the
taste
ofkulfi
and
the
taste
of
ice
cream
are
or
palatability
are
not
identical
or
sameright.
So,
it
is
not
that
if
I
want
if
I
want
to
give
my
customers
more
quantitythat
may
not
be
possible,
because
that
will
not
bethe
ice
cream
that
will
be
a
solid
masswhich
may
not
be.
So,palatable
so66.6
%which
we
have
come
for
this100ml
of
ice
creamwith
60
ml
of
mix,
ice
cream
mix
right.
Andthis
is
not
your
ice
cream
mix
means
this
is
not
only
solid,
but
also
the
liquid.
The
mix
is
the
entire
thingsolid
liquid
all
put
together
before
it
goes
to
the
freezer
that
is
called
the
ice
cream
mixright.
So,
this
ice
cream
mix
it
is
not
I
can
givemore
or
you
can
give
moreor
you
can
give
less.
This
is
one
example
ofgetting
the
overrun
very
low.
Anotherone
I
have
not
calculated
I
amdoing
iton
the
floor
itself.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

5
That
another
one
again
if
we
take100
ml
cup
andout
of
whichif
30ml
is
the
mix
and
if30
mlis
the
mix
volumethen
into
100that
becomes70
by
30into100.So,
that
is
equal
to2.33,right.
So
that
means,
it
is
into100
it
is
almost233%your
overrun
right.
So,
in
100
mlice
creamyou
have
given
only30ml
mix.
And
rest
of
the
thing
is
your
right
so;
that
means,
the
consumer
is
getting
only
airor
majority
is
air
so
he
will
bedeprived.
So,
you
will
buy
for
10
rupees,
20
rupees
whatever
be
the
value
50
rupeesI
do
not
know;
that
depends
onthe
variety
etcetera.
Whatever
be
the
price
out
of
which
he
is
getting
a
very
small
quantity
of
the
material
as
a
mix.
And
large
quantity
of
air
so
that
is
he
is
getting
deprived.
So,
you
cannot
and
here
of
course,
by
that
your
profit
is
very
high,
because
you
are
given
herewhich
hasno
valuevirtually ,
no
value
right.
Only
the
air
which
goes
into
the
ice
cream
preserveit
is
supposed
to
be
clean.Andaesthetically
not
only
aestheticallymicrobiologicallyit
should
be
should
be
cleaned.
So,
thathe
does
not
incorporate
any
infection
to
the
system.
Because
after
when
you
were
mixingit
is
all
getting
cold
you
are
not
getting
any
chance
of
heating
or
cooling.
So,
air
has
to
be
under
very,
very
cleancondition
without
any
having
anysource
of
infection
or
any
contamination
with
themicrobial
load
that
must
be
there
right.
So,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
andnot
only
this
we
have
tokeep
in
mind
that;
the
air
which
you
are
giving
the
airthis
air
will
go
and
mixwith
theice
cream
mixand
then
make
the
ice
cream.
And
when
you
are
consumingthat
time
if
that
air
is
already
contaminated.So,
that
will
be
already
insideso
you
have
consumedand
there
is
a
chance
of
you
getting
infected
if,
the
air
is
containingsome
airborne
organisms
right.
So,
that
is
whyair
it
has
though
it
iswe
are
saying
that
air
isfree,
but
yourcost
involvement
is
only
there;
that
when
you
are
passing
thisairyou
must
disinfect
this
airbefore
it
isgoing
into
your
system
right.
This
is
a
must
this
is
a
compulsory
otherwise
it
will
be
infected.
However,it
is
making233%
in
under
this
situation.
So,
that
is
not
desirableyou
are
fooling
your
customerconsumer
is
getting
deprived
not
possibleright.
So,there
must
be
6some
process,
there
must
be
some
mechanism
by
which
neither
consumer
will
be
deprived
nor
the
manufacturer
also
will
run
with
the
loss,
because
he
is
manufacturing
for
profit
to
gain
hisbread
and
butter.So,
that
will
come
from
the
profit
and
that
will
we
given
to
the
also
thepeople
who
are
working
the
workersetcetera.
So,
a
minimum
profit
has
to
be
there
because
ice
cream
mixthat
will
also
cost
it
is
not
that
entirely
are
like
air
everything
is
free.
So,
air
is
also
become
costly
because
you
have
to
disinfected.
This
in
disinfection
will
also
cost
you
a
little;
may
not
be
very
high,
but
a
little
disinfectioncost
has
to
be
involved.So,theremust
be
some
provision,
there
must
be
someguidelineby
whichneither
you
make
it
to
233%noryou
make
it
66%right.
So,
if
it
is233%then
you
are
gaining
a
lot
that
is
the
manufactureris
getting
a
lot,
but
if
it
is
66%then
manufacturing
is
manufacturer
isgivingmuch
more.
And
you
as
a
consumer
is
gainingvery
much.So,
that
is
also
a
lostto
themanufacturer .
(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:54)
So
neither
he
should
be
a
lost
to
the
manufacturernor
it
should
be
depriving
the
consumer,
such
thinghas
to
be
given.And
the
controlling
authority
as
kept
this
thing
in
mind
and
that
is
whymade
that
any
ice
cream
cannot
have
less
than90
percentoverrun
ormore
than105percent
overrun.
So,
overrun
should
varybetween
90
to
105if
it
is
less
7
than
90then
that
will
be
a
loss
to
the
to
the
manufacturer .
If
it
is
more
than
105
that
will
be
again
depriving
the
consumer.
So,
neither
the
consumer
is
deprived
nor
thenor
the
manufacturer
isgettinga
getting
a
loss,
for
thatthere
is
this
bindingthatthe
105to
90within
thisthe
overrunhas

90

therehas
to

thereso
like
that
here
we
gotit
90.So,
this
is
the
typical
examplethatit
is
((9.5-5.0)/5.0)X
100=
90%
So,
it
is
likewise
it
can
beup
to
105
percentright
so
this
is
by
volume.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
21:33)
Similarly,
if
we
look
into
by
weightthen
we
get
by
weight
it
is
like
this,percent
overrun
isweight
of
the
mix
inearlier
we
have
said
mix
as
high
density.So,
less
low
volumemore
weight
so
weight
of
the
mixof
1
gallon
minus
weight
of
theice
creamof
1
gallon.
This
is
gallon
is
agallon
is
a
volume.
So,
you
can
make
it
that
weight
of
ice
creammix
of
say100
mlright,minus
weight
of100
mlice
creamright
ordivided
byweight
of100ml
ice
creambecause
ice
cream
will
have
less
weight
than
ice
cream
mix
right.
So,
1gallon
or
100
ml
that
is
a
definitevolumefor
a
definite
volume
of
the
both
mix
and
the
ice
cream.
If
your
weight
difference
is
known
divided
by
the
smallest
way,
that
is
the
8
ice
creamweightingthis
case
times
100
that
will
give
usthe
percent
overrun
in
terms
of
weight.
Generally,
commercially
this
percent
overrun
in
terms
ofvolume
isvery
much
popular
because
thatyou
are
makingthat
ice
cream
not
by
weight.
You
are
selling
ice
cream
not
byweight,
you
are
going
to
the
parlor
or
any
ice
creamshopwhere
your
ice
cream
is
available
your
going
and
asking.
That
give
me
a
50
ml
cupor
100
ml
cup
or
maybe
1
literor
maybe
4
liters
gallonthat
you
were
telling
all
in
terms
of
volumeright.
All
you
are
telling
in
terms
of
volume,
but
not
in
terms
of
the
weight.
That
is
why
the
percentoverrun
by
weight
is
less
popular
than
not
only
less
normally,
commerciallyin
the
in
the
in
thesoft
floor;
it
is
not
there
it
is
all
by
the
percent
overrun
by
the
volume.
However,
to
have
the
ideawe
have
given
thisthat
percent
overrun
bybreath
you
say
8.85
is
the
weight
of
the1
gallon
of
mix
right,
or
one
known
volume
of
mix.
Minus
weight
of
the
same
volume
of
ice
creamthat
is
say
5.06over
the
weight
ofthe
same
value
of
ice
creamthat
despite
0.06
times
100,
this
gives24.9%overrun
right.
And
generally
1
gallonis
3.7854liter ,
but
in
our
country
in
all
ice
cream
industry
they
make1
gallon.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:50)

It
is
stillit
is
said
galloncontainer
gallonice
cream,
that
is
still
being
said,
but
the
quantityput
is
4liter
not3.784this
is
the
4
liter.
Accordingly ,
price
is
also
or
whatever
would
have
been
a
with3.784that
is
convertedinto4
liter
correspondingly .And
the
price
isheld
forthat
4
literright.
So,
when
you
call
it
to
be
gallon
packthen
it
isa
4-liter
pack.
If
it
is
a
partypackthen
it
is
aone-liter
pack.
So,
generallythey
have
these
volumesyour
lollies,
your
lollies
that
isdifferent
than
50
ml,
then
100
ml,
then
1000
ml,
then4000
ml.
These
are
thegenerally4
types
ofvolumes
they
are
used
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:02)
I
repeat
50
ml,
then100
mlthen
and,then
1000
ml,
1000
mlor
4000
ml.
These
4
volumes
arenormally
with
the
ice
cream
industry
right.
So,
you
will
not
get
in
between
2
litersyou
will
not
get
5
liters
like
that.
So,
these
4
are
the
volume
quantitiesyou
will
get
in
the
market50
ml,100
ml.
50
ml
was
not
theremaybecouple
of
decades
back
it
was
introduced
in
the
ice
cream
industrybecause
when
the
pricewas
going
up,
then
this
thoughtthat
100
ml
may
betoo
costly
tobuy.
So,let
us
make
ithalf
of
that.So,
50
mlcame
in
right
and
in
theprice
became
almost
close
to
up
and
that
is
right,
people
could
buythose
who
are
not
so
rich
they
can
buy.
10
So,
that
is
why
to
make
it
more
popular
to
distribute
it
amongst
many
peopleso
50
mlwas
alsointroduced
right.
And
the
ice
cream
lollies
if
they
are
having
the
fixed
more
or
less
volume
more
or
lessyes,if
there
is
will
bethis
sidethat
sidesome
moresome
less,depending
on
thehow
many
numbers
of
years
are
there
right.
So,
you
will
see
that
there
are
on
Choco
bars
and
many
others.
They
are
one
type
multi
layers
another
type
that
is
againthere
are
depending
on
themanufacturer
whether
it
is
made
from
Amul
made
fromVadilal
made
fromkwalityor
made
from
any
other.So,
they
will
have
a
slightvariation,
but
not
much,
but
these
cups
andparty
packs
are
gallon
volumes
they
arefixed
or
everywhere
rightand
accordingly
this
is
met
ok.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:34)
Thenwe
have
we
have
spent
a
lot
in
it,
let
us
go
intoa
quicklyan
example
right.
Say
if
20
liter
of
fruit
weighing
5
kg
per
literisadded
to
100
liter
of
mix
weighing
4.5
kg
per
liter,
and
200
liter
of
ice
cream
is
producedwhat
is
the
overrun
in
the
mix?So,we
get
sorry,
we
getthe
overrun
to
bearoundhere
we
have
seen
that
from
this
calculation66.6%
right.
Then
actual
overrun
is
(200-120)X
100/100
=
80
%
Now,
as
I
said
earlier
that
when
Iit
wasI
was
saying
about
the
vertical
and
both
horizontal,
when
it
is
going
another
from
4degree
to
minus5
degree.So,
you
see
I
have
given
it
inFahrenheit
because
these
are
the
whole
numbers.

I
hope
you
knowthat
there
is
one
temperature
where
bothFahrenheit
any
centigrade
are
same.And
I
hope
you
know
thatthat
is
-40.So,
-40°F
and
40°C
are
same;
however,
we
are
not
going
tothat.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
30:33)
So,
it
shows
that
if
you
havea
plot
of
saytemperatureversus
percent
to
water
frozen.
Percent
to
water
frozen
is
dependent
on
temperature
right,
so
this
is
percentwater
frozen.
So,
if
we
plot
that
so
as
if
thisis
25
24so
minus
15.
So,if
this
is
0
and
minus
15is
here
right.
So,
if
our
plot
is
minus
20todown
below
there
then;
obviously,
you
will
haveoneasymptotic
thing
like
this
right.
12
So,
one
asymptotic
canthis
sorry;
so
this
is
0
or
something
and
minusis
this
way
right.
No
then
that
will
bethe
so
we
haveFahrenheit
hereand
we
have
percent
hereand
we
have
minus20
here,
and
we
have
plus
say
0or
20
you
have
30Fahrenheit
hereright
if
that
be.
So,
30Fahrenheit
is
33
percent,
30Fahrenheit
is
33
percentand
95
minus
15.So,
here
is
90
percent
so;
that
means,your
thing
is
going
like
this
asymptotic
right.
So,
percent

frozen
becomeand
this
is
tellingabout
thebound

this
is
telling
about
the

ok.I
hope
we
have
cross
the
timetoday,
so
let
us
stop
today
here.
Thank
you.
