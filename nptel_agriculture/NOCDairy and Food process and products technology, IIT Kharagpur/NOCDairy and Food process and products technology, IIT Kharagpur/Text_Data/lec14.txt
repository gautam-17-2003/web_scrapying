Standards
in
India
So,
we
were
discussing
about
the
food
safety
security
agency
in
India
or
authority
in
India
FSSAI.
This
is
the
implementing
organization
or
framing
organization
in
our
country
to
implement
the
Food
Safety
and
Security
Act,
2006
which
was
passed
by
the
parliament
right.
So,
we
came
to
up
to
that
now
we
also
said
we
will
look
into
the
different
orders
which
are
different
controlling
bodies,
who
are
also
associated
with
them
or
with
the
food
and
that
comes
under
this
Standards
in
India.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:15)
So,
if
you
look
into
this
that
there
is
one
organization
called
Bureau
of
Indian
Standard
or
BIS
if
you
go
and
look
into
any
food
laws
in
libraries.
You
will
see
that
different
BIS
numbers
are
there
for
different
things
or
different
numbers
are
there
for
different
things
right.
It
is
not
necessarily
that
BIS
will
only
look
into
the
food
part;
they
also
look
in
many
others
right.
1
So,
that
BIS
is
one
such
body
one
such
organizing
or
controlling
authority
who
does
on
the
national
level
or
that
is
a
national
body
of
India
for
all
standards
that
that
reserves
to
be
the
leader
in
all
matters
concerning
standards,
certification
and
quality .
You
remember
in
the
class
we
were
saying
that
this
FSSAI
or
our
apex
body
is
like
that;
like
BIS,
they
do
they
do
give
accreditation
to
certain
labs,
certain
people,
certain
organizations
that
the
power .
Power
is
given
that
they
are
empowered
to
go
through
the
quality ,
safety
all
these
aspects
they
are
entitled
they
can
do,
they
can
perform
the
test.
And
they
have
the
authority
to
either
certify
or
cancel
the
typical
particular
product
right.
So,
those
standards
are
also
being
framed
by
this
or
body
are
called
BIS
or
Bureau
of
Indian
Standard
right.
What
it
does?
It
harmoniously
develop
standards
marking
quality
certification
right?
So,
it
develops
the
standards
or
the
process
of
standardizations
that
marking
and
quality
control
or
certification;
this
is
done
by
this
body
BIS.
It
provides
new
thrust
to
standardization
and
quality
control.
It
evolves
a
national
strategy
for
according
recognition
to
the
standards
and
integrating
them
with
growth
and
development
of
production
and
exports
right.
In
this
regard,
let
me
also
tell
certain
things
which
are
also
relevant
that
though
as
food
from
India
the
quantity
of
export
is
not
that
big
as
the
country
is
right.
It
is
very
bigger
in
number ,
bigger
in
amount
as
for
as
the
country
volume
and
the
population
is
concerned;
it
is
really
a
bigger
number .
But
in
spite
of
all
these
controlling
agencies
and
bodies;
all
these
standards
there
are
many
cases
since
the
word
export
has
come
up.
And
I
am
also
saying,
I
am
also
sharing;
You
might
also
have
come
across
a
through
media
that
in
many
cases,
the
consignments
which
we
are
exported
were
returned
100
%.
Now ,
this
is
a
great
loss
to
the
company
who
is
doing
it
and
to
the
nation
because
this
not
only
we
will
also
develop
the
company
to
grow
up,
but
also
will
have
the
capability
of
bringing
foreign
currencies
to
the
country
right.
We
are
not
going
into
those;
what
is
the
requirement
of
foreign
currency
etcetera
into
those
economics
because
that
is
not
absolutely
part
of
this,
but
it
is
obvious
that
foreign
currencies
are
also
required
for
who
does
not
have
unique
currency
or
international
currency
as
a
common
currency
in
that
country
like
hours
right.
2Rupee
is
not
saleable
everywhere
all
over
the
world
it
is
true,
but
either
or
dollar
or
euro
things
like
that
which
I
have
more
impact
in
the
market.
So,
they
are
more
accessible
more
not
only
accessible
more
saleable
more
acceptable
by
different
countries
right.
So,
in
that
respect
consignment
getting
rejected
is
definitely
huge
setback
for
the
company ,
as
well
for
the
nation.
I
heard
in
one
case
that
in
a
one
whole
consignment;
there
are
some
flies
or
things
like
that
or
some
vertical
small
insects
who
are
there
for
that
the
entire
consignment
was
rejected.
It
is
the
privative
of
the
importing
authority ,
importing
country
who
will
decide
because
you
like
you
when
you
go
and
ask
for
a
new
product,
you
are
giving
money;
so
you
have
the
say
that
I
will
accept
this
product
or
I
will
reject
that
product
because
you
are
buying.
So,
it
is
buyers
market
right
had
it
been
like
that
the
buyer
has
no
other
option,
other
than
accepting
that
that
would
have
been
all
to
be
the
different.
But
it
is
not
so,
it
is
absolutely
not
so;
because
there
are
many
exporters,
many
such
similar
products
may
be
available
from
all
over
the
world.
So,
the
importer
has
the
choice
to
accept
it
or
not,
but
this
is
a
small
example,
but
in
reality
there
are
many
cases
where
either
due
to
the
poor
quality ,
maintenance
or
poor
microbial
quality
or
its
maintenance
things
are
getting
rejected
or
they
are
the
whole
consignment
is
discarded.
So,
this
is
not
definitely
a
good
thing.
So,
if
controlling
agents
like
this
FSSAI
or
say
BIS;
if
the
loss
or
the
standards
or
the
framework
which
they
are
developing,
which
they
are
asking
the
people
to
avoid
by;
if
they
are
in
to
or
word
to
word
or
in
real
sense
if
they
are
implemented,
then
definitely
the
rejection
can
be
as
minimum
as
possible
right.
So,
looking
back
into
that
what
the
purpose
of
these
BIS;
it
provides
new
thrust
to
standardization
and
quality
control.
It
evolves
the
national
strategy
for
according
recognition
to
standards
and
integrating
them
with
growth
and
development
of
production
and
exports.

Then
main
activities
of
BIS
are
what?
For
certification
to
products,
products
are
certified
by
BIS,
hallmarking
of
gold
jewellery ,
which
is
not
our
that
is
why
I
said
this
is
not
only
the
food
which
is
done
by
the
BIS,
but
many
others;
so,
this
is
one
such.
Quality
Management
System
or
QMS;
Environmental
Management
System
or
EMS,
Occupational
Health
and
Safety
Management
System
or
OHSMS,
Food
Safety
Management
System
or
FMS,
Hazard
Analysis
and
Quality
Control
Points
or
HACCP;
in
short
it
may
be
said
HACCP ,
in
many
cases
people
do
pronounce
it
as
HACCP ,
but
it
is
a
HACCP
that
is
Hazard
Analysis
and
Quality
Control
Points;
H;
hazard
Analysis
A
and
CC
that
is
Critical
Control;
Point;
CC,
Critical
Control
and
P
for
Point.
So,
HACCP
which
is
it
is
a
very
big
word
which
is
associated
with
food;
so
keep
in
mind.
Imported
products,
laboratory
management
then
international
activities
training
services
all
these
activities
are
being
done
by
the
BIS.

(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:37)
Another
implementing
authority
or
agency
is
called
AGMARK;
A
G
M
A
R
K
right.
In
many
cases,
you
will
see
this
AGMARK
is
symbol;
AGMARK
is
the
brand
or
I;
I
do
not
say
brand,
AGMARK
is
the
controlling
agent
whose
certification
is
approved
or
is
accepted
by
the
law.
So,
that
AGMARK
is
a
quality
certification
mark.
So,
any
product
they
will
see
when
it
is
coming
in
advertisement,
they
do
say
that
this
is
under
AGMARK
right;
A
G
M
A
R
K.
So,
it
is
under
AGMARK,
AGMARK
say
symbol
is
there.
So,
it
is
I
mean
what
we
called
that
blindedly;
we
can
accept
right.
Here
as
a
scientist,
you
should
also
keep
in
mind
that
science
does
not
believe
blindly
right?
Science
does
not
believe
blindly;
what
is
supposed
to
be
true
may
or
may
not
be
true
at
the
end.
So,
science
is
always
curious
and
that
curiosity
is
served,
curiosity
is
supported
by
the
facts
and
figures
of
the
analysis.
So,
what
is
supposed
to
be
true;
again
may
or
may
not
be
that
is
why
that
though
it
may
be
have
hallmark,
but
still
people
do
have
in
their
mind;
this
kind
of
some
kind
I
should
say
some
kind
of
a
negative
attitude
in
the
mind
that
may
or
may
not
be
correct
or
true
right?
Whether
it
is
under
AGMARK
or
not;
that
means,
in
other
word
that
that
both
the
controlling
agent,
as
well
as
the
control
mechanisms
are
to
be
such
that
they
are
good
enough
to
gain
the
popularity ,
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
consumer;
to.
It
is
again
ultimately
the
consumer
everywhere
this
is
the
ultimate
who
is
the
deciding
factor
that
consumer .
5
If
consumer
is
satisfied
this
consumer
is
happy ,
this
consumer
is
having
no
grudge,
this
consumer
is
not
complaining;
then
things
are
all
right.
But
if
and
the;
I
said
in
some
earlier
class
that
the
level
of
consumer
is
varied
right
from;
we
can
save
from
plus
infinity
to
minus
infinity
that
kind
of
wide
variation.
Some
are
very
knowledgeable,
some
are
absolutely
not
why?
When?
How?
All
these
are
not
are
not
bothered
by
them.
So,
that
is
why
that
this
word
consumer
is
a
really;
it
is
a
really
huge,
I
should
say
huge
term
huge
word
encompassing
huge
sum
1
crore
or
130
crore
number
of
people
right?
I
am
not
saying
that
all
the
time
all
the
people
these
so,
130,
140
crore
people
are
going
and
buying;
may
be
part
of
that.
And,
but
consumption
is
being
done
by
everybody
right.
So,
if
somebody
may
be
X
has
procured,
but
Y
has
consumed
and
Y
has
all
the
right
to
either
protest
or
complain
or
praise;
I
am
not
saying
that
complaining
is
all
the
time.
It
is
also
praising
yes;
this
is
very
good
that
also
is
the
certification
and
satisfaction
of
the
consumer
right.
So,
AGMARK
is
a
quality
certification
mark;
the
directorate
of
marketing
and
inspection
enforces
the
agricultural
produce
that
is
Grading
and
Marketing
Act,
1937;
under
this
act
great
standards
are
prescribed
for
agricultural
and
allied
substances.
What
it
does?
Again
like
earlier
FSSAI;
we
have
given
to
vital
notes,
here
also
we
can
say
that
it
ensures
quality
and
purity
of
a
product,
it
acts
as
a
third
party
guarantee
to
quality
certified
right?
So,
company
X
is
making
out
product
A;
selling
it
to
man
M
right?
And
this
man
M;
may
or
may
not
believe
the
company
X
that
whatever
he
is
claiming
is
may
or
may
not
be
true
or
correct.
So,
who
will
certify?
So,
this
AGMARK
is
saying
that,
no
whatever
he
is
saying,
whatever
he
is
claiming.
He
is
correct
because
it
has
under gone
this
standards,
it
has
under gone
this
tests
such
and
such
organizations
have
under
taken
these
tests
and
their
reports
are
also
examined
by
the
scientific
panel
of
the
of
the
organization
such
and
such.
So,
we
can
certify
on
behalf
of
this
company
X
that
the
product
A
is
both
qualitatively
as
well
as
purity;
quality
as
well
as
purity
of
the
product
is
absolutely
fine
and
there
is
no
complaint;
that
is
certified
by
AGMARK.
It
acts
as
a
third
party
guarantee
and
this
is
the
third
party
that
is
the
AGMARK
is
those
third
party
acting
for
the
company
X,
that
the
product
A
which
the
company
X
prepared,
manufactured,
sold
to
the
consumer
is
both
purity
and
quality
are
absolutely
at
par
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
country .
6Quality
standards
for
agricultural
commodities
are
framed
based
on
commodities
intrinsic
quality .
And
food
safety
factors
are
being
incorporated
in
the
standards
to
compete
in
the
world
trade.
As
I
gave
the
example
in
other
class
that
company
has
exported
certain
things
which
were
discarded
by
the
importer;
right?
This
is
just
not
like
that
for
without
rhymes
and
reasoning
somebody
can
discard
or
accept.
So,
discarding
he
is
also
based
on
certain
fraction,
figures
or
regulations
or
acts;
if
they
are
not
being
adhere
to,
then
that
importer
may
have
the
right
to
discard
or
throw
your
return,
the
consignment
or
the
import
which
was
exported
by
a
company
X
from
a
country .
So,
it
is
the
importing
countries
framework,
rules
and
regulations
that
will
control.
So,
if
this
AGMARK
is
not
sufficiently
reach
to
encompass
the
food
laws
governed
by
the
importing
countries;
then
it
will
not
match
with
that
and
get
rejected.
So,
that
is
why
that
the
implementation,
that
is
why
regulating,
that
is
why
monitoring
or
framing
up
these
standards,
these
base
by
the
by
the
AGMARK
is
or
has
to
be
of
high
quality ,
of
high
standard
so,
that
international
trade;
it
can
encounter
or
it
can
face
the
international
trade.
Then
only
this
import
export
or
export
import
this
business
can
developed
and
this
can
be
supported
by
the,
this
standardizing
agency
like
AGMARK.

Then
we
look
into
that
the
standards
are
being
harmonized
with
international
standards
keeping
in
view
the
requirements
of
World
Trade
Organization
or
WTO.
Certification
of
agricultural
commodities
is
carried
out
by
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
product
or
producer ,
manufacturer
or
manufactured
item
as
well
as
consumer .
So,
certification
of
agricultural
commodities
is
carried
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
producer
or
manufacturer
as
well
as
the
consumer .
So,
this
certification
by
the
this
third
party
agency;
that
third
party
organization
that
saying
that
this
typical
product
is
good
at
par
with
the
norms
and
regulations
laid
down
by
this
say,
this
AGMARK
agency
or
AGMARK
organization
that
is
that
is
following
the
quality
of
the
standard
as
well
as
the
purity
of
the
standard
and
it
is
acceptable.
So,
this
authentication
or
this
certification
is
to
be
made
at
par
with
the
World
Trade
Organization
or
WTO
so
that
the
import
export
this
business
can
sustained
or
justify .
Products
available
under
AGMARK
all
like
this;
pulses,
whole
and
ground
spices,
vegetable
oils,
wheat
products,
milk
products,
honey
etcetera.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:39)
Food
products
as
the
honey
etcetera
etcetera.
Now ,
some
other
organizations
like
Food
Product
Order
or
FPO,
1955.
So,
this
food
product
order
or
FPO;
this
is
the
1955
Act
or
it
was
established
in
1955.
So,
the
FPO
mark
is
the
certification
mark
in
many
products;
you
8
will
see
that
at
the
end
or
on
some
it
is
written
that
FPO
is
there
on
the
as
authenticated
or
certified
right
that
FPO
as
symbol,
as
well
as
that
the
word
FPO
is
written.
So,
this
implies
that
the
product
is
certified
by
the
agency
or
controlling
agency
called
FPO
right.
So,
the
FPO
mark
is
certification
mark
mediatory
on
all
process
food
products
sold
in
India;
such
as
packaged
food
beverages,
fruit
jams,
crushes
and
squashes,
pickles,
dehydrated
fruit
products
and
fruit
extracts;
following
the
Food
Safety
and
Standard
or
FSS
Act,
2006.
And
the
objectives
of
the
FPO
are;
the
main
objective
of
a
FPO
is
to
lay
down
quality
standards
to
manufacture
fruit
and
vegetable
products
maintaining
sanitary
and
hygienic
conditions
in
the
premises.
Let
me
finish
this
then
I
will
discuss;
it
is
mandatory
for
all
manufacturers
of
fruit
and
vegetables
products
including
some
non
fruit
products
like
non
fruit
vinegar ,
syrup
and
aerated
sweetened
water
to
obtain
a
license
under
this
order .
So,
this
is
also
FPO
that
is
fruit
products
order
it
is
1955
Act.
So,
basically
it
is
controlling
the
fruits
and
vegetables
this
umbrella
and
their
products
made
of
made
of
fruits
and
vegetables;
idle
either
has
a
whole
some
or
maybe
some
processed
from
there
right.
So,
this
in
many
branded
items
or
many
companies
product
which
are
packed;
on
the
packet
you
as
I
said,
you
may
find
that
FPO;
it
also
has
a
certain
mark
and
also
that
FPO
word
that
righting
is
there
that
this
corroborates
that
the
product
is
at
par
right.
So,
it
is
mandatory
for
all
manufacturer
of
fruits
and
vegetables
producing
a
producers
including
some
non
fruit
producing.
And
now
in
this
case
we
give
the
example
of
fruit
vinegar
right?
Non
fruit
vinegar
and
fruit
vinegar;
now
vinegar
as
we
know
this
is
nothing,
but
4
percent
acetic
acid
right.
So,
it
can
be
prepared
synthetically
and
it
can
be
prepared
through
some
fruits
and
vegetables.
So,
in
that
case
or
the
fruits;
so
by
fermentation
it
can
be
prepared;
obviously ,
the
test
another
things
altogether
are
different,
but
this
FPO
has
a
guideline,
has
a
standard
which
will
tell
that
product
A
is
made
of
synthetic
vinegar
and
the
product
B
is
made
of
fermentation
right?
Because
vinegar
by
itself
is
4
percent
acetic
acid;
so
acetic
acid
content
is
4
percent,
but
smell
wise,
test
wise,
liking
all
these
are
different
for
the
2
as
guided
by
the
FPO.
So,
this
is
another
certifying
agency
or
organization
which
certifies
food
products
like
products;
either
as
a
whole
made
of
fruits
and
vegetables
or
products
made
out
of
them
ok.
