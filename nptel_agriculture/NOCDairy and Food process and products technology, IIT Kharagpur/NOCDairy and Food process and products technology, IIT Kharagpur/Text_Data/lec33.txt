Lactoferrin
So,
in
this
class
of
Dairy
and
Food
Products;
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
T echnology
in
33rd
class
we
will
go
to
Lactoferrin.
But
before
we
go
to
the
next
this
thing
lactoferrin;
I
would
like
to
go
back
a
little
because
I
feel
you
also
might
have
seen
you
have
also
might
have
heard
and
seen
that
in
the
previous
class
towards
the
absolutely
towards
the
end,
I
was
feeling
a
little
sleepy
a
little
and
obviously ,
that
was
not
desirable.
But
let
me
go
through
quickly
that
we
were
talking
about
Proteose,
Peptone
and
Peptide
what
are
they
and
what
are
the
dif ferences
if
they
have
at
all
right.
And
we
also
said
that
the
peptide
bond
is
nothing,
but
OC-NH
right
that
C
N
bond
is
the
peptide
bond;
obviously ,
it
should
also
have
one
O
with
the
C
and
NH
right;
that
is
that
carbonyl
group
and
the
NH
group,
they
are
together
bonded
to
CN
right.
And
the
basic
definition
of
the
all
proteose,
peptone,
peptide
are
similar .
Peptone
is
a
soluble
protein
formed
in
the
early
basic;
early
stage
of
the
protein
breakdown,
during
digestion
process
and
pepsin
converts
these
proteins
to
peptone
and
proteose
and
peptides
right.
So,
this
if
we;
if
we
recapitulate
a
little
and
then
we
go
to
our
today
that
other
protein
that
is
whey
proteins
are
like
lactoferrin.
Lactoferrin
is
another
protein;
whey
protein
which
is
globular
glycoprotein,
globular
glycoprotein
of
course,
from
the
name
glycoprotein
you
can
understand
that
it
is
both
you
have
glycolysis;
glycosidic
linkage
and
this
is
glycoprotein
in
the
protein
right?
And
it
is
around
74
kilo
Dalton
and
binds
to
iron
right.
And
iron
that
is
the
heme
one
basic
constituent
of
the
of
the
blood
is
the
basic
constituent
of
the
blood
heme,
iron
is
a
NIP;
that
is
why
milk
which
has
very
low
when
we
will
go
to
the
elements
or
metals
or
minerals
which
are
present
in
milk,
that
time
we
will
see
that
milk
contains
many
many
minerals,
but
iron
is
very
very
poor
right.
So,
but
this
iron
is
also
required
for
binding
with
the
with
the
with
the
proteins
and
that
here
it
is
also
that
globular
glycoprotein
lactoferrin
which
is
74
kilo
Dalton
and
by
end
it
is
bound
through
iron
Fe
right.
So,
as
it
contains
2
metal
binding
sites;
bovine
milk
contains
approximately
20
to
200
milligram
per
litre
this
lactoferrin,
20
to
200
milligram
per
litre
variations
are;
obviously ,
there.
There
are
many
reasons
for
those
and
they
are;
it
is
not
that
all
reasons
are
identical,
but;
obviously ,
this
is
a
number
which
is
giving
the
range
right.
So,
depending
on
the
source,
depending
on
the
type
etcetera
etcetera
that
may
vary
this
lactoferrin
content
it
is
around
20
to
200
milligram
per
litre.
Human
milk
contains
around
only
2
gram
per
litre;
so,
bovine
milk
contains
much
more
lactoferrin
than
human
milk
right.
Other
minor
protein
includes
some
growth
factors;
so
there
are
many
growth
factors
in
our
body
system.
I
repeatedly
say
that
you
please
also
consult
that
book
of
biochemistry
by
Lehninger;
so,
there
you
will
also
see
this
very
very
dif ferent
types
of
growth
factors
are
also
there.
So,
those
growth
factors
are
also
part
of
this
whey
protein,
vitamin
binding
proteins
like
Foliate,
V itamin
D,
Riboflavin
and
V itamin
B
12.
So,
these
are
also
present
and
also
and
this
one
that
Angiogenins;
angiogenins
and
Osteopontin;
osteopontin
these
are
also
present
as
the
whey
protein
right.So,
after
that
let
us
look
into
that
unlike
casein;
coagulates
by
heat
treatment,
but
not
by
rennet
right;
casein
is
coagulated
by
rennin
or
rennet
that
is
an
enzyme
which
is
available
in
the
in
the
in
the
in
the
stomach
of
the
calf
right.
In
the
stomach
of
the
calf,
this
enzyme
is
available
and
this
is
rennet
or
rennin
which
that
is
why
we
are
saying
that
unlike
casein;
which
is
precipitated
by
the
action
of
the
rennet
or
rennin,
this
does
not
right,
but
it
is
coagulating
by
heat
treatment.
Y ou
remember
while
we
had
said
that
how
dif ferent
ways,
we
can
identify
the
components
of
the
components
of
the
milk
constituents;
right
how
we
can
identify .
There
we
are
said
that
when
you
got
the
whey
separated
and
heat
the
whey ,
then
you
get
some
turbidity
that
is
what
by
heat
coagulate
is
called
heat
coagulation.
So,
by
adding
heat;
by
applying
heat
you
are
coagulating
this
protein
or
whey
protein
is
coagulated
right;
so,
but
not
by
the
rennet,
but
not
by
rennet
right.
Maybe
in
colloidal
state
or
in
true
solution
right,
this
may
be
available
in
colloidal
state
or
in
true
solution.
Common
use
of
the
whey
protein
is
yet
to
find
out
because
as
I
said
earlier
also
perhaps
that
the
recovery
of
whey
protein;
whey
protein
how
much
you
have?
It’ s
around
20
percent;
20
percent
of
what?
4
percent;
so,
20
percent
of
4
percent
is
around
0.8
right;
so,
0.8
say
gram
100
gram
of
milk;
so
to
recover
this
if
the
recovery
process
is
not;
is
not
cheap
or
cheaper
or
is
not
af fordable
then
or
after
recovery ,
if
the
product
price
is
more
than
the
recovery
or
rather
less
than
the
recovery
price,
then
the
recovery
has
no
meaning.
And
that
is
why
till
date
people
have
not
tried
recovering
it
much.
But
again
there
are
many
such
problems
which
are
for
you;
so,
in
future
you
come
across,
you
come
forward
and
try
to
separate
them
and
make
use
of
it.
T ill
now
it
is
not
a
consolidated
af ford
of
making
the
use
of
this
whey
protein
has
been
made;
like
the
casein
which
we
have
seen
innumerable,
it
has
innumerable
uses
and
there
caseins
are
having
lot
of
applications
right.
Other
proteins
also
lactoglobulin,
fibrin,
alcohol
soluble
proteins
are
also
present
in
milk.
Now ,
we
come
to
another
one
which
is
the
carbohydrate
family
right.
The
other
day
I
had
said
that
milk
is
the
only
one
where
or
only
natural
product
where
a
single
component
like
lactose
is
present;
carbohydrate.
This
we
say
the
reason
being
the
carbohydrate
which
is
present
in
milk
is
basically
all
lactose.
Others
are
very
very
small
in
quantity;
is
virtually
negligible
that
is
why
by
and
lar ge
milk
lower
carbohydrate
corresponds
to
lactose
only .
Several
carbohydrates
are
there
in
milk
such
as
lactose,
glucose,
galactose
and
this
lactose
is
made
of
glucose
and
galactose.
So,
on
hydrolysis
by
any
way
maybe
by
heat
or
by
any
way
if
it
is
hydrolyzing,
then
it
will
give
that
glucose
and
galactose
which
are
also
present
in
milk,
but
in
very
very
small
quantity
right.
Glycoconjugates
are
like
oligosachharides;
glycoprotiens,
glycoaminoglycans;
aminoglycans
all
these
are
also
present.
Main
carbohydrate
is
lactose
4
to
45
percent;
total
present
in
milk
rather
it
should,
it
should
have
been
it
should
have
been
maybe
typographical
mistake
it
is
40
to
45
percent
or
like
that
total
that
lactose
main
carbohydrate
is
lactose
around
4
to
5
not
45.
So,
it
is
5;
4
to
5
percent
of
the
total
milk
it
is
present.
So,
it
is
4
to
5
percent
of
the
whole
total
milk
present
is
lactose
and
glucose,
galactose,
oligosachharides
approximately
around
1
point;
1
milligram
per
milliliter ,
1
milligram
per
milliliter
right;
4
to
5
grams
per
100
gram,
out
of
which
1
milliliter
per
1
milligram
per
milliliter
that
is
your
1000
milligrams
per
litre
1000
milliliter
is
1
litre.
So,
1000
milligram
per
litre
that
is
1
gram
per
100;
1
gram
per
litre
that
is
or
rather
it
should
be
0.1
gram
per
100
gram
right,
1
milligram
per
ml
that
should
correspond
to
roughly
0.1
milligram
or
0.1
gram
rather
per
100
gram
right.
So,
this
milligram
you
convert
it
to
gram;
so
it
is
1000
grams,
1000
milligram
that
is
1
gram
is
equivalent
to;
is
equivalent
to
1000
ml
that
is
1
litre
right
1
litre
roughly
is
equal
to
1
kg.
So,
it
is
1
1000
milligram
that
is
1
gram
in
1
kg;
that
means,
0.1
gram
in
100
grams
right.
So,
that’ s
what
I
am
saying
that
0.1
gram
in
100
gram
of
milk,
it
is
present
right
which
is
very
very
negligible
that
is
why
again
and
again
I
am
saying
that
lactose
is
the
main
constituent
of
the
carbohydrate
present
in
milk
right,
others
are
negligible.
So,
though
and
that
it
is
not
that
mainly
they
are
glucose
and
galactose
which
is
the
hydrolyzed
product
of
the
lactose;
so,
in
any
case
it
could
be,
but
their
presence
is
very
very
small
in
quantity .
So,
milk
sugar
which
we
normally
know
as
the
milk
sugar
which
normally
we
know
as
the
lactose
right.
So,
which
is
a
disachcharide
and
it
has
it
is
alpha
lactose
monohydrate,
beta
lactose
and
anhydrous
alpha
lactose;
so,
alpha
lactose
monohydrate
I
hope
you
understand
right.
So,
lactose
this
with
1
H
2
O
has
the
hydration
is
the
monohydrate
right
whereas,
anhydrous
beta
lactose
means
there
is
no
hydration
that
is
there
is
no
H
2
O
associated
with
that
right;
so,
if
that
be;
then
beta
lactose
has
greater
solubility
and
is
sweeter
than
alpha
lactose.
Beta
lactose
is
greater
soluble
and
much
sweeter
than
that
of
alpha
lactose;
major
food
source
this
is
the
major
food
source
for
bacteria
during
fermentation
of
food
and
this
beta
lactose
is
that,
that
is
a
major
source.
Bacteria
hydrolyzed
milk
into
glucose
and
galactose
right
to
produce
lactic
acid
right,
which
inhibits
the
growth
of
most
other
microor ganisms.
Once
this
bacteria
is
producing
lactic
acid
from
lactose,
then
that
produced
lactic
acid
does
not
allow
many
or ganisms
to
come
forward
or
to
invade
the
milk
and
spoil
that
way ,
but
if
it
is
by
lactic
acid
bacteria.
So,
if
you
recall
some
other
day
I
had
said
that
if
you
keep
milk
just
like
that
and
if
it
gets
spoiled,
then
normally
we
don’ t
consume
because
we
don’ t
know ,
but
ifyou
put
lactic
acid
bacteria
and
if
that
produces
lactic
acid;
then
if
it
curdles
then
you
know
that
it
is
by
lactic
acid
bacteria
and
it
was
lactic
acid
which
curdled.
So,
that
time
it
is
not
that
unsafe,
but
unknowingly
if
you
take
then
you
don’ t
know ,
but
if
lactic
acid
producing
or ganisms
are
there
then
or
rather
if
lactic
bacteria
is
converting
this
lactose
to
the
lactic
acid,
then
that
lactic
acid
does
not
allow
other
or ganisms
to
grow
in
the
milk
right.
Because
they
do
not
tolerate
high
lactic
acid
concentration
right;
then
which
inhibits
the
growth
of
most
of
the
other
or ganisms;
solubility
of
lactose
is
one
third
that
of
the
sucrose
at
100
degree
centigrade
right,
solubility
is
also
much
lower
than
that
of
the
sucrose
this
lactose.
Prolong
heating
at
100
to
300
degree
centigrade
decomposes
this
lactose
and
which
is
indicated
by
a
light
brown
caramel
colour ,
that
decomposition
is
indicated
by
light
brown
caramel
colour .
This
you
know
that
light
brown
caramel
colour
we
said
earlier
that
is
primary
due
to
the;
due
to
caramelization
that
browning,
browning
reaction
by
caramelization
right.
Then
we
come
in
the
presence
of
bacteria,
it
is
easily
decomposed
as
C
12
H
22
O
1 1
that
is
the
lactic
acid
plus
H
2
O
that
bacteria
is
fermenting
or
acting
on
it,
then
it
is
producing
4
C
3
H
6
O
3
that
is
the
lactic
acid
4
C

And
surprisingly ,
you
will
see
that
1
gram
of
lactose
by
the
bacterial
decomposition
forms
around
0.8
gram
of
lactic
acid.
Y ou
see
is
80
percent
conversion,
1
gram
of
lactose
is
converted
into
0.8
gram
of
lactic
acid
by
lactic
acid
producing
bacteria
right.
So,
this
is
almost
80
percent
conversion
and
that
is
why
that
it
is
coagulated
so
easily
by
this
acid
producing
or ganisms
right.
So,
in
general
around
10
to
30
percent
of
the
sugar
is
used
in
the
normal
souring
of
milk.
So,
only
10
to
30
percent
because
the;
for
this
is
not
in
this
our
class
that
in
the
growth
phase,
in
the
growth
of
the
microbiology
or
microbes;
you
will
see
that
they
follow
this
kind
of
growth
curve
right.
So,
there
is
a
lag
period
and
then
growth
period
and
then
it
is
the;
it
is
the
decay
period.
So,
that
growth
curve
we
will
see
that
here
it
is
10
to
30
percent
maximum
is
utilized
for
the
conversion;
normally
for
souring
of
the
milk
that
is
conversion
of
lactose
to
lactic
acid.
Dry
milk
contains
a
very
high
percentage
of
lactose
because
it
is
with
respect
to
dry
basis
approximately
around
38
to
40
percent.
Because
it
is
dried
instantaneously
lactose
does
not
crystallize,
but
forms
a
lactose
glass
or
that
is
called
the
glassy
state.
That
is
why
again
and
again
I
am
saying
that
that
is
why
before
you
proceed
further
for
processing
milk,
you
must
have
the
idea
about
the
glass
transition
temperature;
that
is
that
transformation
of
this
to
glassy
state
lactose
to
glassy
state
without
forming
the
crystal.
So,
this
glassy
state
what
is
the
temperature
of
the
glass
transition;
if
you
don’ t
know
before
and
then
during
the
processing
that
lactose
may
create
problem
forming
the
glassy
state
on
the
walls
of
the
container
or
on
the
vessels
or
on
the
equipments,
thereby
it
will
act
as
a
protecting
agent
against
heat.
So,
the
necessarily
heat
or
cold
whatever
it
may
be,
but
in
if
let;
if
it
is
glass
transition
then
mostly
it
will
be
heat
and
thereby
you
are
losing
the
ef ficiency
of
the
system.
So,
you
must
know
the
glass
transition
temperature
of
the
lactose
right.Then
we
come
that
lactose
is
also
very
hygroscopic
under
high
RH,
will
rapidly
take
up
this
under
high
RH;
let
me
clear
up
this
lines,
yes
under
high
RH
will
rapidly
take
up
water
diluting
lactose
glass
to
the
point
where
it
becomes
sticky
and
finally ,
crystallization
of
alpha
lactose
occurs
resulting
to
a
hard
caked
powder;
which
is
a
serious
defect
in
the
product
ok.
Then
the
other
things
which
are
present
in
milk
are
the
ash
or
mineral
content;
ash
or
mineral
metal
that
is
how
it
is
expressed,
but
subsequently
we
will
see
that
the
mineral
contents
are
not
the
ash
content
right.
However ,
milky
ash
contains
sodium;
milk
ash
contains
sodium,
potassium,
calcium,
magnesium,
chlorine
or
chloride
phosphorus,
sulphur
and
in
these
are
relatively
in
lar ge
amount;
lar ge
quantity;
very
small
quantity
iron,
copper ,
zinc,
aluminium,
manganese,
cobalt
and
iodine
and
traces
quantities
of
the;
these
are
the
intermediate
that
in
your
in
your
periodic
table,
you
will
see
that
transition
elements
many
of
them
not
the
silicon
silicon
boron
they
are
below
that.
Silicon,
boron,
titanium,
vanadium,
rubidium,
lithium
and
strontium
they
are
present
in
traces
quantities.
Now
parts
of
this
calcium
and
phosphorus
are
combined
with
proteins
calcium
as
calcium
caseinate
right
calcium
as
calcium
caseinate
and
phosphorus
also
as
phosphoprotein
right.
So,
they
are
mostly
associated
with
protein
calcium
and
phosphorus;
remaining
proteins
together
with
magnesium
are
partly
in
suspension
and
partly
in
solution.
Small
portion
of
sulphur
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
casein
and
lactalbumin.
Milk
is
low
in
iron
very
low
in
iron
and
for
this
reason
would
not
supply
all
the
needs
of
an
adult
right;
that
is
why
milk
is
not
complete
food
because
of
the
deficiency
of
the
iron;
had
it
will
that
iron
is
not
so
deficient,
then
it
could
have
been
a
complete
food
right.
So,
if
it
has
to
be
made
complete;
so
iron
has
to
be
supplemented
or
augmented
right.
So,
iron
has
to
be
given
to
the
milk
then
only
it
becomes
a
complete
food.
Right
then
minerals
in
milk
is
about
0.7
to
0.8
percent,
it
is
around
0.7
to
0.8
percent
minerals
in
milk;
whereas,
sodium,
potassium,
chloride
they
are
present
as
free
ions
sodium,
potassium
and
chloride
represent
in
free
ion
which
are
readily
dif fusible
and
their
concentrations
are
negatively
correlated
with
lactose.
The
concentrations
of
calcium,
magnesium,
ionized
phosphate
and
citrate;
this
depends
on
the
casein
content
of
the
milk.
Concentration
of
citrate
that
varies
depending
on
the
season
and
feed
of
the
animal
cow
or
whatever
the
mammalian
is
mostly
true;
which
af fect
the
soluble
calcium
content
and
the
milk
stability .
Equilibrium
between
colloidal
dispersion
and
salts
also
influence
on
that;
if
the
colloidal
equilibrium
is
destabilized,
then
this
is
destabilized
by
the
concentration
of
the
minerals
may
af fect.
This
concentration
of
minerals
may
af fect
processing
which
require
addition
of
anions
to
bind
to
ionic
calcium
that
would
restabilize
the
casein
against
aggregation;
that
is
casein
is
not
allowed
to
aggregate
right.
So,
we
are
at
the
end
of
the
class
this.
So,
we
must
thank
and
complete
it
today .
Thank
you.
