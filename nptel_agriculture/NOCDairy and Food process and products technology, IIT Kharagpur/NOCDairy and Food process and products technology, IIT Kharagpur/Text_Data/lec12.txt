Why
We
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
in
this
course
today
it
is
to
be
discussed
Food
Laws,
right.
So,
food
laws
we
will
discuss
and
so,
there
the
first
thing
comes
why
the
food
laws
are
required,
what
is
that?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:39)
Because
law
as
such
we
are
accustomed
that
there
are
many
laws
in
our
country ,
there
are
many
courts
in
our
country .
And
they
decide
on
many
many
aspects
many
many
factors.
Then
why
suddenly
food
laws
are
coming
in
being,
that
question
comes
in
mind?
Because
this
is
one
where
we
are
consuming,
right?
Then
what
is
the
point
of
introducing
certain
laws
regulations
boards
this
that
many
others;
obviously ,
this
implies
that
till
now
whatever
we
have
seen
that
when
you
are
consuming
any
food
any
food
item,
for
your
nutrition,
for
your
growth,
for
sustenance,
whatever
be
the
reason,
whatever
be
the
source;
whether
it
is
from
plant
origin
or
from
animal
origin,
if
the
processors,
not
only
processors,
if
the
processors,
distributors,
1
suppliers,
retailers
at
every
stage,
if
there
is
any
change
in
quality
in
whatever
be
the
aspect
that
the
term
in
way
we
are
defined
equality .
So,
in
that
quality
whatever
be
the
change
in
quality
if
there,
we
then
(1)
who
will
be
held
responsible
and
how
number
1.
(2)
how
can
we
prevent
or
protect
against
such
kind
of
changes?
Suppose
after
consuming
a
food,
somebody
fail
sick,
then
who
will
dictate
whether
the
person
was
originally
sick,
and
this
consumption
has
no
meaning
in
imparting
any
such
kind
of
sickness
in
him
or
her,
or
really
by
consuming
that
particular
thing
the
person
became
sick
or
ill.
Then
who
is
to
be
blamed?
How
to
be
blamed?
So,
those
things
if
are
not
defined
if
are
not
guided
by
certain
principles
by
certain
laws
by
certain
orders
then
it
is
very
difficult
to
control.
So,
to
control
the
entire
gamut
of
food
in
it
is
original
form
or
in
any
form
after
processing
or
any
form
after
handling
directly
or
indirectly .
So,
those
things
are
to
be
known.
So,
in
this
we
said
food
in
the
earlier
classes
that
when
we
go
to
food
laws,
it
will
be
a
little
informative
then
more
informative
then
understanding,
but
realizing
is
also
required.
So,
it
is
not
only
information,
but
also
realizing
why,
why
things
are
being
imposed,
why
and
why
if
not,
then
what
would
happen,
right.
So,
then
if
you
look
at
the
objectives
of
the
food
laws
to
meet
a
country’ s
sanitary
and
phytosanitary
requirements,
right.
So,
phytosanitary
another
term
we
are
introducing.
So,
that
phytosanitary
terms
at
or
aims
at
the
conditions
of
the
surrounding
plant
origin
or
plant
kingdom,
right.
So,
to
meet
a
country’ s
sanitary
and
phytosanitary
requirements,
food
must
comply
with
the
local
laws
and
regulations
to
gain
market
access,
right.
So,
if
there
is
no
such
laws,
no
such
regulatory
is
in
the
country ,
then
it
may
cause
some
chaotics
in
situations,
chaotic
moments
in
the
country
at
any
part
of
the
country .
So,
if
they
if
the
there
is
no
binding;
binding
in
terms
of
laws,
then
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
control
the
sanitary
and
phytosanitary
conditions
of
the
country ,
right.
So,
what
are
the
factors
on
which
it
depends?
Of
course,
in
some
countries
this
may
be
dependent
on
the
international
whatever
is
going
on
international
control
mechanism
or
international
rules
and
regulations,
that
depends
on
the
country
itself.
It
may
be
that
2international
boards
are
or
regulatory
authorities,
they
have
framed
certain
rules
and
regulations.
So,
country
can
totally
based
on
that,
and
follow
the
requirements,
but
depending
on
the
country ,
they
may
a
deviate
and
or
they
may
keep
and/or
impose
some
variations
or
some
new
things
in
to
those.
Or
could
be
entirely
they
have
their
own
methods
of
controlling,
right.
So,
in
some
countries
food
laws
also
given
are
governed
by
food
quality ,
right?
Food
laws
also
governed
food
qualities.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:46)
The
requirement
of
food
regulation
may
be
based
on
several
factors,
for
example,
whether
a
country
adopts
international
norms
developed
by
Codex,
alimentarius
commission
of
the
food
and
agriculture
organization
that
is
the
FAO
of
the
united
nations
or
UN,
and
the
world
health
organization
WHO,
right.
So,
all
this
governing
bodies
constitute
this
Codex
alimentarius.
Because
that
is
the
international
bodies
which
control
the
entire
thing
Codex.
This
is
the
list
of
dos
and
don’ts
and
many
many
things
which
are
there,
right.
So,
that
is
being
controlled
by
may
be
international
bodies
like
FAO
by
UN
by
WHO.
So,
if
a
country
yours
to
totally
avoid
by
these
code
of,
this
is
I
mean
Codex
or
alimentarius
means,
this
is
the
laws
of
food
or
food
laws.
So,
these
food
laws
as
governed
by
these
international
body
can
be
as
such
as
a
whole
complied
by
the
country
3
or
if
the
country ,
once
they
can
also
take
part
of
it
or
whole
of
it
along
with
maybe
some
part
of
their
or
whole
of
their
depending
on
the
countries
requirement
or
the
intention
of
the
country .
So,
a
country
may
also
have
it
is
own
suit
of
food
regulations.
So,
entirely
it
is
different,
that
these
are
the
situations
when
food
laws
are
coming,
and
a
country
can
totally
do
the
entire
thing
depending
on
their
requirements
depending
on
their
controlling
or
controlling
or
the
monitoring
institutions
or
at
the
agencies,
right.
So,
why
we
need
food
safety
standards?
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:33)
There
is
the
first
question
is
coming
in
mind,
that
the
why
we
need,
right?
So,
right
from
the
term,
safe
food;
so,
safe
food
that
represents
different
ideas
to
different
audiences,
what
you
fill
safe
may
not
be
filled
by
me,
what
I
feel
may
not
be
felt
by
some
other ,
right.
So,
until
and
unless,
we
all
are
said
do
not
know
this
is
what,
safe
means
this
is
what
we
mean
what
is
a
safe
food
until,
and
unless
there
is
one
umbrella,
right.
Then
everything
will
not
be
encompassed
and
not
that
umbrella,
because
your
perception
my
perception
somebody
else’s
perception
about
the
thing
may
or
may
not
be
different,
right.
So,
who
are
at
stake
number
one
is
the
primarily
consumers
who
are
consuming,
number
2
the
special
entire
the
special
interest
groups,
means,
some
group
they
might
have
some
typical
special
interest,
or
some
regulatory
bodies
or
regulators
may
be
by
4
industry
and
academia
year
the
entire
gamut
of
the
m
academy
who
may
have
some
academic
interest
on
that.
So,
these
we
these
different
agencies
or
different
classes
we
will
have
their
unique
description
based
on
their
perception.
So,
academia
will
tell
quality
in
one
term
in
one
parameter
in
one
way
or
it,
it
may
not
be
single
parameter ,
may
be
multiples
of
parameter
parameters.
But
industry
also
will
look
into
in
their
way.
Some
controlling
agency
we
will
tell
that
perception
in
their
way.
Some
consumers
and
regulators
they
also
may
tell
in
their
own
way.
So,
depending
on
who
is
looking
into
it
that
will
dictate
what
the
food
safe
we
mean
or
is
meant.
It
should
be
that
everybody
is
telling
the
same.
Otherwise
suppose
you
are
singing
a
song
in
a
tune
which
is
totally
different
from
my
tune,
and
with
a
maybe
same
song
with
a
different
tune
by
somebody
else,
and
all
of
us
are
singing,
but
all
different
tunes.
Then
will
it
become
a
music,
no.
It
will
become
a
chaotics
situation,
nobody
you
would
like
to
listen
that.
And
similar
conditions
also
arising
here
that
consumer
is
pursuing
that
what
is
safe
food
in
one
way,
industry
people
who
are
processing
their
thinking
in
another
aspect
another
perception,
the
controlling
body
is
their
looking
into
in
other
perception.
So,
if
all
this
perception
should
boil
down
to
unique
perception
so
that
this
is
embedded
in
a
definite
frame,
right.
So,
food
safety
is
an
issue
of
growing
importance
due
to
several
worldwide
trends
in
food
system.
I
believe
you
are
now
around
say
18
to
22
somewhere,
right,
even
a
decade
back
whatever
food
or
even
more
than
decade,
whatever
food
was
come
on
living
used
or
was
popular
with
the
change
of
the
decade
or
with
the
change
of
time,
that
is
going
on
changing
maybe
day
by
day
or
month
by
month
or
year
by
year
depending
on
the
particular
item
or
varieties,
but
what
test
and
liking
are
also
getting
changed,
right.
So,
it
becomes
here
worldwide
trend
in
the
food
system
which
is
gradually
getting
changed,
right?
Who
are
getting
affected?
The
growing
people
or
moment
of
the
people,
live
animals,
food
products
across
the
borders,
rapid
urbanization,
this
is
also
one
of
because
in
developing
countries
there
is
rapid
urbanization
so,
the
changes
in
the
test
5bars
or
in
the
liking
or
influence
of
others
that
is
being
taking
much
more
rapidly
where
urbanization
is
being
taking
place.
Then
changes
in
food
handling,
again
I
come
back
to
decades
back,
when
things
were
not
there
much
common
in
advertisement.
Nowadays
advertisement
is
also
or
media
is
also
becoming
such
a
powerful
tool
that
people
are
coming
to
know
changing
their
minds
getting
affected
being
influenced
by
looking
at
those
things,
right.
And
the
emer gence
of
new
pathogen
or
antibiotic,
during
our
studentship
we
had
heard
that
this
penicillin
when
it
was
in
invest
invented
that
type,
it
was
one
of
the
one
of
the
breakthrough
by
which
human
being
or
mankind
was
really
benefited,
right.
And
this
was
the
real
broad-spectrum
antibiotic.
After
was
many
derivatives
of
those
penicillin
they
came
up
right,
but
keep
in
mind
that
today
the
organisms
which
are
getting
destroyed
by
a
particular
antibiotic,
tomorrow
that
antibiotic
may
or
may
not
be
fruitful
or
effective
on
that
organism,
right.
So,
that
Darwin’ s
theory
everywhere
it
is
applicable.
So,
that
organism
may
gradually
get
mutated,
and
may
become
resistant
to
that
organ
that
typical
antibiotic,
and
it
will
not
be
that
easy
or
the
antibiotic
to
destroy
the
organism.
So,
pathogen
antibiotic
these
things
are
also
come
into
being.
And
they
are
becoming
the
pathogens
are
becoming
antibiotic
resistant,
right?
And
they
are
all
contributing
to
the
risk
factor
of
the
consumption
of
the
food,
right.
So,
that
is
why
the
food
safety
typically
is
nowadays
real
concern
of
both
consumer ,
processor
and
the
regulators,
right.
And
the
liberalization
trade
and
growing
number
of
imported
food
stuffs
to
increase
the
food
safety
risk
is
also
there
right.
So,
things
have
become
more
and
more
liberalized.
So,
in
that
case
the
imported
things
or
exported
whatever
bit
be
the
case
imported
things
for
a
particular
country
is
becoming
day
by
day
concerned
about
the
risk.
So,
we
must
be
capable
of
fighting
those
situations
where
these
things
may
occur
right?.
6(Refer

Time:

So,
inadequate
food
safety
is
a
significant
contribute
to
the
burden
of
disease
in
different
countries,
and
should
be
addressed
as
the
food
system
develops
and
along
with
related
investments
in
public
health.
Basic
sanitation
and
water
services
may
be
a
prerequisite
for
addressing
many
food
safety
hazards,
right.
So,
right
from
the
water
as
well
the
basic
system
of
how
developing
countries
or
developed
countries
are
handling
with
the
hazards
associated
with
food.
So,
they
are
nowadays
becoming
more
and
more
concerned
about
the
safety
of
the
food
items.
Now ,
again
and
again
safety
in
terms
of
after
consuming
the
food
person
should
not
become
in
anyway
sick
or
should
not
be
affected.
That
is
the
primary
concern
about
the
safety
right;
obviously ,
this
is
the
frontal
side,
but
on
the
backside
there
are
many
others
again
the
quality
terms.
They
come
in
being
into
being
that,
along
with
this
that
is
the
pathological
safety
or
along
with
the
microbial
safety
of
the
food
material,
the
nutritional
safety
is
as
equally
associated
with
the
safety
world,
right?
Now ,
industrialization
of
agricultural
production
and
increase
in
the
number
of
food
services
is
establishment,
tourism,
organization
with
subsequent
changes
in
lifestyles.
Food
consumption
pattern
and
food
preparation
practices
require
high
level
of
food
safety
standards,
right.
The
things
which
we
just
told,
that
all
this
aspects
the
tourism,
7
yes,
different
people
are
coming
from
different
areas,
of
different
nature,
of
different
health
different
culture
everything;
so,
lifestyle
of
that
or
in
general
others
lifestyle.
So,
in
organization
that
is
also
changing
the
lifestyle.
So,
everywhere
if
we
if
the
country
has
to
have
some
control
over
the
thin
food
consumed
about
the
safety
part
the
standards
must
be
there
for
that
country
to
regulate,
to
monitor
the
entire
thing
right.
So,
for
this
reason
we
can
say
that
food
safety
standards
at
high
level
must
be
practiced
in
any
developed
countries
the
developing
countries
whatever
it
be.

Time:

Then
we
come
that
what
are
the
food
laws
in
India,
now
the
Indian
parliament
has
recently ,
recently
means
very
recently
maybe
one
decade
earlier ,
pass
the
food
safety
and
standard
act
2006
that
overrides
all
other
food
related
laws.
For
example,
this
laws
may
are
also
this
FSS,
which
we
are
talking
about
that
food
safety
and
standard,
this
act
2006
that
encompasses
all
of
this,
but
it
is
overriding.
This
laws
also
like
prevention
of
food
adulteration
act
1954,
food
products
order
1955,
meat
products
meat
food
products
order
1973,
vegetable
oil
products
control
order
1947,
edible
oils
packaging
regulation
order
1988,
solvent
extracted
oil
or
de-oiled
meal
and
edible
flour
control
order
1967,
etcetera.
8
All
these
earlier
orders
or
laws,
they
are
encompassing
the
newly
formed
food
safety
laws,
food
safety
standards
FSS,
this
FSS
and
that
is
at
the
end
it
is
also
called
I;
that
is,
food
safety
standards
of
India
right;
FSSI.
And
the
subsequently
we
will
see
that
did
not
controlling
agency
has
been
also
introduced,
that
is
called
food
safety
and
standard
authority
of
India
or
FSSAI
right.
So,
that
nowadays
has
taken
over
the
entire
food
safe
food
laws
all
this
implication
for
framing
forming,
and
I
am
implementing
everything
has
been
taken
into
by
that
difficult
this
organization
has
been
approved
and
built
by
the
parliament,
right.
So,
we
are
now
heading
towards
the
end,
because
hardly
couple
of
seconds
are
left
for
the
class.
So,
I
feel
in
the
next
class
we
will
again
little
recapitulate
and
then
go
on
the
Indian
laws,
ok.
Thank
you.
