Milk
-
How
it
looks?
So
in
the
previous
class,
we
have
said
about
how
you
can
identify
the
constituents
of
milk,
but
primarily
fat,
protein,
and
carbohydrate
right.
I
have
never
said
that
you
can
measure
like
that
you
can
identify ,
identification
and
measurement
are
altogether
different
right.
Generally
fat
in
milk
is
identified
and
also
measured
by
the
method
called
Gerber
centrifuge
method,
but
these
will
come
afterwards
as
and
when
it
appears.
So
in
this
class
again
we
are
in
the
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology ,
and
in
lecture
number
18,
we
come
to
milk
how
it
looks
like
right,
how
it
looks
like
we
have
already
said
that
this
colour
of
the
milk
which
we
have
all
said
that
this
is
blue
in
colour ,
and
maybe
white
in
colour ,
maybe
a
little
golden
yellow
in
colour ,
depending
on
the
source
depending
on
the
constituents.
Primarily ,
if
it
is
defatted
milk,
then
it
may
be
used
your
bluish
tint,
may
be
there
or
things
like
that,
but
if
it
is
high
fat
milk
then
it
could
be
your
golden
yellow
colour
also
we
said
that
if
it
is
thin
in
quantity ,
then
it
may
appear
to
be
translucent
or
transparent,
or
if
it
is
huge
in
quantity
large
in
quantity ,
then
it
becomes
opaque
right.
This
opaqueness
or
is
of
course,
because
of
the
lights
scattering
through
the
different
particles
of
the
milk
right.
Then
we
come
to
taste,
so
no
pronounced
taste
but
slightly
sweet,
there
is
no
as
such
pronounced
taste,
but
it
is
likely
sweet.
Freshly
drawn
milk
has
a
characteristic
odour ,
which
is
volatile
and
disappears
when
milk
is
exposed
to
air
right.
As
a
characteristics
milk
has
a
characteristics
odour
right,
and
the
other
day
we
had
also
said
that
how
when
we
were
saying
about
quality ,
how
odour
and
flavor
this
distinction
we
had
made
right
we
are
not
bringing
back
to
those
again.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
03:15)
So
it
disappears
when
it
is
exposed
to
air
right,
now
in
terms
of
acidity
milk
is
normally
amphoteric
in
nature.
The
amphoteric
means
what
is
amphoteric?
Amphoteric
is
that
which
gives
both
red
and
blue
litmus,
it
turns
both
red
and
blue
litmus
into
either
red
to
blue,
blue
to
red
that
it
turns
both
the
litmus
paper
right.
So
in
that
case
we
can
say
that
it
is
amphoteric,
that
it
is
having
both
acidic
as
well
as
alkaline
behavior ,
but
by
and
large
generally
milk
is
acidic
in
nature
for
many
of
the
reasons.
If
it
is
freshly
drawn
milk,
then
also
it
appears
to
be
slightly
acidic
very
rarely
you
will
get
that
it
is
amphoteric
or
alkaline
in
nature
that
is
very
very
rarely
in
typical
case
it
may
appear ,
but
by
and
large
it
is
turning
or
it
is
acidic
in
nature
right.
So
blue
to
red,
red
to
blue
both
are
possible
theoretically ,
but
again
in
all
practical
purposes
we
call
it
to
be
slightly
acidic
in
nature
right.
With
phenolphthalein
indicator
fresh
milk
shows
an
acid
reaction
if
titrated
against
standard
alkali.
Now
as
we
said
just
now
that
though
we
call
it
to
be
amphoteric,
but
in
all
practical
purposes
even
if
we
put
little;
I
understand
we
know
that
acid
base
reactions.
So
in
that
phenolphthalein
is
given
as
indicator
and
if
phenolphthalein
indicator
is
given
and
if
we
titrate
we
spied
it
to
be
acidic
in
nature
right.
So
acidity
varies
between
0.1
to
0.26
percent
in
terms
of
lactic
acid
right.
So
point
0.1
to
0.26
percent
in
terms
of
lactic
acid.
So
when
we
will
progress
in
this
topic
in
this
subject,
so
we
will
see
that
there
are
various
reasons
why
the
acidity
will
go
up
right
why
the
acidity
will
go
up
or
goes
up
why
it
becomes
more
acidic
gradually
that
we
will
come
up
afterwards,
but
generally
freshly
drawn
milk
has
acidity
to
the
tune
of
0.1
to
0.26
percent
of
acid
in
terms
of
lactic
acid.
Now
why
it
is
said
in
terms
of
lactic
acid,
why
not
in
terms
of
citric
acid,
or
any
other
acid
because
milk
contains
lactose,
that
we
have
seen
and
this
lactose
by
bacterial
decomposition
it
produces
lactic
acid
right.
Since,
it
produces
lactic
acid
so
that
is
why
the
acidity
in
milk
is
expressed
in
terms
of
lactic
acid.
So
0.1
to
0.26
percent
lactic
acid
or
in
terms
of
lactic
acid
is
normally
present
in
milk,
that
is
why
if
the
acidity
is
low
we
call
it
to
be
a
good
milk,
if
the
acidity
goes
up
maybe
that
milk
might
not
have
gone
wrong.
Wrong
why
we
are
saying,
we
are
coming
to
that
wrong
means
there
will
be
a
precipitation.
So
which
we
have
seen
we
have
said
the
other
day
for
identification
that
you
have
put
some
acid
and
something
has
come
out.
So
that
may
happen
if
the
acidity
goes
up
right.
So
that
is
why
it
is
not
desirable
that
the
acidity
of
milk
is
high
right,
normally
freshly
drawn
milk
has
low
acidity
around
0.1
up
to
0.26
it
is
said
acceptable,
beyond
that
it
may
not
be
because
then
there
are
many
other
tests
by
which
this
acidity
also
can
be
that
is
called
platform
test.
Someday
we
will
also
tell
that
right
someday
sometime
in
some
period,
we
will
also
tell
that
there
are
some
platform
test
right.
I
still
remember
like
the
other
day,
I
said
I
was
in
some
industry
there
are
lot
of
milk
used
to
come
and
the
quality
control
people
used
to
may
access
them
because
they
have
to
did
and
tell
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
right.
So
they
used
to
take
it,
consume
it
and
orally
they
used
to
test
which
is
not
a
of
course
scientific,
but
you
just
cannot
do
it
you
imagine
room
full
of
milk
containers
and
in
2-5
minutes
you
have
to
either
tell
them
yes
if
they
will
go
in
or
they
have
to
thrown
out
or
discarded.
So
that
decision
has
to
be
given,
then
which
may
not
be
possible
for
any
such
test
by
which
they
can
or
they
used
to
do
it
which
I
objected
but
however
this
is
what
is
the
reality
in
industry .
Of
course
I
am
not
saying
that
that
is
bad
part
of
the
industry ,
but
people
who
are
working
they
have
to
survive
they
have
to
also
tell
they
have
to
decide
on
work
right,
if
it
is
to
be
totally
on
scientific
basis
then
it
will
take
lot
of
time
and
the
way
things
are
coming
it
is
not
possible
to
handle
in
very
short
period.
So
they
used
to
have.
So
that
is
what
the
test
because
the
acidity
you
can
also
tell
you
can
you
our
taste
buds
can
tell
whether
onefood
is
bitter ,
or
sour,
or
sweet,
or
salty,
this
taste
buds
we
have
and
we
can
identify
very
easily
that
is
why
they
might
have
been
using
their
taste
bud
for
contouring
or
for
measuring
this.
However ,
the
acidity
of
milk
is
between
0.1
to
0.26
if
it
is
freshly
drawn,
freshly
drawn
milk
also
has
a
pH
of
around
6.5
right.
Now
another
typical
thing
which
we
will
now
say
is
which
we
have
come
across
we
come
across
everyday
because
milk
is
one
such
product
one
such
food
product
which
almost
every
house
or
all
the
houses
do
have
everyday
almost.
So
in
that
case
you
might
have
noticed
that
when
milk
is
being
heated
or
boiled
that
time
and
there
is
a
proverb
of
course,
in
many
cases
many
people
do
say
that
milk
is
a
second
wife
right,
or
second
wife
means
is
so
shy
that
turn
your
face
if
you
turn
your
face
from
milk
when
it
is
being
heated
then
it
is
said
that
it
becomes
very
much
angry
and
that
is
why
it
spills
out
and
this
is
an
experience
which
everybody
must
have
or
must
have
come
across
in
the
life.
So
this
is
because
when
you
are
heating
milk
then
what
is
happening
some
part
of
fat
some
part
of
protein
they
are
coming
up
and
forming
a
layer
on
the
surface
and
this
fine
layer
on
the
surface
does
not
allow
moisture
or
vapor
to
come
out
from
interior
of
the
milk.
The
moment
this
vapor
is
not
allowed
to
come
out
in
from
the
interior
to
the
outside
ambient
then
what
is
happening
that
barrier
is
coming
up
and
if
you
don’t
take
care,
then
it
spills
out
right,
that
is
why
milk
gets
spilled
out
during
boiling
and
that
is
why
you
have
to
take
lot
of
care
while
you
are
boiling
milk
and
that
is
why
that
proverb
is
said
right.
So
this
you
have
to
also
keep
in
mind
that
when
milk
is
being
heated
that
crust
is
formed
and
this
crust
is
made
of
fat
and
protein
which
comes
out
from
the
milk
during
boiling
right.
So
that’s
what
we
are
saying
here
a
tough
film
is
formed
and
that
is
on
the
surface
of
the
milk
container
and
that
comes
out
that
prevents
moisture
to
come
out
or
vapor
to
come
out
and
its
spills
away
right.
So
on
prolonged
heating
boiling
brown
shade
colour
is
there
and
a
change
in
taste
is
also
there.
You
might
have
seen
at
home
mummy
and
many
seniors,
they
are
making
different
milk
products,
different
dishes
for
with
milk,
maybe
I
do
not
know
whether
what
you
call
payasam
or
kheer
or
things
like
that
and
for
that
they
are
boiling
milk
for
a
long
time
without
adding
anything.
And
you
might
have
observed
that
when
you
are
heating
or
to
start
with
the
boiling
the
milk
they
might
have
started
with
white
milk,
but
when
it
is
getting
concentrated
then
gradually
the
colour
is
getting
changed
from
this
white
to
say
maybe
some
brownish
or
some
yellowishdeep
brownish
colour
in;
that
is
because
of
course,
there
is
because
with
that
we
must
know
that
this
chemistry
also,
that
when
you
are
heating
milk
contains
what
milk
contains
you
have
seen
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate.
Carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
lactose
right
and
this
is
of
course,
a
part
of
chemistry
that
lactose
is
a
sugar
and
when
you
are
heating
sugar
then
there
is
if
it
is
directly
being
heated
then
there
is
a
reaction
goes
on
and
that
is
called
caramelization.
This
caramelization
produces
that
red
colour
or
brown
colour
not
red
browns
colour
and
this
brown
colour
is
one
of
the
reason
is
caramelization
and
another
vital
reason
particularly
in
milk
is
that
this
sugar
milk
also
contains
lot
of
protein
that
we
have
identified.
So
this
protein
and
the
sugar
they
will
react
and
they
form
caramelized
product
as
well,
the
maillard
product
or
maillard
reaction
happens
that
is
called
when
sugar
and
amine
they
are
together ,
being
heated
then
they
form
this
reaction
that
is
the
caramelization
and
in
the
maillard
reaction
and
both
forms
melanoidins
which
are
brownish
in
color .
This
is
a
chemistry
of
course,
this
is
true
for
any
whether
it
is
in
milk
or
any
other
this
is
true
that
when
sugar
is
being
heated
and
that
is
why
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
observed
or
not
a
mummy
and
other
who
are
making
dishes
for
you
so
during
preparation,
they
do
add
a
little
bit
of
sugar ,
it
is
not
for
sweetening
you
it
is
not
maybe
sometimes
for
some
people
may
be
for
sweetening,
but
primarily
not
for
sweetening,
primarily
that
this
sugar
when
it
is
being
heated.
Then
it
forms
caramelized,
it
under
goes
caramelization
and
that
caramelization
produces
some
color
as
well
as
some
flavor .
So
which
are
adding
to
the
dish
right
that
is
what,
so
and
also
in
many
other
cases
where
you
have
both
sugar
and
means
nitrogen
in
the
form
of
amine
right
nitrogen
in
the
form
of
amine,
then
this
sugar
amine
reaction
that
is
called
maillard
reaction
that
happens
and
that
causes
both
color
and
flavor
in
the
material
food
right,
in
milk
it
also
happens
right.
So
its
results
in
brown
shade
of
color
and
the
change
in
taste.Now ,
on
acidification
we
have
said
in
the
previous
class
acidification,
we
had
done
by
in
the
milk
we
had
put
some
acid,
and
we
have
seen
some
precipitation
has
come
up.
So
that
is
what
it
also
happens
here
that
this
acidification
results
in
precipitation
of
soft,
white,
jelly
like
mass
and
this
is
known
as
curd
with
separation
of
nearly
clear
fluid,
or
whey
right.
So
the
other
day
other
class
we
said
that
how
to
identify
the
protein
and
fat
and
other
parts
of
the
milk
constituents.
There
we
add
that
is
acidified
we
saw
that
some
white
thing
has
come
out
and
there
of
course,
fat
was
separately
taken
up
but
here
we
have
not
taken
up
fat
separately .
So
if
you
acidify
then
it
produces
mass
soft
white
jelly
like
mass
and
this
is
known
as
the
curd
which
separates
out
from
the
whey ,
remaining
part
is
called
the
whey
and
this
is
in
principle
we
call
it
to
be
chhena
right
in
principle,
you
recall
it
to
be
chhena
at
home,
you
might
have
seen
mummy
and
others
they
are
making
chhena
by
putting
some
acid
that
could
be
citric
acid
or
some
salt
or
maybe
some
nimbu
pani
that
is
also
the
citric
acid.
So
all
these
are
added
such
that,
the
separation
or
sedimentation
of
the
curd
takes
place
and
this
is
known
as
chhena
right,
which
we
will
also
come
afterwards.
If
a
portion
of
fresh
milk
is
allowed
to
stand
undisturbed,
then
a
layer
forms
on
the
surface
known
as
cream
due
to
the
gathering
of
the
fat
globules,
which
can
be
examined
under
compound
microscope
wherein,
immense
numbers
of
glistening,
spherical
bodies
of
varying
sizes
will
be
seen.
This
I
just
said
the
other
day
in
other
class
that
if
you
look
under
microscope
then
you
see
that
fat
globules
are
dancing
right,
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
that
fat
globules
are
dancing.
So
if
you
just
keep
for
sometime
milk
undisturbed
then
you
will
see
something
has
come
out,
and
this
thing
which
has
come
out
is
known
as
the
fat,
fat
gets
separated.
Why
and
how
we
will
come
afterwards,
but
still
we
tell
that
from
the
Stoke’ s
law,
you
can
tell
that
for
a
given
time
how
much
quantity
of
fat
will
come
out
just
like
that
if
you
keep
it
like
that
right
from
the
Stoke’ s
law,
there
you
have
to
know
certain
parameters
like
density ,
viscosity
etcetera,
those
things
have
to
be
known
diameter
of
the
fat
globules
these
things
have
to
be
known,
but
you
can
predict
right.
And
this
is
because
when
you
are
keeping
the
milk
just
like
that
for
sometime
right.
A
layer
forms
on
the
surface
known
as
cream
due
to
the
gathering
of
the
fat
globules.
Again,
I
will
tell
you
one
more
thing
that
you
might
have
come
across
with
your
age
that
by
chance
by
accident
of
course,
you
do
not
do
it
purposefully
by
accident
if
thermometer
gets
broken
and
thermometers
are
normally
made
up
mercury
glass
thermometer
right.
So
that
mercury
bulb
if
it
gets
broken
then
mercury
drops
and
the
moment
that
mercury
drops
lot
of
globules
of
mercury
they
are
formed
and
of
course,
mercury
is
bad
mercury
is
very
poisonous.
So
if
it
comes
in
contact
with
any
cut
surface
that
is
very
very
bad
right
and
if
you
gather
those
mercury
globules
and
if
you
see
that
1
mercury
globule
is
here
right
1
mercury
globule
is
here
and
another
mercury
globule.
So
1
mercury
globule
is
here
and
another
mercury
globule
is
nearby .
So
these
2
attract
each
other
and
they
become
a
bigger
one
right
this
is
called
coalescence
right
similar
thing
happens
in
fat
globules
also.
When
fat
globules
are
nearby
then
what
they
do
they
do
coalescence
and
form
a
bigger
molecule
right.
As
I
just
said
the
Stoke’ s
law
where
you
will
see
that
separation
of
this
fat
globule
is
a
function
of
diameter ,
and
that
to
a
square
of
the
diameter
right.
So
that
means,
if
the
bigger
the
diameter
is
the
more
the
coalescence
is
there
the
more
this
fat
globules
agglomerate
the
bigger
is
the
size
more
will
be
the
separation
that’s
what
it
happens
when
you
are
keeping
milk
just
like
that
undisturbed
right.
Now
if
the
fresh
milk
is
allowed
to
remain
at
ordinary
temperature
for
15
to
21
centigrade
for
24
hours
or
longer
right.
It
will
have
a
pronounced
acid
taste
again
here
it
comes
here
we
have
given
a
small
temperature
and
time
given
about
24
hour,
15-20
degree
centigrade
is
very
small.
In
our
country
normal
temperature
in
summer
roughly
somewhere
around
35
40
or
even
more
right.
So
one
day
you
brought
the
milk
from
milk
man
or
some
supplier
as
given
and
you
came
to
the
class
forgot
to
take
care
of
the
milk
and
the
whole
day,
you
were
very
much
busy
and
the
temperature
is
very
hot
summer
say
40-45
degree.
So
in
the
evening
you
went
back
and
you
wanted
to
have
the
milk
you
wanted
to
boil.
The
moment
you
started
that
you
saw
that
milk
has
gone
wrong.
This
is
an
another
thing
which
is
associated
with
milk
very
very
frequently .
Typically
for
the
people
like
our
like
we
are
in
our
country
rather
where
the
summer
is
a
very
very
high
temperature
summer .
So
that
it
happens
that
it
gets
curdled
this
is
we
call
it
to
be
curdling
right
milk
got
curdled
and
in
most
of
the
cases
apart
from
few
cases
which
is
not
I
don’t
know
whether
that
is
justifiable
or
not
it
should
not
be
from
the
point
of
view
science,
it
should
not
be,
but
some
people
do
consume
even
then,
but
they
should
not
be
because
you
don’t
know
when
the
accident
will
happen.
What
happens
in
it
when
it
is
getting
you
have
taken
the
milk
you
have
put
it
in
the
not
refrigerated
just
like
that
in
outside
ambient
where
the
temperature
is
very
high
around
45;
40-45
degree
centigrade.
And
you
got
around
4-5
or
7-8
hours.
So
in
that
what
we
have
seen
that
it
got
curdled
and
if
this
curdled
milk
is
taken
I
am
not
saying
there
will
be
accident,
but
there
is
a
probability .
So
why
to
take
the
chance
because
you
do
not
know
mummy
has
made
curdling
by
giving
known
thing
that
is
citric
acid
or
nimbu
pani
or
some
salt.
So
that
curdling
was
chhena
is
known
you
have
done
it,
but
here
you
don’t
know
you
have
not
given
anything
it
was
in
the
air
for
couple
of
hours
or
may
be
8
to
10
hours
and
after
that
you
have
boiled
it.So
you
have
boiled
it;
that
means,
whatever
was
there
by
the
term
of
pasteurization
or
sterilization
everything
you
have
killed
all
the
organisms.
So
you
can
consume
it
that
is
what
many
people
do
some
people
not
many
some
people
will
do,
but
you
never
know
that
where
to
where
the
products
during
curdling
being
formed
because
these
curdling
was
primarily
by
the
organisms,
which
were
invaded
into
the
milk
from
the
surrounding
and
this
surrounding
may
contain
lactobacillus
or
many
other
because
milk
is
a
very
good
source
for
organisms
to
survive
or
grow
because
it
has
all
moisture,
fat,
protein,
carbohydrate
everything.
So
very
easy
lot
of
food
is
there
for
the
microbes
to
grow ,
so
they
invaded
into
it,
multiplied
into
it,
and
then
produce
lot
of
acid
and
that
acid
curdled.
Now
dealing
this
production
of
the
acid
whether
some
other
unwanted
materials
were
also
formed
or
not,
is
not
known,
so
that
is
why
it
is
never
advisable
that
if
a
milk
is
curdled
just
like
that
then
you
consume
it
because
you
don’t
know
what
the
other
materials
are
also
formed
other
than
acid.
Acid
could
be
one,
but
many
others
may
also
might
have
also
formed
that
is
not
desirable
may
be
some
aldehydes,
ketones,
which
are
not
desirable
and
you
have
no
control
over
there.
So
that
was
done
just
like
that
by
the
nature,
in
this
case
nature
is
negative
acting
as
negative.
Because
invention
of
the
organisms
which
were
not
controlled
by
you.
So
you
don’t
know
normally
as
we
said
earlier
that
lactic
acid
producing
organisms
or
normally
called
lactic
acid
bacteria.
So
they
do
transform
lactose
into
lactic
acid,
but
here
you
have
not
and
that
is
if
you
give
lactic
acid
culture
then
it
will
be
done.
What
mummy
does
in
many
cases
you
might
have
seen
that
in
some
cases
that
whey
which
is
left
over
is
also
used
for
the
acidification
or
for
the
separation
of
this
curd
in
many
cases
it
is
done,
that
is
because
that
might
have
some
bacteria
which
is
known
that
is
lactic
acid
bacteria
that
will
produce.
But
when
it
was
done
by
keeping
it
for
such
a
long
time
at
high
temperature,
we
do
not
know
which
are
the
organisms
invaded.
So
it
might
not
have
only
produced
lactic
acid,
it
might
have
produced
many
other
undesirable,
and
which
may
be
bad
or
which
may
be
what
we
call
poisonous,
or
which
may
be
bad
to
consume
or
harmful
to
consume
so
that
is
not
desirable.
So
what
we
learned
that
anything
curdling
just
like
that
from
milk
is
not
supposed
to
be
consumed
by
the
people
right.
Only
when
you
have
curdled
it
by
giving
your
own
known
quantity
known
things
then
only
you
can
consume
it
right,
but
never
consume
any
such
curdled
milk
if
it
is
done
by
nature
keeping
it
just
like
that
for
many
hours
right
ok.
So
the
time
is
over.Thank
you.
