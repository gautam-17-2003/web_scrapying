Milk
Pasteurization
and
Homogenization
In
our
forty
fourth
class
of
this
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology;
we
were
discussing
about
the
milk
processing,
right.
In
earlier
classes
we
were
discussing
about
milk
processing
and
we
came
up
to
milk
pasteurization.
Of
course,
pasteurization
is
one
such
a
process
in
milk
liquid
milk
not
only
in
liquid
milk
in
many
liquid
foods
that
serves
the
major
purpose
we
said
that
reasoning,
but
will
again
come
in
detail
a
little
more
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:06)
So,
we
were
in
the
UHT ,
right.
So,
some
disadvantages
associated
with
high
temperature
are
like
this
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
alteration
of
milk
proteins
and
this
can
affect
the
properties
of
such
milk
when
used
to
make
other
food
products.
And
in
that
the
major
one
which
comes
in
is
the
Maillard
reaction.
And
you
remember
that
we
had
said
in
earlier
classes
that
as
and
when
the
new
things
will
come
will
try
to
define
them
or
extend
them
as
much
as
possible
because
that
becomes
as
generalised
not
only
in
liquid
milk
or
liquid
food,
but
also
in
solid
food,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
that
this
elevated
temperature
causes
the
Maillard
reaction
and
then
it
comes
what
is
that;
what
is
the
Maillard
reaction.
1
(Refer
Slide
Time:
02:25)
We
have
said
that
are
two
types
of
or
three
types
of
in
general
two
types
at
one
is
enzymatic
and
another
is
non
enzymatic,
right.
So,
that
browning
we
divide
them
into
two
types
this
is
true
for
all
foods
whether
solid
or
liquid
does
not
matter ,
it
is
associated
with
all
foods.
So,
these
two
types
of
browning
reactions
that
could
be
in
fruits
and
vegetables
that
could
be
in
milk
that
could
be
in
any
solid
or
liquid
food
material,
right.
So,
enzymatic
and
non
enzymatic
these
two
types
of
browning
they
are
associated
with
this.
So,
here
we
have
written
fruits
and
vegetables
and
here
I
write
and
liquid
foods,
right.
So,
fruits
and
vegetables
liquid
foods,
so
and
this
is
under
solid
food
right
and
that
is
under
liquid
food.
So,
under
for
them
the
browning
reaction
takes
place
in
enzymatic
manner
or
in
non
enzymatic
manner .
So,
if
it
is
enzymatic
manner
then
this
is
controlled
by
the
enzymes,
right.
We
give
the
example
earlier
that
if
we
are
making
say,
if
you
are
cutting
apple,
or
if
you
are
cutting
potato
very
handy
examples
because
every
now
and
then
you
come
across
potato
you
come
across
everyday;
apple
may
or
may
not
be
you
are
coming
across
everyday ,
but
so,
if
you
cut
it
even
those
I
said
that
if
you
when
people
are
making
prashads
right
or
offering
to
the
gods
then
those
prashads
they
also
become
black
brown
different
colours
depending
on
what
are
the
fruits
you
are
supplying
banana
were
such
it
becomes
black
then
apple
potato
these
things
we
come
across
very
often.
2
So,
that
comes
under
the
browning
and
the
other
one
which
you
if
you
remember
I
give
the
example
of
mummy
and
seniors
you
and
mummy
or
others
they
are
preparing
for
you,
for
god
or
whatever
payasam
things
like
that
or
kheer
that
time
in
boiling
milk
for
longer
period
and
when
started
it
was
it
was
white
milk,
but
after
long
time
it
became
brown.
Though
nothing
has
been
given
nothing
to
that
milk
has
been
given
not
even
the
sweetening
not
even
any
other .
So,
that
happens
under
non
enzymatic
browning,
right.
And,
in
non
enzymatic
browning
there
are
again
two
types
one
is
called
caramelization
and
another
is
called
Maillard
reaction.
So,
this
caramelization
and
Maillard
reaction
that
is
associated
with
the
food
materials
and
everywhere
that
Q
10
if
you
remember
we
had
said
this
Q
10
that
is
always
associated,
right.
So,
Q
10
means
the
more
the
temperature
the
higher
is
the
rate
of
reaction.
So,
this
is
true
for
every
material.
The
higher
the
temperature,
the
higher
the
rates
of
reactions
that
is
any
type.
So,
when
you
when
kheer
or
payasam
was
being
prepared
that
was
at
higher
temperature.
So,
that
rates
of
reactions
that
is
Maillard
reaction
that
was
high
caramelization
that
was
high
that
that
is
why
the
browning
took
place.
So,
non
enzymatic
again
we
divide
them
into
two;
one
is
caramelization
when
where
the
colour
would
depend
is.
So,
caramelization
right
and
another
one
is
Maillard
I
am
sorry
that
the
writing
of
with
the
pen
hopefully
it
is
understandable
right.
So,
this
these
to
we
divide
them
into
one
with
caramelization
and
another
is
with
the
with
the
Maillard.
This
non-enzymatic
so,
whatever
is
with
enzymatic
it
goes
there
not
non-enzymatic
it
should
have
been
there
it
should
have
been
up
to
that,
right.
So,
let
us
take
this
arrow
up
to
that
so,
it
is
non
enzymatic
no
enzymatic.
So,
if
it
is
enzymatic
browning
oxidation
of
phenolic
compounds
that
happens,
right.
So,
for
which
the
sensory
properties
like
color ,
flavor
they
got
changed.
So,
out
of
which
many
could
be
bad,
some
could
be
good.
When
you
made
payasam
or
kheer
that
color
was
desirable,
right
so,
because
that
was
different
from
the
milk.
So,
that
was
desirable.
So,
and
it
also
produced
some
flavor
not
only
color ,
but
also
some
flavour
produced.
So,
this
flavour
and
color
was
welcomed
in
that
process,
but
in
many
processes
they
are
not,
right.
So,
depending
on
what
you
intend
what
is
your
end
use
some
could
be
good,
some
could
be
bad,
right.
So,
bad
and
good
depends
on
your
application
your
use,
right.

Time:

So,
if
you
look
at
then
the
enzymatic
browning
if
you
look
at
the
enzymatic
browning
then
we
look
that
this
enzymatic
browning
is
done
by
polyphenoloxidase,
right.
So,
let
the
entire
thing
come
in
before
you
and
I
think
some
more
will
come
this.
So,
PPO
or
that
is
called
polyphenoloxidase.
There
are
many
enzymes
which
are
which
are
associated
with
enzymatic
browning
one
such
is
polyphenoloxidase,
right.
We
cannot
give
all
the
examples
because
time
is
the
primary
thing,
right?
We
have
to
finish
up
the
course
within
the
stipulated
time.
So,
we
cannot
give
all
the
examples,
but
polyphenoloxidase
is
one
enzyme
which
commonly
used
as
you
see
apples,
avocados,
lettuce,
potatoes
etcetera
right.
So,
there
it
is
applicable.
So,
many
other
enzymes
are
also
there
which
are
associated
with
this
right
and
when
many
many .
So,
those
are
for
browning
of
that
particular
food
product,
right.
So,
what
happens
in
that
enzymatic
browning?
I
could
not
show
you
because
of
the
time
constraint
that
this
enzymatic
browning
that
happens
this
oxidation
under
free
radical
mechanism
that
is
one,
right.
Free
radical
mechanism
that
you
have
R-R
if
you
have
then
that
comes
a
free
radical
R
plus
R
may
be
right.
So,
these
free
radical
when
it
is
generated
that
free
radical
comes
under
reaction
and
produces
different
in
products.
One
here
we
are
give
example
that
the
reaction
which
is
associated
is
a
4
methyl-catechol
this
is
the
one
of
the
substrate.
So,
in
presence
of
oxygen
and
the
enzyme
in
and
there
could
be
some
catalyst
like
say
copper
or
something
which
also
may
act
as
the
catalyst.
So,
that
reacts
with
oxygen
forming
an
intermediate
compound
called
quinones,
right.4
This
is
the
structure
of
the
quinones
this
is
ortho
quin
can
that
can
be
para
quinone
if
there
right
or
if
this
is
also
with
double
one
here
with
that
could
be
and
ortho
para
this
is
ortho
meta
and
para
this
is
para
quinone,
this
is
right.
So,
there
in
all
the
cases
this
quinone
derivatives
they
are
formed
and
with
one
molecule
of
water
it
makes
an
oxygen,
right.
If
it
is
this
is
one
now
it
is
the
generalized
equation
that
leads
to
these
melanins
or
if
it
is
not
this
part,
this
part
amines
and
oxygen
that
could
form
or
may
be
nonenzymatic
condensation
that
may
happen
and
may
produce
melanins.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:50)
This
is
with
respect
to
the
with
respect
to
the
enzymes,
right
with
respect
to
enzymes
which
may
produce
soluble
or
insoluble
brown
polymers
they
are
called
melanins
or
melanoidins,
right.
It
is
clear
melanins
or
melanoidins
melanoidins
right.
So,
this
melanoidins
soluble
and
insoluble
brown
material
that
are
those
are
melanoidins,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
the
other
one
this
is
the
enzymatic
one
and
there
I
said
in
many
cases
this
mechanism
follows
this
mechanism
follows
your
free
radical
mechanism,
right.
5
(Refer
Slide
Time:
15:59)
That
the
other
one,
that
Maillard
react
which
takes
place
Maillard
reaction
is
non-enzymatic,
right.
So,
if
this
happens
with
caramel
or
caramelisation
caramelisation
is
basically
when
you
are
eating
sugar
when
you
are
eating
sugar
that
times
caramelisation
is
taking
place
that
crust
on
the
on
the
bread
there
it
is
caramelised,
right.
That
brown
color
on
the
bread
that
is
caramelisation.
So,
similar
to
that
many
are
there
you
have
seen
that
mummy
and
grand
mummy’ s
are
putting
some
sugar
in
your
daily
food
preparation
that
is
not
for
making
it
sweet,
but
the
kind
of
caramelisation
happen
and
that
improves
flavor
as
well
as
the
color .
So,
that
is
why
that
is
given
because
not
sufficient
quantity
of
sugar
is
given
so
that
it
becomes
sweet
not
for
sweetening,
but
for
introducing
some
flavor
or
inducting
some
flavor
as
well
some
color
to
caramelisation,
but
the
reaction
is
very
very
complex
and
that
also
produces
melanoidins
and
melanoids,
right.
So,
if
you
look
at
this
Maillard
reaction
sorry
if
you
look
at
this
Maillard
reaction
then
we
see
that
this
is
what
Maillard
reaction
I
had
written
in
vertical
form,
right.
So,
Maillard
reaction
that
this
is
the
general
schema
this
was
in
developed
in
50s,
early
50s
right.
So,
this
is
the
one
source
has
been
taken
that
aldose
right
this
is
aldose
means
aldehyde
which
are
in
the
sugar
form,
right
and
amino
group
so
right.
So,
when
they
are
reacting
eliminating
water
and
producing
N-substituted
glycosylamine,
right
this
is
the
one
of
the
beginning
of
the
reaction.
Then
you
see
not
many
parts
it
is
under going
the
paths
this
path
coming
to
some
intermediate
likes
right
1-amino
1-deoxy
2-ketose
or
it
may
be
producing
like
fission6
products
that
could
be
acetol
or
butane
di
butanedione
or
2
oxoproponal,
etcetera,
right
that
may
also
come
from
here
right.
This
may
lead
to
shift
base
of
HMF
or
furfural,
right
or
there
it
may
go
to
HMF
or
furfural
some
sugars
may
also
add
here
or
from
here
it
may
leave
water .
So,
it
was
leaving
water
and
reduction
reaction
may
take
place,
right
which
may
produce,
dehydro-reductones
that
could
be
that
could
be
again
another
intermediate
or
from
here
again
some
more
intermediate
could
be
depending
on
different
path
like
strecker
degradation
like.
So,
that
produces
aldehydes,
right
that
there
are
many
intermediate
paths
like
strecker
degradation
is
one
and
ketoenol
mechanism
that
could
be
another .
So,
many
such
reactions
do
happen.
So,
intermediate
and
aldehydes
or
aldols
and
N-free
that
is
nitrogen
free
polymers
that
also
could
be
or
ultimately
it
comes
to
melanoidins
or
brown
nitrogenous
polymers
and
copolymers
that
may
form
it,
right.
So,
you
see
in
many
parts
it
is
coming
this
is
also
very
not
so
complicated
structure.
There
are
many
cases
in
many
many
books
also
it
is
available
that
this
scheme
is
even
more
complicated
and
they
are
introduced
intermediate
path
ways
intermediate
process
intermediate
products
which
are
developed
now
it
depends
on
the
extent
of
the
reaction
where
it
is
getting
ended
that
is
why
is
it
is
very
difficult
in
Maillard
reaction
to
predict
what
will
be
the
end
product,
right
what
will
be
the
end
product
it
can
stop
here
it
can
stop
here,
or
some
all
of
them
might
have
been
produced.
So,
some
of
them
or
all
of
them
might
have.
So,
that
is
that
is
the
beauty
of
this
reaction;
this
Maillard
reaction
caramelisation
that
may
happen,
right.
So,
preconditioning
and
participating
compounds
and
the
complexity
are
like
this
glucose-glycine
more
than
24
products
could
be
found,
xylose-glycine
more
than
50
products
also
could
be
found
like
that.
So,
depending
on
how
far
you
are
extending
how
far
you
are
your
reaction
is
happening,
how
long
it
is
happening
all
these
will
dictate
what
could
be
the
end
product,
right.
So,
it
is
very
difficult
to
pinpoint
that
through
that
Maillard
reaction
you
got
this
as
the
end
product
that
is
why
you
will
always
see
that
in
general
this
food
scientists
and
technologists
they
do
say
that
sugar
having
reaction
produces
melanoidins
or
melanoids
or
melanins
whatever
be
the
naming
right
they
are
all
synonym
and
it
follows
different-dif ferent
pathways,
right.
and
in
caramelization
also
you
will
have
the
same
you
will
have
the
same
in
caramelization,
right.7(Refer
Slide
Time:

Now ,
let
us
look
into
some
other
aspects
also
that
when
we
are
applying
high
temperature
pasteurisation
then
you
can
heat
milk
to
60°C
for
not
less
than
30
minutes
that
is
called
low
temperature
long
time
pasteurisation
and
alternatively
you
can
heat
you
alternatively
you
can
heat
upto
70°C
for
not
less
than
16
seconds
right,
that
is
high
temperature
short
time
or
HTST
pasteurisation
or
equivalent.
So,
this
time
temperature
combinations
have
become
proven
to
be
sufficient
for
the
destruction
of
the
pathogens
and
the
enzyme
phosphatase
we
have
said
that
this
phosphatase
enzyme
is
one
of
the
most
heat
resistant
enzyme.
So,
that
can
be
destroyed
by
this
and
a
negative
test
result
for
the
alkaline
phosphatase
test
confirms
the
efficiency
of
the
pasteurisation,
right.

So,
let
us
proceed
now
quick
because
our
total
time
is
fixed
frozen
dairy
dessert
mix
pasteurisation
when
we
are
doing
dairy
dessert
we
will
come
subsequently
in
the
other
class
that
when
you
are
making
ice
cream
that
is
a
dairy
dessert.
So,
that
time
you
have
to
pasteurise
a
lot
of
ingredients
to
get
the
ice
cream
mixed.
So,
there
of
course,
this
pasteurisation
will
the
time
temperature
combination
will
be
different,
right.
So,
very
many
frozen
dairy
products
exists
in
the
market
when
pasteurisation
of
ice
cream
or
ice
cream
milk
heat
the
product
to
at
least
69°C
for
not
less
than
30°C
or
80°C
for
not
less
than
25
seconds
any
other
time
temperature
combination
must
be
approved.
For
example,
83°C
per
16
seconds
etcetera,
but
that
combination
time
temperature
you
have
to
generate
right
you
have
to
generate
and
see
at
the
end
to
any
through
any
enzyme
which
is
a
highly
heat
resistant
that
if
the
inactivation
is
over
then
you
can
conclude
that
your
this
thing
is
over
pasteurisation
is
over
ok.
Pasteurisation
of
enriched
milk
products
like
milk
based
products
with
10%
butterfat
or
higher
or
added
sugar
for
example,
cream,
chocolate
milk
etcetera
should
be
heated
to
63-66°C
for
30
minutes
or
75°C
for
effective
pasteurization.

Now ,
let
us
quickly
go
through
this
there
are
objective
your
pasteurisation,
we
have
already
said
many
many
times
so,
I
will
just
read
out.
The
chief
objective
of
milk
pasteurisation
is
to
destroy
pathogenic
bacteria
that
could
have
a
public
health
concern
by
destroying
these
organisms
the
product
become
safe
and
public
for
public
consumption.
Secondly ,
pasteurisation
eliminates
destructive
bacteria
and
enzymes
that
could
cause
spoilage
of
the
product.
This
leads
to
a
prolonged
shelf
life
of
the
milk
pasteurised
milk
is
commercially
commercially
sterile
which
means
that
they
are
not
entirely
entirely
rid
of
bacteria;
that
means,
you
are
not
totally
making
bacteria
free.
One
should
compound
their
preservation
with
another
method,
usually
refrigeration.
In
modern
milk
first
the
processing
plants
the
plant
heat
exchanger
is
connected
to
a
separator
and
homogeneizer
in
the
same
line
the
milk
separates
separators
help
in
butter
fat
standardisation
while
the
homogeneizer
breaks
down
fat
globules
into
tiny
microglobules
that
remain
suspended
throughout
the
milk.
It
prevents
formation
of
cream
layer
when
the
milk
is
left
and
standing
for
a
long.
This
we
have
said
many
many
times
so
that
is
why
I
just
went
through
rapidly .
10
(Refer
Slide
Time:
30:01)
Some
steps
which
we
have
to
go
through
during
pasteurisation,
but
hopefully
now
the
time
is
over
for
this
class
we
will
carry
over
to
the
next
class,
ok.
Thank
