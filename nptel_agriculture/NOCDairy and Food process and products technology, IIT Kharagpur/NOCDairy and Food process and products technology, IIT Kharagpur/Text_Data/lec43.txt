Pasteurization
Effectiveness
So,
we
are
seen
in
pasteurization
or
low
temperature
low
time
also
high
temperature,
high
temp
perhaps
high
temperature
high
time
we
will
discuss
a
little
more.
So,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Product
Technology
course
we
are
in
lecture
number
43.
We
also
will
try
to
cover
up
the
effectiveness
of
pasteurization
that
you
have
pasteurized
how
much
it
is
effective
right.
So,
that
should
also
be
known.
So,
is
that
pasteurization
is
correct
or
not.
So,
how
to
know
that
so,
there
is
some
process;
some
techniques
by
which
you
can
know
that
how
the
pasteurization
was
effective
or
not
how
whatever
you
have
done
is
good
or
not
that
should
be
known.
So,
we
will
do
today
that
also
along
with
maybe
some
high
temperatures,or
high
temperatures
short
time
pasteurization
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:23)
So,
how
to
test
for
the
effectiveness
of
the
milk
pasteurization
so,
high
temperature
pasteurization
denatures
peroxidase;
so,
peroxidase
is
an
enzyme
right.
So,
this
is
highly
heat
resistant
enzyme
peroxidase.
So,
if
the
enzyme
preroxidase
is
inactivated
then
we
can
call
that
the
pasteurization
is
effective
right
this
is
one
there
may
be
some
other
technique
also.1
So,
peroxidase
test
is
one
of
them
where
if
it
is
denatured
or
if
it
is
destroyed
then
it
can
be
said
that
pasteurizations
is
ok.
The
enzyme
is
more
resistant
to
heat
treatment
then
all
pathogenic
organisms
or
microor ganisms
found
in
milk
and
if
the
heat
treatment
is
sufficient
to
denature
the
enzyme,
then
it
is
a
confirmation
that
all
the
pathogenic
organisms
are
also
destroyed
or
killed
right
in
by
this
process.
So,
properly
pasteurized
milk
should
give
a
negative
peroxidase
test,
peroxidase
test
if
you
perform
so,
that
should
give
you
a
negative
test
right.
Now ,
another
way
is
that
another
way
is
that
alkaline
phosphatase
test
that
may
not
be
very
reliable
because
research
has
shown
that
it
can
be
reactivated,
especially
in
pasteurized
milk
as
high
fat
content
right.
So,
as
I
said
now
there
are
many
techniques
by
which
you
can
know
you
can
judge
pasteurization
was
effective
or
not.
So,
in
early
days
earlier
times
that
alkaline
phosphatase
used
to
be
taken
as
one
of
the
target
test
or
one
of
the
tests
by
which
the
effectiveness
pasteurizations
can
be
judged.
If
alkaline
phosphatase
used
to
give
you
negative
result;
that
means,
pasteurizations
is
effective.
But
after
our
subsequently
research
on
these
apps
that
studies
on
this
have
you
reviled
that
the
alkaline
phosphatase
is
not
good
enough
because
it
may
regenerate
reactivate
some
of
the
organisms
which
might
not
have
been
killed,
but
phosphatase
might
have
seen
to
be
negative.
So,
that
pasteurization
reactivates
that
phosphatase
test.
So,
that
is
because
high
fat
content
in
the
milk
may
reactivate
that
the
some
of
the
phosphatase
and
it
may
not
be
again
negative.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
not
dependable.
Whereas,
peroxidase
test
if
it
is
negative
then
confirmly
it
may
you
can
say
that
you
are
a
you
are
pasteurization
process
that
is
heat
killing
or
heat
method
heating
method
that
was
absolutely
and
you
can
depend
on
this
result
right.
2(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:27)
We
may
again
come
back
to
HTST
because
some
more
things
are
to
be
said
about
HTST
that
is
a
high
temperature
short
time.
So,
this
type
of
pasteurization
is
also
known
as
the
flash
pasteurization
because
time
requirement
is
very
low.
Flash
pasteurization
involves
heating
milk
to
71.7°C
for
15
seconds
to
kill
the
target
organisms
that
is
your
Coxiella
burnetii
,
that
can
be
killed
at
71.7°C
for
15
seconds
which
is
the
most
resistant
pathogen
in
the
milk,
in
raw
milk
this
is
the
most
resistant
pathogen.
Since,
it
is
technically
impossible
to
bring
the
milk
to
that
exact
temperature
normally
it
is
always
safe
to
work
with
range
of
temperatures
right.
To
be
safe
we
can
do
it
that
milk
heating
between
72
to
74°C
for
15
to
20
seconds,
this
is
for
all
precautionary
purpose
that
coming
exactly
on
71.7°C
maintaining
it
for
15
seconds
may
not
be
all
the
time
technically
feasible.
So,
for
from
the
technicality
or
from
the
technical
point
of
view
you
increase
the
temperature
a
little
may
by
some
decimal
like
71.7
to
72.3
degree
is
nothing
or
72
to
74
within
that
temperature
if
you
can
hold
it
for
15
to
20
second.
Then
you
are
safe
that
your
pasteurizations
that
is
high
temperatures
short
derived
pasteurizations
is
over
and
you
can
be
very
much
safe,
that
it
will
not
cause
any
infection
to
the
consumer .
This
will
ensure
that
the
milk
is
heated
uniformly
to
the
required
temperature
and
this
method
is
most
suitable
in
continuous
pasteurizations
systems
because
we
said
the
error
batch
pasteurizations,
batch
pasteurizations
normally
called
LTLT
that
is
low
temperature
long
time.
But
high
temperature
short
time
that3
can
be
you
batch
or
that
can
also
be
continuous
because
your
time
duration
is
very
small
15-20
seconds.
So,
that
is
the
holding
period.
So,
if
your
heat
exchanger
is
this
inlet
fluid
is
coming
from
here,
exit
is
going
from
there
within
this
it
is
staying
within
15
to
20
seconds
that
is
their
whole
exchanger
is
at
72-74°C
and
your
allowing
it
to
inlet
to
exit
15-20
seconds.
And
that
is
good
enough
for
killing
all
organism
because
you
have
killed
with
that
target
organism
Coxiella
burnetii
right.
So,
Coxiella
burnetii
is
the
most
resistant
pathogen
if
there
is
kill
all
the
organisms
are
killed
pathogen
organisms
of
course,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:12)
Then
flash
pasteurizations
are
pasteurized
milk
will
keep
will
keep
for
between
16
and
21
days.
For
commercial
reasons,
some
manufacturers
intentionally
reduce
the
number
of
days
to
push
the
products
out
of
the
shelves,
because
if
it
is
lasting
for
20-20
days
right
then
the
sell
may
be
depleted.
So,
to
avoid
that
the
manufacturers
might
make
it
purposefully
that
know
you
to
till
not
last
for
20
days.
So,
5-7
days
by
which
if
we
have
to
consume
otherwise
it
is
not
safe
so
that
the
demand
remains
in
the
market.
So,
that
is
business
tactics
not
the
scientific
tactics,
scientifically
72
to
74°C
for
15
seconds
good
enough
to
keep
pure
milk
for
around
20
days
safe
right.
Standard
milk
pasteurization
system
consists
of
the
following
parts
like
balance
tank
that
maintains
a
constant
head
for
the
coming
milk,
incoming
milk.
Milk
feed
pump
which
creates
suitable
pressure
that
is
4
necessary
for
efficient
flow.
Flow
control
system
that
ensures
sufficient
amount
of
fluid
in
the
conduits
at
any
given
time
filters
and
clarifiers
that
removes
dirt
from
the
products.
Then
homogenizer
that
divides
the
fat
globules
into
micro
globules
to
avoid
fat
separation
in
standing
milk.
Of
course,
homogenization
will
come
separately
in
detail
because
that
is
also
one
very
vital
step
in
milk
processing,
like
pasteurization
is
one
similarly
homogenization
is
another
also
standardization.
So,
these
three
we
will
cover
it
there
in
this
are
subsequently
class
very
thoroughly
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:45)
Then
we
come
to
this
that
PHE
that
is
plate
heat
exchanger
were
this
heat
transfer
takes
place
right.
Plate
heat
exchangers
on
like
that
so
many
plates
are
there
right.
So,
alternatively
this
may
go
like
this
and
may
come
like
this
is
one
way
and
if
I
could
change
the
pen
colour .
However ,
I
do
not
know
how
to
make
that.
So,
let
us
give
the
arrow .
So,
if
this
is
your
one
and
this
is
that
one
another ,
this
we
it
is
coming.
So,
another
thing
may
be
like
that
it
is
going
like
this
like
that
like
this
right
so,
that
may
be
another .
Now ,
depending
on
this
flow
in
PHE
I
am
not
of
course,
discussing
much
on
PHE
because
when
will
be
covering
the
entire
world
not
possible.
Plate
heat
exchanger
were
plates
are
there
and
depending
on
that
say
a
plate
looks
like
this
right
and
it
has
4
holes
so,
1
2
3
4.
5
So,
depending
on
which
hole
is
open
and
which
hole
is
close
say
this
one.
So,
it
will
come
here
and
fill
up
and
then
go
to
the
next
by
this
and
then
depending
on
the
next
one
to
where
it
is
open
maybe
this,
this,
this
and
that.
So,
where
it
is
open
may
be
say
this
one
is
open
and
all
these
are
closed.
So,
there
it
will
go
out.
So,
like
that
that
ports
are
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
in
one
plate
it
will
be
the
milk
and
the
other
plate
the
heating
medium
normal
it
is
steam,
normally
it
is
steam
right.
So,
that
way
the
plate
heat
exchanger
works
right.
So,
the
when
you
are
using
plate
heat
exchanger
then
you
can
have
the
regenerator .
(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:16)
Now ,
regenerator
means
that
your
as
again
which
said
so,
if
your
milk
has
come
like
this.
So,
this
milk
it
was
at
a
inlet
temperature
of
say
40°C
say
or
say
30°C
room
temperature.
Now ,
it
is
heated
to
73°C
right;
now
these
73°C
we
have
to
cool
right.
So,
these
extra
heat
if
you
can
extract
then
that
becomes
a
pre-coolant
for
the
other
or
pre-chilling
for
the
other
pre-heating
sorry
pre-heating
for
the
other .
So,
that
pre
heating
can
be
done
which
is
that
going
at
30
degree
now
with
that
can
be
made.
So,
that
is
again
getting
heat
exchange.
So,
that
the
exit
which
came
out
at
73°C
lot
of
heat
can
be
removed
from
that,
that
is
what
is
the
regeneration
right,
where
in
PHE
this
regeneration
or
heating
or
holding
and
cooling
this
can
be
done.
These
sections
are
also
very
much
important.
The
facilities
efficient
pasteurizations
for
these
selections
are
required,
these
section
selections
are
required.
Flow
diversion
valves
are
there
that
ensures
that
all
the
6
conditions
for
pasteurization
have
been
have
been
met
before
the
milk
access
through
because
ultimately
the
pasteurize
milk
will
be
assed
with
it
is
pasteurized
or
not.
So,
before
that
is
done.
So,
you
have
correctly
pasteurize
that
will
be
controlled
by
the
flow
direction
valve.
Instrumentation
and
control
equipment
there
is
one
of
the
primary ,
because
instrumentation
and
control
will
dictate
whether
the
time
temperature
combination
has
correctly
done
or
not
because
based
on
that
your
pasteurization
efficiency
will
depend.
So,
that
is
one
of
the
primary
as
your
selection
or
section
process
primary
section
when
you
are
selecting;
increases
system
efficiency
and
reliability .
Peripheral
sources
of
utilities
such
as
steam,
air
and
water ,
in
most
of
the
cases
as
I
said
the
heating
medium
is
steam.
In
most
of
the
cases
heating
medium
is
steam,
but
incases
it
can
be
water
also
right.
Normally ,
air
is
not
used
as
may
be
used
for
cooling,
but
not
for
that
right
because
air
is
not
a
good
medium
for
a
heat
transfer;
here
you
need
that
efficiency
it
to
be
high.
So,
steam
and
water
normal
is
use
hot
water .
So,
that
provides
the
necessary
utilities
for
heating
cooling
and
pressurized
environments.
Then
conduits
piping
system
there
are
because
if
it
is
not
a
small
unit
if
it
is
a
large
unit
so,
there
may
be
from
one
end
to
other
end
you
have
to
move
several
meters
or
several
10’s
of
meters
and
in
that
case
that
piping
properly
to
be
done.
One
good
example
if
you
are
very
close
to
Mother
Dairy
or
Amul
right
you
can
visit
and
see
how
exorbitant
those
systems
are
right.
Then
this
facilitates
flow
of
milk
and
utilities
from
one
point
to
the

Each
of
the
pasteurizer
sections
have,
each
of
the
pasteurizer
sections
has
been
designed
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
plate
heat
exchanger ,
ultimately
your
blood
heat
exchanger
efficiency
has
to
be
used.
So,
you
what
you
are
doing
you
are
regaining
or
regenerating
the
heat
so,
that
your
efficiency
of
the
plate
heat
exchanger
goes
up
and
again
when
you
learn
PHE,
plate
heat
exchanger
then
you
will
see
that
co-currency
and
counter
currency
these
are
the
two
terms
which
are
very
important.

(Refer
Slide
Time:

We
know
that
in
any
heat
exchanger
when
it
has
come
up
here
let
me
also
tell
that
if
any
heat
exchanger
if
it
is
parallel
heat
transfer
then
your
curve
looks
like
this
right.
And
if
it
is
a
counter
current
heat
exchanger
then
your
heat
transfer
looks
like
this.
So,
depending
on
whether
the
flow
was
parallel
or
counter
current
so,
that
word
which
is
coined
as
co-currency
or
counter
currency .
So,
how
much
co-current,
how
much
counter
current
that
will
depend
on
your
flow
in
the
through
the
plates.
So,
if
your
in
one
case
it
is
co-current
or
in
other
case
it
is
counter
current
then
your
represents
will
differing,
counter
will
be
better
than
the
co.
So,
how
much
co-current
how
much
counter
current
that
will
also
depend,
that
will
also
dictate
the
efficiencies
of
the
heat
exchanger
will
PHE
right.
So,
this
you
have
to
keep
in
mind.

(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:21)
Then
movement
of
milk
through
the
PHE
for
an
effective
pasteurization;
Chilled
milk
from
the
bulk
milk
tank
at
4°C
moves
into
the
balance
tank
from
where
it
is
pumped
into
the
degeneration
section
of
the
PHE,
regeneration
section
means
where
the
output
is
again
passed
through
the
input.
So,
that
there
is
also
an
heat
exchange
and
you
are
gaining
some
heat
from
the
already
pasteurized
milk
they
are
not
coming
directly
in
contact
of
course,
but
heat
exchanger
through
the
PHE
it
can
be
done.
So,
that
is
another
thing.
At
the
at
the
at
the
regenerative
heating
section
of
the
PHE,
chilled
milk
received
from
the
already
pasteurized
milk
leaving
the
system
and
heat
exchange
occurs
across
the
PHE
plates
in
a
counter
current
motion
of
the
two
fluids
of
the
different
temperatures
right.
And
this
if
we
cannot
show
the
video
here.
The
regenerative
heating
raises
the
temperature
of
the
milk
to
about
40°C
to
facilities
easy
standardization.
Heating
then
continues
to
60°C
to
facilitate
easy
homogenization
of
the
fat
globules.
Because,
homogenization
when
you
will
see
that
time
you
will
see
that
homogenization
is
also
dependent
on
the
temperature
of
homogenization
right.
Homogenization
efficiencies
is
increases
if
the
temperature
is
high,
if
the
temperature
is
low
homogenization
efficiency
also
decreases.
So,
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
right.
10
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:26)
Then
we
come
back
to
the
next.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:31)
That
is
after
clarification,
standardization
and
homogenization,
milk
passes
into
the
heating
section
where
milk
exchanges
heat
with
steam
across
the
PHE
plates.
The
steam
heats
the
milk
to
over
72°C
which
is
the
perfect
high
temperature
short
time
pasteurization
condition.
11
Once
the
milk
has
attained
the
pasteurization
temperatures
it
moves
into
the
holding
tubes.
The
length
of
these
tubes
have
been
calibrated
with
the
flow
rate
to
ensure
that
milk
stays
at
the
temperature
at
least
for
15-16
seconds,
16
seconds
is
for
all
safety
because
1
second
is
nothing
right.
So,
by
the
time
you
count
it
is
already
second
over.
So,
better
to
be
over
then
under
because
over
though
is
not
desirable
but
at
least
we
will
not
spoil
the
milk
in
future.
So,
you
can
rely
that
your
target
is
achieved.
So,
that
is
why
1
second
excess
that
is
why
15
second
we
have
said
16
seconds
if
you
measure
and
the
length
is
designed
such
a
way
that
it
moves
through
16
seconds
are
in
the
holding
section.
So,
this
time
is
sufficient
to
destroy
the
target
organisms
or
pathogens
according
to
the
D-value
which
you
have
already
seen
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:25)
Now ,
if
the
milk
fails
to
attain
the
required
temperatures,
the
flow
diversion
valve
diverts
is
flow
back
to
the
heating
section
to
ensure
that
the
temperatures
are
sufficient
to
kill
all
the
target
pathogens
and
their
spores.
This
is
the
vital
thing
that
might
not
had
been
chance
that
temperature
could
not
have
been
attained
whereas
it
as
pass
through
the
exit
valve
then
what
to
do.
So,
there
is
a
flow
diversion
valve
by
which
the
this
fluid
is
again
this
milk
is
again
diverted
to
the
heating
sections
such
that
all
the
organisms
are
target
organisms
are
killed
or
target
12
organisms
are
killed
so,
that
the
pathogenic
are
also
automatically
killed.
Once
the
milk
is
fully
pasteurized,
it
moves
back
to
the
regenerative
heating
section
to
raise
the
temperature
of
the
chilled
milk.
In
the
process
the
temperature
of
the
outbound
pasteurized
milk
drops
to
about
32°C
such
a
good
heat
transfer
such
a
good
heat
exchanger
right.
That
the
outbound
temperature
is
the
exit
of
the
already
pasteurized
after
chilling
after
heat
exchange
in
regeneration
section
it
comes
down
to
32°C.
Pasteurized
milk
then
moves
to
the
cooling
section
of
the
pasteurizer
where
chilled
water
or
PHE
coolant
that
is
your
that
there
in
this
case
coolant
is
one
which
one
which
is
going
for
pasteurization.
So,
that
is
the
coolant
because
that
is
already
chilled
it
is
started
with
4
degree
so,
it
is
it
is
getting
it
is
it
is
chilling
the
outlet
of
the
pasteurized
milk
and
that
is
brought
down
32.
And
this
is
again
going
up
to
around
40
because
you
started
from
72
right,
further
lowers
its
temperature
to
4°C
ok.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
27:03)
Then
because
ultimately
this
32°C
you
have
to
again
brought
down
to
4
degree.
So,
that
we
safely
kept
for
long
time.
Now ,
advantage
of
regenerative
heating
is
that
there
are
lot
many
advantage
that
utilization
of
the
incoming
chilled
milk
to
cool
the
outgoing
hot
pasteurization
milk
increases
the
13
efficiency
of
the
PHE.
A
smaller
amount
of
heat
energy
is
required
to
heat
the
milk
to
pasteurization
temperature
since,
the
heating
does
not
start
from
4
degree
centigrade.
Had
it
been
you
are
you
just
calculate
mc
p
Δ
T
for
a
given
m,
for
a
given
c
p
if
Δ
T
in
this
case
will
be
from
4
to
72
is
68°C
whereas,
if
it
is
preheated
or
if
with
the
residual
heat
having
the
already
pasteurized
milk.
So,
that
is
exchanging.
So,
it
is
brought
to
around
40
degree.
So,
you
are
mc
p
Δ
T
will
be
from
72-42
so,
around
32
degree
30-32°C.
So,
heat
requirement
will
be
much
lower ,
efficiency
of
the
pasteurizer
will
go
up.
So,
this
is
the
good
system
for
regeneration
of
heat.
So,
reduces
the
amount
of
time
required
to
pasteurized
milk
and
you
must
keep
in
mind
that
when
starting
the
process
of
pasteurized
in
the
PHE,
milk
is
circulated
in
the
heating
section
until
it
attains
the
required
temperature
required
temperature
before
regenerative
heating
begins
right.
So,
starting
the
process
of
pasteurization
should
be
such
that
the
PHE
that
milk
is
re-circulated
or
circulated
in
the
heating
section,
until
it
attains
the
required
temperature
before
the
regenerative
heating
begins
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:13)
So,
now
let
us
go
very
quickly
this
because
our
time
is
very
small
may
not
be
there.
So,
low
temperature
long
time
similarly
this
method
is
best
for
batch
pasteurization
that
we
know .
Let
14
us
look
into
batch
pasteurization
for
home
use
ok.
We
will
also
review
the
ice
cream
mix,
cream
pasteurizer
that
is
capable
for
commercial
use
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:40)
And
ultra
high
temperature
pasteurizer
so,
where
it
is
very
high
around
135°C,
135°C
to
150°C
result
for
one
of
two
seconds.
It
is
ultra
high
temperature
or
UHT
milk
that
can
be
kept
for
nine
months
without
refrigeration.
So,
despite
the
risk
of
Millard
browning,
UHT
pasteurization
remains
the
most
popular
milk
preservation
method
for
safe
and
stable
milk
right.
So,
up
to
UHT
pasteurization
let
us
stop
today
because
our
time
is
up.
Thank
you.
