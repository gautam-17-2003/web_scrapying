Milk
Fat
(Contd.)
So,
we
were
discussing
about
triglycerides
that
is
the
fat,
right.
In
general
we
have
discussed
in
many
as
we
said,
so
today
is
our
23rd
lecture,
so
in
that
we
will
continue
discussion
with
fat,
right,
so
typically
milk
fat
that
will
discuss.
So,
to
do
that
you
remember
last
day
we
finished
at
this
point
that
size
of
the
fat
globule
can
vary
between
2
to
30
somewhere
around
this
micron
in
size,
there
are
many
which
are
less
than
20,
but
very
few
more
than
20.
Instead
that
is
why
generally
it
is
said
between
20
to
2
to
30
microns.
And
also
we
said
a
drop
of
fat
globule
and
net
drop
equivalent
to
I
said
if
you
remember
that
we
take
in
pipette
or
burette.
So,
that
drop
which
comes
from
pipette
or
burette
that
is
generally
taken
as
a
drop
and
this
droplet.
So,
this
droplet
size
is
roughly
0.05
millimeter
milliliter ,
right.
Millimeter
is
the
unit
of
one
dimensions
milliliter .
So,
that
is
the
volume.
So,
that
0.05
one
droplet,
one
that
is
one
what
we
should
write
one
in
drop
or
one
droplet
of
milk
it
contains
around
10
to
the
power
8
number
of
fat
globules.
So,
imagine
so
how
many
fat
globules
you
consume
when
you
are
consume
a
glass
of
milk,
maybe
one
quarter
of
a
liter
or
half
liter
some
things
like
that.
So,
so
many
droplet
us
you
of
or
so
many
number
of
fat
globules
you
are
taking,
right.
So,
in
this
fat
globule;
so
we
also
said
that
there
is
a
membrane
which
protects
the
fat
globule,
right.
So,
that
we
said
fat
globule
membrane
that
is
FGM,
right.
Now ,
if
you
come
to
composition
of
milk
fat
then
it
is
not
a
single
chemical
compound,
it
is
mixture
of
several
dif ferent
glycerides.
The
other
day
I
said
that
milk
fat
contains
around
98
percent
triglycerides,
if
you
remember
we
had
said
that
around
98
percent
triglycerides
some
sterols
and
some
others
maybe
phospholipids
are
there,
right.
So,
or ganic
acids
consisted
rather ,
or ganic
acid
those
are
in
milk
fat
and
fats
from
other
sources
other
than
milk
fat
are
commonly
known
as
fatty
acids.
So,
this
fatty
acid
we
have
already
discussed,
right.
So,
animal
fats
are
relatively
simple
as
compared
with
milk
fat.
Because
they
don’ t
have
so
many
complications
because
so
many
numbers
of
fats
are
not
present
whereas,
in
milk
fat
we
said
the
other
day
around
400
this
your
fatty
acid
groups
could
be
associated
if
you
remember
we
had
said,
right.
So,
it
is
it
is
really
a
worst
number
of
fatty
acids
associated
with
the
milk
fat,
but
it
is
not
so,
tricky
or
it
is
not
so,
complicated
in
case
of
if
the
fat
comes
or
fat
is
obtained
from
animal
sources,
right.
So,
let
us
look
into.
Beef
fat
this
contains
around
many
triglycerides
ok,
and
they
are
palmitic
stearic
and
oleic
acid,
right.;
consists
of
glycerides
of
palmitic
stearic
and
oleic
acids.
Mutton
tallow
that
is
glyceride
of
of
stearic
acid.
So,
beef
fat
mutton
fat
they
are
and
mutton
fat
is
known
called
tallow
and
in
some
cases
they
are
also
called
lar ge
animals
fat,
right.
So,
they
are
it
is
another .
So,
it
is
much
simpler ,
you
see
we
said
that
palmitic
stearic
and
oleic
this
is
for
the
beef
fat
whereas,
in
mutton
fat
there
is
a
tallow
it
is
only
the
glyceride
of
mainly
stearic
acid
blood.
So,
it
is
much
much
simpler .
In
milk
we
have
seen
it
is
n
numbers
of
such
kind
of
fatty
acids
are
present.
So,
that
is
why
we
said
that
animal
fat
is
much
more
simpler
compared
to
that
of
the
milk
fat.
Lard
another
animal
fat
which
is
glyceride
of
oleic
acid,
right.
Lard
is
a
glyceride
of
oleic
acid.
Though
these
of
course,
if
you
remember
the
other
day
we
said
saturated
unsaturated,
so
mostly
these
are
unsaturated,
right.
Saturated
fatty
acids
and
that
is
why
they
are
they
are
they
are
they
are
value
is
also
not
so
high,
right.
I
gave
also
the
example
of
the
market
if
you
go
to
the
market
then
you
get
lot
of
fats
of
animal
of
dif ferent
animals,
right.
And
they
are
normally
either
thrown
or
may
be
sold
at
very
very
nominal
prices,
right.
The
primarily
reason
is
that
they
are
containing
very
very
simple
types
of
glycerides
and
mainly
the
higher
number
of
carbon
atoms
C
16,
C
18
like
that.
So,
the
palmitic
stearic
oleic
it
normally
they
confined
to
these,
right.
So,
if,
but
in
button
milk
fat
if
you
look
at
milk
fat
contains,
milk
fat
contains
butyric
acid,
caproic
acids,
caprilic
acid,
capric
acid,
lauric
acid,
myristic
acid,
palmitic
acids,
stearic
acid
and
oleic
acid.
So,
it
consists
of
everything
its
small
chain
carbon
with
long
chain
carbon,
right.
And
if
you
remember
we
are
said
the
generally
naturally
available
this
fatty
acids
they
range
between
2
to
20
around
right.
Beyond
20
it
goes
to
what?
Y ou
remember;
yeah
it
goes
to
waxes,
right.
Beyond
24
it
goes
to
waxes
that
class,
right,
but
they
are
also
lipids
all
are
on
the
lipid
family .
And
here
we
see
both
the
small
chain
carbon
carboxylic
acid
and
lar ge
chain
carbon
carboxylic
acids
are
present
in
milk,
right.
So,
they
are
butyric,
caprioc,
caprylic,
capric,
the
lauric,
myristic,
palmitic,
stearic
and
oleic
acids,
right.
So,
because
of
the
presence
of
so
wide
variety
of
your
this
acid
that
is
the
carboxylic
acid
that
is
fatty
acid.
So,
there
are
both
volatile
and
non
volatile
components
of
the
milk
fat
which
comes
out,
right.
So,
milk
fat
contains
both
volatile
and
non
volatile
as
you
see
those
which
are
soluble
and
volatile
as
its
they
comprise
of
butyric.
Y ou
remember
the
other
day
I
said
that
odd
or
even
it
depends
on
how
you
are
defining.If
you
define
taking
carboxylic
acid
as
the
unit
also
then
butyric
acid
becomes
4
C
4,
but
if
you
remove
carboxylic
acid
and
only
concentrate
on
the
chain
of
the
carbon
length
then
butyric
acid
becomes
C
3.
This
is
like
in
this
case
we
are
giving
example
of
C
3
earlier
we
said
that
those
which
are
which
are
which
are
available
in
which
are
available
in
natural
resources
or
natural
sources
they
are
primarily
of
the
even
number
of
carbon,
right.
But
here
it
is
being
seen
that
if
we
remove
that
carboxylic
acid
group
then
it
becomes
C
3
for
butyric
acid.
Similarly ,
for
caprioc
acid
it
is
C
5,
for
caprylic
acid
it
is
C
7,
for
capric
acid
it
is
C
9,
for
insoluble
and
nonvolatile
is
say
this.
So,
the
soluble
part
soluble
volatile
part
is
between
C
3
to
C
9
less
than
C
10,
or
if
it
is
in
odd
even
number
then
with
the
acid
we
can
say
C
4
to
C
10
not
including
the
carboxylic
acid
group.
But
if
it
is
without
the
carboxylic
acid
group
then
it
is
C
3
to
C
9,
right.
Like
butyric
caproic
capric
caprilic
all
these
are
soluble
volatile
fatty
acids.
Whereas,
insoluble
and
non
volatile
fatty
acids
are
consisting
up
of
comprises
of
C
1 1
that
is
lauric
acid,
C
13
that
is
myristic
acid,
C
15
that
is
palmitic
acid,
C
17
that
is
stearic
acid,
and
also
C
17
for
oleic
acid,
right.
So,
all
these
are
non
volatile
fatty
acids
components
whereas,
volatile
fatty
acids
components
are
less
than
10
and
more
than
10
are
non
volatile.
So,
this
10
I
am
referring
with
respect
to
both
whether
it
is
odd
number
or
even
number .
It
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
odd
number
or
even
number
it
is
a
less
than
10
does
not
matter
whether
it
is
odd
number
or
even
number
it
is
higher
than
10
greater
than
10
for
insoluble
once,
right.
Now ,
again
hardness
or
softness
of
milk
fat
and
their
relation
to
the
texture
of
butter
that
depends
primarily
on.
No,
it
is
went
to.
Non
volatile
group
of
the
fatty
acids,
right
which
constitute
around
82.7
percent
non
volatile
group
of
fatty
acids.So,
non
volatile
group
means
more
than
10
carbon
length,
non
less
than
10
was
volatile.
So,
non
volatile
group
of
fatty
acids
that
is
between
1 1
to
C
17
without
the
carboxylic
acid
group,
right.
And
out
of
that
around
82.7
percent
is
the
non
volatile
fraction
of
the
milk
fat,
right.
Next
we
come
to
that
the
rancid
flavor
that
sometimes
occurs
in
dairy
products
is
is
lar gely
due
to
the
liberation
of
the
butyric
acid.
I
don’ t
know
whether
in
any
of
the
lab
laboratory
you
have
seen
on
you
go
and
see
that
butyric
acid
generally
in
chemistry
labs
this
is
available.
So,
you
go
and
get
butyric
acid
and
take
a
smell
of
it
you
just
cannot
it
is
so
obnoxious,
so
obnoxious
that
you
just
cannot
the
moment
it
comes
to
automatically
you
will
get
jump
or
you
will
take
a
jump,
right.
So,
that
is
primarily
because
butyric
acid
is
very
very
bad
very
very
of f
flavor .
So,
that
is
what
is
liberated
when
milk
becomes
rancid,
right.
And
rancidity
can
be
cause
by
many
many
things
like
it
can
be
enzymatic
rancidity
or
it
can
be
oxidative
rancidity .
So,
depending
on
what,
but
generally
the
products
could
be
similar
or
alike.
So,
it
is
butyric
acid
is
one
of
this
product
which
comes
out
from
the
rancidity
and
that
causes
very
very
of f
flavor .
So,
if
milk
is
not
consumed
and
if
it
is
getting
rancid
after
sometime
then
the
of f
flavor
which
comes
out
from
the
milk
is
primarily
because
of
the
butyric
acid,
right.
So,
this
you
keep
in
mind.
Milk
fat
does
not
have
a
true
melting
point.
Why?
Because
whenever
you
are
finding
out
melting
point,
whatever
be
the
process
method
whenever
you
are
finding
out
the
melting
point
you
have
seen
that
the
melting
point
can
be
determine
if
you
have
a
single
component
exactly ,
right.
Y ou
can
tell
ice
has
a
melting
point
of
0
degree
centigrade,
right.
But
if
you
have
ice
dry
ice
combination
then
can
you
say
that
it
has
a
0
degree
melting
point,
not
at
all
because
that
is
a
mixture
and
both
of
them
have
dif ferent
melting
points.
So,
it
is
not
a
single
isolated
melting
point
as
it
is.
So,
that
is
what
when
we
are
considering
milk
fat
it
does
not
have
any
single
point
melting
point
because
it
contains
many
many
triglycerides
many
many
fats
and
that
is
why
it
is
not
a
single
component
it
is
a
range
and
this
range
varies
between
29
to
36
degree
centigrade,
this
range
varies
between
29
to
30
degrees
36
degree
centigrade,
right.
The
solidifying
point
of
the
temperature
the
solidifying
point
or
the
temperature
at
which
milk
appears
solid
that
also
varies
and
this
is
between
10
to
12,
for
the
same
reason
as
the
melting
point
is
dif ferent
solidifying
point
is
also
dif ferent.
Of
course,
normally
what
we
know
like
for
ice
we
know
that
it
is
melting
and
also
solidifying
both
at
0
degree
centigrade
because
that
is
a
single
component
it
turns,
but
here
it
is
a
mixture.
So,
that
is
why
the
ranges
are
dif ferent
and
melting
and
solidifying
points
are
also
quite
dif ferent,
right.
So,
the
solidifying
point
or
the
temperate
at
which
milk
fat
appears
solid
is
around
10
to
12
degree
centigrade.
Specific
gravity
of
milk
again
specific
gravity
is
a
function
of
temperature;
I
hope
you
have
not
for gotten
that
in
school
you
have
measured
specific
gravity
in
a
specific
gravity
bottle.
And
if
you
would
remember
that
in
that
bottle
it
was
specifically
written
that
at
should
such
and
such
temperature,
right.
Because
why?
Because
your
specific
gravity
bottle
you
when
you
have
taken
you
say
this
is
the
specific
gravity
bottle
by
any
chance
if
this
is
a
specific
gravity
bottle
you
have
taken
the
liquid
inside.
So,
the
weight
which
you
have
taken
is
not
changing
with
temperature,
but
what
is
changing
with
temperature
the
expansion
or
contraction
that
is
the
volume.
So,
since
the
volume
is
changing
so
that
is
why
the,
that
is
why
the
specific
gravity
is
always
mention
at
a
given
temperature,
right.
Y ou
will
see
the
same
material
will
have
dif ferent
specific
gravity
at
dif ferent
temperatures
that
you
just
look
into
any
substance,
any
material
you
take
we
eat
food
and
non
food
does
not
matter ,
but
it
is
that
a
specific
gravity
is
a
function
of
temperature,
right.
So,
specific
gravity
of
milk
is
0.9
at
60
degree
centigrade,
at
60
degree
centigrade
it
is
0.9,
right.
The.
Now ,
factors
which
influence
the
composition
of
milk
as
we
said
that
there
are
many
many
factors
some
of
them
we
discussed
here
if
possible
in
future
if
we
come
acrosssimilar
topic
then
we
may
discuss
some
in
more.
But
the
fact
in
primary
factors
for
which
the
composition
of
the
milk
fat
varies
are
because
of
the
principal
fat
known
to
vary
is
because
of
is
butyrin,
olein,
palmitin,
stearin
these
are
the
principal
fat
or
principal
fat
which
are
responsible
for
majority
of
the
fact
that
is
butyrin,
olein,
palmitin
and
stearin.
Now ,
factors
which
are
responsible
for
variation
of
the
these
fat
content
are
breed
of
the
animal
we
said
earlier
breed
of
the
animal
say
you
are
taking
cow .
So,
that
breed
whether
it
is
jersey
breed
holstein
breed
or
say
some
Indian
breed
obviously ,
the
fat
contents
are
quite
dif ferent.
I
do
not
know
we
all
we
had
one
dairy
farm
in
our
institute
and
there
we
had
seen
that
from
Australia
this
jersey
cows
came
and
their
size
is
so
big,
so
beautiful
health,
so
stout
and
they
used
to
also
they
used
to
give
both
the
quantity
wise
much
more
as
well
the
fat
content
was
very
high
compared
to
when
we
are
considering
from
our
house
to
house
some
or
other
kind
of
cow
animal,
right.
So,
it
depends
on
the
breed
for
the
same
animal
breed.
And
after
words
you
will
see
from
the
same
breed
species
to
species.
If
that
breed
whether
it
is
Indian
variety
or
Australian
variety
or
Netherland
variety
whatever
we
eat
the
same
breed
of
dif ferent
species,
right.
So
they
will
also
very
dif ferently
this
will
come.
Then
stage
of
lactation,
stage
of
lactation.
So
after
the
birth
after
the
birth
of
the
animal
so
that
is
called
the
lactation
period
and
this
is
generally
up
to
1
year
and
this
is
the
that
varies
this
lactation
period
because
of
the
lactation
variation
of
the
lactation
period
the
contents
that
is
butyric
acid
contain
declines
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
lactation
period,
right.
In
the
beginning
with
a
butyric
acid
content
is
high
whereas,
towards
the
end
butyric
acid
content
is
much
much
lower ,
right.
So,
that
is
why
I
don’ t
know
how
many
of
you
again
I
am
referring
to
this
how
many
of
you
have
ever
visited
any
such
units
where
at
home
or
domestically
the
animals
are
reared
and
you
went
there
and
took
the
milk
from
the
cow ,
and
that
time
your
seniors
if
you
are
first
time
or
may
not
be
that
much
experienced
in
bringing
milk
every
day .
So,
then
you
might
have
been
told
that
be
sure
that
in
that
house
there
is
some
cow
has
given
some
birth
of
the
calf
and
do
not
take
milk
from
that,
right.
That
could
be
the
smell
of
that
is
a
quite
dif ferent,
the
fat
contents
are
dif ferent,
all
are
dif ferent
that
is
why
lactation
period
is
a
major
cause
for
the
dif ferentiation
in
the
fat
content
as
well
as
the
composition
of
defect.Then
primarily
feed,
feed
is
a
very
very
vital
component
for
the
variation
why
because
in
our
particularly
in
our
country
all
over
the
country
you
will
see
that
yeah
in
a
in
many
many
cities
or
metros
nowadays
those
kind
of
milk
house
rearing
facilities
are
not
allowed
because
of
the
urbanization.
But
in
villages
you
will
see
lot
many
are
there.
And
what
do
they
do?
They
allow
the
animal
to
go
here
and
there
and
get
whatever
food
they
want.
But
this
is
not
so,
in
any
developed
countries
in
an
developed
countries
they
do
rear
commercially
and
there
are
maybe
hundreds
and
thousands
of
animals
are
being
reared
regularly
feed,
with
the
good
food
which
is
suitable
for
them
and
those
animals
do
also
payback
the
output
as
well
as
the
fat
content
of
the
milk.
So,
that
kind
of
commercialization
in
our
country
I
do
not
know
when
it
will
come,
unless
several
decades
where
there
was
white
revolution
by
courier
our
respected
Kurien
and
after
that
such
kind
of
revolution
or
such
kind
of
thinking
is
not
coming
up.
So,
I
hope
my
students
who
are
now ,
listening
if
they
come
to
the
apex
body
they
will
take
care
of
such
this
kind
of
problem
that
the
let
they
are
be,
let
they
are
be
consolidated
rearing
of
the
animals
so
that
the
rearing
become
also
easier
as
well
your
this
thing
becomes
very
very
fruitful.
So,
feed
is
one
such
it
is
not
that
they
go
around
and
take
their
food
accordingly .
Now ,
feed,
so
increase
in
olein
content
produces
soft
fat
with
low
melting
point.
For
cottonseed
meal
increase
in
olein
is
counteracted
by
the
decrease
in
butyrin.
Feeds
result
in
higher
olein
content
rich
in
vegetable
oils
such
as
linseed
meal,
soybean
meal,
etcetera.
Grass
pasture
increases
olein
content
feeds
with
low
vegetables
oil,
but
rich
in
carbohydrates
produces
less
olein
content
that
is
firmer ,
firmer
fat
is
available,
right
and
nutrition
that
is
decline
in
the
volatile
acids
and
increase
in
the
olein
content.
So,
these
are
the
some
of
the,
some
of
the
dif ferent
reasons
why
the
variation
of
fat
content
both
in
quantity
as
well
as
composition
for
the
for
the
milk
it
varies,
right.
So,
here
we
stop
because
time
is
up.
W e
stop
it
here.
Thank
you.
