Milk
Pasteurization
and
Homogenization
(Contd.)
So,
we
stop
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
that
milk
pasteurization
and
organization
continuation
class.
So,
there
we
have
said
that
what
are
the
steps
required
for
pasteurization.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:30)
Now,
will
go
quickly
because
our
this
45th
class,
so
15
more
classes
already
left.
So,
we
cannot
we
cannot
elaborate,
so
much
though
these
slides
will
be
with
you.
So,
you
can
also
go
through,
but
I
will
not
highlight,
so
much
as
we
had
been
doing.
So,
milk
chilling
that
is
one
chilling
is
not
a
pasteurization
process,
but
it
is
a
necessary
step
when
dealing
with
large
volumes
of
milk.
Milk
leaves
the
cows
under
at
temperature
this
is
why
required
because
this
is
pre-pasteurization
steps,
before
beginning
of
the
pasteurization
you
need
to
because
what
you
are
doing
you
are
in
the
bulk.
When
you
are
getting
from
different
places
you
are
storing
them
in
one
place
that
is
why
chilling
is
a
must,
because
already
heating
has
not
started
pasteurization
is
the
first
process
where
you
are
heating
is
being
done,
but
before
that
when
you
are
a
accumulating
all
milk
from
different
sources.
So,1
that
that
you
have
to
keep
them
under
chilled
condition
that
is
why
chilling
prior
to
your
pasteurization
is
required
right.
So,
that
more
I
will
not
will
not
follow
them
right,
so
chilling
may
affect
the
quality
of
the
product
negatively
if
it
is
kept
for
a
long
time,
because
psychotrophic
bacteria
will
cause
proteolysis
for
protein
which
leads
to
bitter
flavor
attributed
to
the
released
polypeptides
right;
that
means,
that
you
thought
you
will
bring
all
milk
from
different
places
and
then
after
couple
of
days
you
will
start
doing
that
processing
of
pasteurization
not
at
all
encourage
able,
because
I
said
earlier
that
there
are
three
types
of
bacteria
that
is
psychrophilic,
mesophilic
and
thermophilic.
So,
when
you
are
chilling
psychrophiles
will
be
there,
so
they
may
act
on
the
proteins
and
rest
and
may
contribute
to
bad
flavor
odor
color
etcetera
all
negative.
So,
that
is
not
desirable,
so
chilling
you
do
chill,
but
not
for
a
long
time;
so,
that
that
those
organisms
can
grow
and
act
on
your
product
right.
So,
this
is
one
very
vital
step
you
have
to
remember
or
keep
in
mind
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
03:42)
Then
prolonged
chilling
introduces
alterations
to
the
structure
of
the
casein
micelles
and
increases
the
coagulation
time.
Now,
effect
of
chilling
on
milk
what
are
their
impeding
rennet
acid
coagulation.
2
So,
lowering
the
temperature
to
2°C
causes
the
milk
not
to
coagulate
even
after
rennet
acid
treatment.
So,
even
is
too
cold
then
even
if
you
do
rennet
that
is
one
type
of
enzyme
available
in
the
in
the
calf
your
that
in
the
calf
belly
from
there
it
is
coming
stomach
of
the
calf
it
is
coming
and
or
rennet
or
other
coagulant
like
your
lactic
acid
producing
organisms
even
then
they
are
or
even
if
you
directly
put
acid
they
are
not.
So,
good
to
separate
the
fat,
protein
that
is
channa.
So,
very
low
temperature
is
also
not
desirable
for
different
purposes.
So,
this
phenomenon
has
been
utilized
continuous
cheese
making
process
in
which
the
temperatures
are
raised
after
addition
of
the
acid
coagulated
big
and
that
begins
when
the
temperature
reaches
around
15
to
30°C
that
is
one
application
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:30)
Then
no
coagulation
of
milk
is
at
isoelectric
point,
so
even
after
adjusting
the
pH
of
casein,
casein
to
isoelectric
point
the
milk
will
not
coagulate
if
the
temperature
ranges
between
2
to
5°C.
So,
you
have
brought
down
the
pH
4.6,
that
is
the
isoelectric
point,
but
even
then
coagulation
is
not
taking
place,
so
that
is
the
bad
part
of
the
chilled
right.
The
best
example
at
home
you
ask
your
mummy
that
when
you
are
making
channa,
if
the
milk
was
in
the
freezer,
I
do
not
say
that
in
the
deep
freezer
if
the
milk
was
in
the
freezer
which
is
in
good
condition
and
if
the
temperature
is
too
low.
Then
if
whether
she
had
put
any
time
any
acid
like
maybe
generally
at
home
you
acid
citric
acid
that
is
the
cite
coming
from
even
orange
or
lemon
and
coming
from
the
lemon.
So,
that
citric
acid
is
added
whether
3
coagulation
took
place
or
not
to
ask
and
most
of
the
time
she
will
say
no
she
prefers,
before
adding
to
heat
that
milk
and
bring
it
to
the
certain
temperature
and
then
add
then
only
coagulation
takes
place.
So,
this
is
a
negative
part
of
the
too
cold.
Low
temperature
can
encourage
the
formation
of
many
diffusible
inorganic
salts
that
distorts
the
micellar
structure
of
the
casein
leading
to
formation
of
more
micellar
or
soluble
casein.
Consequently ,
one
you
have
to
lower
the
pH
of
the
medium
further
to
achieve
complete
coagulation.
However,
acid
coagulation
leads
to
formation
of
a
less
rubbery
coagulum
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:00)
We
are
moving
fast
because
chilling
increases
viscosity
of
milk
that
is
true
this
is
more
prominent
when
you
will
understand
much
when
your
ice
cream
mix
is
being
chilled
after
pasteurize
homogenized
and
aged,
for
couple
of
hours
to
increase
the
viscosity.
So,
when
you
go
to
ice
cream
hopefully
we
will
deal
with
better
or
in
a
bigger
way
right.
So,
viscosity
of
milk
largely
depends
on
its
colloidal
components
of
which
proteins
forms
the
bulk
part
chilling,
changes
the
structure
of
the
milk
proteins
leading
to
an
increase
in
their
bulk,
hence
the
increase
in
milk
viscosity
at
chilled
temperatures
chilling
decreases
the
curd
firmness,
cheese
curd
firmness.
So,
that
is
another
disadvantage
right,
so
milk
chilling
affects
the
ratio
of
calcium
to
phosphate,
hence
their
interaction
in
the
colloid
solution
a
drop
in
this
ratio
leads
to
an
increase
in
the
duration
it
takes
for
milk
to
coagulate
to
encounter
this
problem
and
add
calcium
chloride
to
cheese
milk
before
cold
aging
starts
right.

(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:45)
Then
increases
hydrolytic
rancidity
in
milk
chilling,
chilling
exposes
the
casein
micelle
and
releases
the
lipases
into
the
medium
as
the
temperature
rise
gently
or
when
the
medium
is
gently
agitated
the
lipases
get
active
and
attack
the
fat
globules
and
release
the
fatty
acids
leading
to
rancidity,
so
that
is
also
bad.
Increased
foaming
in
milk
chilled
milk
foams
easily
due
to
the
increased
activity
of
the
beta
lactoglobulin.
Which
is
a
surfactant
and
milk
protein
coalesce
add
the
surface
or
lamellae
of
the
protein
which
also
traps
air
leading
to
formation
of
air
bubbles.
Then
chilling
leads
to
an
increased
clustering
of
a
of
fat,
chilling
milk
encourages
change
formation
in
the
surface
of
the
fat
globules
which
encourages
the
globules
to
stick
together
the
clustering
of
fat
globules
is
leads
to
an
increased
creaming
rate
in
cold
milk.

(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:17)
Pre-heating
or
regeneration
this
is
another,
but
so
chilling
part
we
have
finished
that
pre
chilling
if
it
is
too
cold
if
it
is
for
longer
period
what
is
the
bad
effect
those
we
are
dealt
with
right.
Now,
I
go
to
pre
heating
you
remember
we
have
said
that
in
most
of
the
most
of
the
pasteurizers
commercial.
The
pasteurizer
because
pasteurization
what
do
you
are
doing
you
are
heating.
So,
when
you
are
heating
and
after
eating
you
are
cooling
them
sharply.
So,
if
you
are
doing
that,
so
you
are
then
heating
and
cooling
simultaneously .
So,
lot
of
lot
of
energy
you
are
employing
to
overcome
this
if
you
can
utilize
that
you
are
you
just
said
that
you
have
you
have
accumulated
from
different
sources
milk
and
this
milk
when
you
are
pasteurizing
heating
before
that
you
have
chilled.
So,
that
temperature
is
low,
so
before
it
is
going
to
pasteurizer
if
this
temperature
could
be
used
by
the
heat
exchange
that
is
called
regeneration
by
regional
heating,
because
already
pasteurized
milk
that
can
act
as
a
pre
heater
for
this
chilled
milk
that
is
what
here
we
are
doing.
So,
pre
heating
pre
heating
and
standardization
stage,
after
bulking
the
chilled
milk
is
heated
to
about
40
degree
centigrade
to
facilated
easy
separation
of
butter
fat
during
standardization.
The
system
uses
regenerative
of
heating,
that
is
it
uses
the
heat
of
the
already
pasteurized
milk
to
heat
of
the
inoculum
or
incoming
rather
incoming
chilled
milk,
the
chilled
milk
in
a
counter
current
flow
cools
down
in
the
pasteurized
milk,
purpose
of
the
standardization
is
to
obtain
product
with
uniform
constituent
of
butter
fat
different
products
can
be
obtained
from
6
this
process
for
example,
skim
milk,
standardized
milk,
low
fat
milk,
high
fat
milk
etcetera
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:00)
Then
after
doing
this
pre
heating
or
regeneration
you
are
going
to
after
determining
the
type
of
product
you
are
making,
you
can
use
a
computer
program
or
any
standardization
method
to
determine
the
amount
of
cream
separation
or
amount
of
cream
to
be
separated,
or
to
separate
this
will
leave
you
with
the
desired
amount
of
butter
fat
to
standardize
milk.
Then
this
step
comes
in
is
the
clarification
right,
clarification
stage
because
if
you
are
not
clarifying
the
milk
that
if
it
contains
some
undesirable
things
which
are
visible
or
which
you
can
fill,
so
that
has
to
be
separated.
So,
that
is
done
under
this
segment
that
is
clarification
stage.
So,
in
this
what
you
are
doing
clarification
is
essential
for
removing
all
foreign
matter
from
the
product
large
solid
particles
are
removed
by
straining
the
milk
through
tubular
metallic
filters
a
centrifugal
separator
also
or
clarifier
not
the
one
used
for
standardization
is
used
to
remove
all
an
all
soil
and
sediments
from
the
milk.
The
filters
usually
fitted
in
parallel
twins
permits
continuous
processing
as
one
can
be
cleaned
while
the
other
running.
So,
that
is
the
use
ease,
so
one
both
are
in
parallel.
So,
one
it
is
running
and
another
is
being
cleaned
and
another
is
running
the
former
one
is
being
cleaned,
so
that
is
when
clean
one.
7
So,
clean
the
filters
regularly
between
2
to
10
operation
hours
depending
on
the
level
of
that
relevant
encountered
to
avoid
growth
of
the
organisms.
So,
otherwise
if
you
are
not
cleaning
then
what
will
happen
this
milk
which
was
residing
inside?
So,
that
will
be
a
very
good
source
of
the
organisms
to
grow.
So,
that
may
contaminate
that
may
unnecessarily
add
the
microbial
population
or
microbial
load
to
the
milk
right
that
is
not
desirable.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:43)
Then
after
this
perhaps
you
are
going
to
standardize,
now
standardization
is
a
process
which
is
in
most
of
the
cases
in
commercial
food,
commercial
milk
is
required
because
unless
you
standardize
because
you
remember
you
are
got
from
the
different
sources
different
milk.
So,
they
content
different
quantities
of
fat,
protein
or
SNF
all
these.
So,
if
you
are
adding
them
then
you
can
never
be
sure
that
what
is
the
your
final
constituent.
So,
after
adding
you
must
know
what
is
the
composition
and
then
you
already
have
decided,
I
will
sell
I
will
sell
market
with
this
that
is
this
quantity
of
fat,
this
quantity
of
solid
not
fat
etcetera.
So,
that
is
standardize,
so
that
is
why
standardization
is
a
must.
So,
it
is
important
to
standardize
milk
fat
to
ensure
that
you
end
up
with
a
product
of
persistent
quality
in
the
market
different
consumers
prefer
different
products
there
are
customers
who
will
consume
skim
milk
only
while
there
are
some
who
will
take
low
fat
milk,
there
are
those
who
will
take
standardized
milk
while
there
are
those
who
prefer
high
fat
milk.
8
So,
lot
of
variety
of
customers
you
have
to
handle
that
is
why
standardization
is
must
with
respect
to
their
product,
standardization
is
necessary
to
ensure
that
all
the
customers
are
created
all
the
customers
are
catered
for
again
it
is
during
the
process
of
standardization
that
you
get
to
separate
the
butter
fat
that
is
used
for
making
cream
right.
So,
cream
making
you
are
using
separation
of
the
fat
and
other
fat
based
products
such
as
butter
right
and
ghee
for
that
you
separate
fat
if
you
are
making
skim
milk.
So,
this
fat
you
can
use
for
butter
making
for
making
cream
etcetera
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:

So,
it
comes
to
the
level
of
standardization,
types
of
cream
there
are
different
types
of
creams
their
use
and
how
to
make
each
of
them
cream
is
a
rich
fat
based
dairy
product
that
you
obtain
by
skimming
milk
with
4%
fat
content.
Different
types
of
cream
depend
on
the
types
of
separation
or
cream
concentration
used
after
separating
the
cream
concentrate
it
to
10%
to
75%
fat
content
depending
on
your
intended
purpose.
On
the
average
most
cream
have
above
40%
fat
content.
Cream
is
a
rich
fat
based
dairy
product
that
you
obtained
skimming
milk
with
4%
fat
content
you
can
also
obtain
cream
from
milk
by
scalding
that
is
warming
the
milk
and
separating
the
fat
it
raises
to
the
top.
9
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:30)
Then
after
separation
cool
the
cream
to
below
5°C
to
avoid
spoilage
by
inherent
such
as
lipases
concentrating
the
cream
causes
rupturing
of
the
fat
globule
membrane
or
FGM
which
facilitates
an
easy
access
to
the
fat
nucleus.
So,
lipase
enzyme
will
be
there,
so
you
have
to
protect
against
that
in
addition
to
preventing
spoilage
cooling
also
slows
down
the
microbial
growth,
which
minimizes
spoilage
considerably
again
cooling
avoids
oiling
of
the
butter
fat
at
the
center
of
the
globules
are
liquid,
which
oozes
out
during
separation.

(Refer
Slide
Time:

Generally,
you
can
use
different
types
of
cream
for
the
following
purposes,
like
consumptions
depending
on
that
manufacturing
of
the
butter
and
ghee
you
can
use
the
fat
.Used
in
the
confectionary
industry
that
fat
standardizing
other
products
that
is
recombined
milk,
manufacturing
butter
oil
and
ice
cream
you
need
fat
or
cream,
categories
or
types
of
cream
there
are
different
types
which
you
are
said
earlier
also.
Fat
content
of
the
cream
that
determines
the
category
of
the
cream
this
includes
half
cream
minimum
fat
content
of
about
12%,
single
cream
minimum
fat
content
of
about
18%
the
then.
11
(Refer
Slide
Time:
22:42)
Whipped
cream
minimum
fat
content
around
35%,
then
double
cream
minimum
fat
content
of
around
48%,
plastic
or
clotted
cream
where
minimum
fat
content
is
around
55%,
already
earlier
also
you
had
given.
Now,
when
you
come
to
standardization
there
is
there
was
a
unique
system
developed
by
the
by
scientist
called
Pearson.
And
this
method
was
used
before
calculate
another
thing
schema
this
was
very
much
useful
in
the
in
the
in
the
dairy
industry,
because
they
did
not
have
calculators
like
today
you
just
go
back
to
3
decades
4
decades
or
2,
and
half
2
4
decades,
during
that
period
or
earlier
to
that
calculators
were
not
there.
So,
that
time
people
use
to
use
it
very
effectively
this
is
this
you
also
should
know
that
is
how
this
standardized,
so
this
call
Pearson
square
method
right.
So,
if
you
have
say
soybean
milk
having
45%
right,
and
your
corn
around
10%%,
cream
in
both
the
cases.
So,
45%
soybean
meal
with
45%,
cream
and
10%
corn
cream.
If
you
are
adding
then
how
much
you
need
to
add
you
know
that
your
finished
product
should
have
14%
right.
So,
45
minus
14
is
31
and
14
minus
10
is
4,
this
is
the
product
which
you
need
the
parts
of
that
soybean
milk
and
that
is
obtained
by
subtracting
diagonally
smallest
from
the
largest
this
is
simply
just
called
mod
right.
So,
the
difference
between
the
larger
one
minus
the
smaller
one
right
value,
value
wise.
12
So,
and
here
also
35
minus
14
that
is
31,
So
31%
of
corn
right
your
adding,
you
are
adding
getting
35
percent
by
35
plus
total
you
are
getting
right
35
percent
total
you
are
getting
and
you
can
say
that
four
parts
of
45
percent
soya
bean
cream
and
31
parts
of
10
percent
corn
cream,
if
you
are
adding
then
you
get
35
parts
of
14%
cream
of
the
from
the
two
right.
So,
to
use
Pearson’s
square
1
is
subtract
the
nutrient
requirement
middle
of
the
square
from
the
nutrient
concentration
on
the
left
of
the
square
in
the
feed
across
the
diagonal
top
left
minus
milk
that
is
the
bottom
right
and
bottom
left
minus
middle
that
is
the
top
right.
So,
repeat
this
for
both
feeds
right
this
is
the
unique
one
which
was
developed
by
Pearson
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:43)
Then
milk
standardization
is
important
in
the
dairy
industry
because
it
is
used
to
ensure
that
every
consumer
gets
milk
with
constant
fat
content
and
consistency
primarily
and
consistency
primarily
milk
may
be
separated
into
two
products,
that
is
cream
with
high
fat
content
about
40%
fat.
And
about
40%
fat
and
skimmed
milk
about
0.03%
fat,
this
can
be
0.32-0.5,
even
0.5%
fat
we
also
call
to
be
skimmed
milk
using
a
centrifugal
separator.
This
will
come
the
process
of
standardization
involves
reduction
of
fat
content
of
milk
from
the
natural
minimum
of
3.25%,
the
cream
extracted
from
the
standardization
process
facilitates
processing
of
other
dairy
products
such
as
ice
cream,
butter
and
ghee
right.
13
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:00)
So,
milk
standardization
can
take
two
form
that
is
either
partial
separation
or
mixing
of
skimmed
and
whole
milk
mass
balance
plays
a
key
role
in
successful
standardization
of
milk
right.
So,
we
can
we
can
do
a
small
example
that
that
if
you
take
2000
kg
of
milk
with
87%,
87.6%
water,
3.8%
fat,
3.2%,
4.6%
lactose
and
0.7%
ash
content
this
is
one
has
to
be
reduced
in
fat
content
from
3.8%,
which
was
there
to
2.5%
by
removal
of
cream
with
40%
fat
content
from
the
milk,
how
much
milk
will
have
to
be
removed
right.
So,
this
can
be
done
simply
by
the
by
mass
balance
that
TM
balance:2000=C+M
Where
C
stands
for
cream
and
M
stands
for
milk,
MF
balance:
2000×0.038=04XC+0.025×M.
14
(Refer
Slide
Time:
29:53)
So,
if
we
add
if
we
you
solve
this
then
we
get
2000×0.025
=
0.025×C+0.025×M
right
of
course,
C
for
cream
name
for
milk
which
you
have
already
said.
Solving
this
equation
will
get
C=69.3
kg
and
remaining
M=1930.7
kg
right.
This
is
one
example
and
another
example
let
us
do
very
quickly,
so
that
our
time
is
utilized.
If
3000
kg
of
same
milk
is
used
in
the
previous
example
is
separated
into
cream
with
45
percent
fats
and
skimmed
milk
without
with
0.05
percent
fat,
how
much
cream
and
skimmed
milk
are
expected
assuming
no
losses?
Again
total
milk
balance,
if
you
do
3000
was
C
plus
M
that
is
cream
plus
milk
FMB,
that
is
if
we
do
that
fat
balance
right
milk
fat
balance
that
is
3000
into
0.038
is
equals
to
0.45
C
plus
0.0005
S
right.
Now,
solving
the
equation
will
give
C
is
equals
to
250.3
kg
and
S
equals
to
2
point
2749.7
kg
right.
So,
like
that
we
can
do
by
simple
mass
balance
this
also
can
be
done
with
the
Pearson
square
method,
right
to
do
with
Pearson
square
method
you
will
get
the
same
right.
So,
let
us
stop
today
here
because
time
is
over
we
will
then
come
to
the
next
class
thank
you.
Thank
you.
