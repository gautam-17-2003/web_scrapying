Cheese
So,
in
our
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology;
today ,
we
shall
deal
with
the
cheese
right,
because
cheese
I,
as
I
told
you
earlier
that
we
will
deal
with,
one
two
very
popular
products.
How
it
is
manufactured
what
are
the
different,
processes
and
associated
things
as
far
we
can.
So,
today
we
shall
do
with
the
cheese,
right.
So,
cheese
this
is
a
fermented
product
that
is
coming
under
the
fermented
product.
So,
not
only
fermentation,
but
also
it
also
requires
primarily
of
course
fermentation,
but
it
also
requires
your
aging
and
other
things.
So,
those
things
will
and
its
definition
is
a
very
big
fundamental
one
that
is
a
big
definition
and
the
thing
which
came
up
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
making
cheese
is
a
dead
back
to
old
days
where
cheese
were
manufactured
not
like
that.
So,
accidentally
it
happened,
because
people
used
to
take
their
food
or
maybe
milk
and
other
things
in
the
earlier
days
you
didn’ t
have
any
transport.
So,
that
time
maybe
in
the
container
made
of
the
stomach
of
many
animals
typically ,
maybe
cow
and
others.
So,
in
that
accidentally
this
happened
and
from
there
subsequently
people
have
modified,
generated,
developed
and
now,
it
is
a
very
popular
all
over
the
world
product
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
this.
Now ,
today
we
are
in
the
51th
class
and
we
will
deal
with
cheese.Right.
If
you,
as
I
said
if
you
look
at
the
history ,
no
one
knows
who
first
made
cheese,
but
the
most
popular
story
is
that
an
Arab
put
milk
into
a
bag
made
from
a
sheep’ s
stomach
to
take
with
him
on
a
trip,
by
the
time
he
was
ready
for
a
drink,
the
rennet
from
the
sheep’ s
stomach,
along
with
the
warmth
and
gentle
agitation
had
turned
his
milk
into
a
type
of
product
known
as
cheese.
Subsequently ,
it
was
known
as
cheese.
So,
basically
you
see
this
rennet
that
is
the
one
which
is
primarily
from
the
stomach
of
the
animal
and
this
was
in
the
case
of
sheep
right,
because
as
I
said
for
transportation,
they
used
to
use
these
sheep’ s
or
maybe
camel
and
horse
and
the
others
so
but
the
container
was
made
from
the
stomach
of
the
sheep
which
contained
this
rennet.
Rennet
is
an
enzyme;
rennet
is
an
enzyme
available
in
the
stomach
of
the
animal
like
cow,
sheep’ s
all
these.
They
do
have
this
rennet
that
is
why
because,
subsequently
you
will
see
that
since
rennet
is
a
part
of
making
the
cheese
subsequently ,
people
have
changed
it
because
to
get
the
rennet
you
have
to
slaughter
the
young
cow
or
young
calf.
So,
that
became
a
problem,
because
to
get
the
rennet
if
you
have
to
slaughter
cow's
and
calf's
from
the
animal
source
then
the
animal
may,
I
mean
the
production
of
animal
is
not
to
that
extent
very
high.
So,
mismatch
was
there,
subsequently
people
have
made
it
their
norm
that,
this
rennet
has
to
be
substituted
with
some
other
things,
which
will
come
across
right
hopefully .
Now
let
us
look
into
that,
what
is
the
definition
of
rennet,
cheese.
By
definition
Cheese
is
said
like
that,
cheese
is
the
curd
or
substance
formed
by
the
coagulation
of
milk
of
certain
mammals
by
rennet
or
similar
enzymes
in
the
presence
of
lactic
acid
produced
by
added
or
adventitious
microor ganisms,
from
which
part
of
the
moisture
has
been
removed
by
cutting,
warming
and
or
pressing,
which
has
been
shaped
in
a
mould
and
then
ripened
by
holding
for
some
time
at
suitable
temperature
and
humidities.
So,
lot
many
things
we
have
said
right,
lot
many
things
we
have
said
by
definition
number
1;
it
is
made
from
the
rennet
and
also
could
be
from
it.
Adventurous
microor ganisms
which
produce
lactic
acid
and
then
these
can
be
the
product
which
we
are
getting,
then
with
that
coagulated
product
can
be
then
further
cut
and
warm
or
press
or
it
can
be
put
into
mould
then
ripen
and
then
it
is
made
to
the
product
called
cheese,
but
this
ripening
is
also
a
function
of
temperature
and
humidity
right.
So,
it
is
a
not
so
easy,
it
is
a
complex
process
by
which
this
cheese
is
done
right,
from
the
definition
you
can
understand
and
if
you
remember
that
earlier
in
our
country
as
of
now,
whatever
at
least
I
have
come
across
from
the
market.
Primarily .
this
cheese
is
available
from
Amul
primarily
and
many
others
could
be
there,
but
primarily ,
it
is
from
Amul
and
some
of
the
dairies.
But
they
are
not
in
our
country
so
much
popular
as
it
is
in
other
foreign
countries
particularly
those
countries,
which
are
cold
area
which
are
in
the
cold
region.
So,
there
it
is
more
because
of
course,
they
also
need
lot
of
fat
that
is
why
so,
cheese
when
they
need,
they
can
take
as
they
take
in
everything
cheese,
depending
on
the
liking
of
the
people
depending
on
the,
food
habit
of
the
people
so,
it
is.
But
in
our
country ,
it
is
also
getting
popularized
and
Amul
has
made
it
a
lot,
but
they
have
only
two
three
or
couple
of
varieties
right,
but
of
course,
they
are
also
getting
imported
and
if
you
go
to
any
big
malls
or
big
shopping
centres,
there
you
can
get
according
to
your
requirement.
But
the
primarily ,
what
we
have,
you
see
that
Amul,
they
have
cheese
slice
and
cheese
cube
right,
but
yeah,
if
you,
you
can
make
it
as
you
require
and
according
to
that
it
can
be
prepared
and
supplied
right.
So,
then
from
this
definition
let
us
go
into
this.
Unfortunately ,
I
cannot
make
it
bigger ,
because,
because
if
we
look
at
this,
you
see
that
the,
if
this
is
the
cheese;
so,
that
we
can
subdivide
into
soft
cheese,
then
semi
soft
or
semi
hard
cheese,
then
hard
or
processed
cheese,
then
very
hard
or
processed
cheese,
again
then
whey
cheese
or
it
may
be
processed
as
such
processed
cheese
right.
And
in
examples
we
have
given
that
for,
very
hard
pressed
cheese
now,
this
is
very
hard
pressed
cheese
we
can
name
that
one
is
Parmesan
and
in
way
we
can
say
it,
which
is
you
can
say
Ricotta
rather .
Then
in
processed
cheese
there
are
many
that
could
be
pasteurized
process
cheese
and
others
and
again
in
soft
variety ,
we
can
may
get
it
unripened
or
ripened
and
the
one
in
the
definition,
we
had
said
that
it
was
it
is
kept
under
certain
container
and
then,
it
is
kept
under
certain
temperature
and
humidity .
So,
during
that
time
this
process
is
known
as
ripening
right.
We
will
also
come
into
this.
So,
there
ripened
or
unripened
that
also
makes
a
division
and
if
it
is
a
low
fat
like
cottage
cheese
or
if
it
is
a
high
fat
for
example
creased
cream
cheese.
They
are
also
under
unripened
condition.
Then
for
ripened
one
we
can
have
it
bacterial
ripened.
For
example,
pickle
cheese
or
it
can
be
mold
ripen,
for
example,
we
can
call
it
Camembert
right.
So,
then
under
the
category
of
semi
or
hard
or
semi
solid
or
semi
soft,
whatever
you
call
it,
that
under
that
category ,
it
can
be
re
again
bacterial
ripened.
For
example,
Brick
or
Tilsit
or
this
is
mold
ripened
right,
not
mild
mold
ripened
and
that
can
be
again
internal
the,
that
it
is
it
can
be
Stilton
or
Roquefort
right.
This
generally ,
blue
cheese
known
as
blue
cheese
or
it
could
be
surface
line
ripened
by
bacteria
and
surface
microor ganism
for
example,
Limbur ger
right.
So,
under
the
hard
category ,
we
hard
pressed
category
again
it
could
be
bacterial
ripen.
For
example,
Cheddar
cheese,
Edam
cheese
or
Gouda
cheese
or
it
could
be
bacterial
ripen
that
was
close
texture
and
this
is
open
texture
for
example,
Swiss
cheese
or
Herrgard
right.
Now ,
out
of
these
cheese
there
are
many
which
are
famous
for
example,
that
Swiss
cheese
you
might
have
heard
it
right.
So,
it’s
good
that
we
could
make
it
a
bigger ,
we
could
make
it
bigger .
So,
this
is
the
one
which
we
are
looking
for
and
that,
this
yes
I
made
it
further
bigger .
So,
processed
cheese,
pasteurized
process
cheese,
which
is
Ricotta
then
very
hard
or
pressed
cheese
is
Parmesan,
hard
or
pressed
cheese
they
are
Cheddar ,
Edam,
Gouda
or
bacterial
ripened,
open
texture
that
was
close
texture
Swiss
or
Herrgard
or
here
also
we
get
that
Stilton,
Roquefort,
which
is
commonly
known
as
blue
cheese.So,
all
these
variety
there
are,
there
are
10,
more
than
2000
varieties
of
cheese
available
all
over
the
world.
So,
and
naming
is
typical;
naming
is
typical
in
the
sense
maybe
say
at
IIT
Kharagpur ,
if
you
prepare
one,
so
that
can
be
named
under
the
IIT
Kharagpur
again,
whether
it
is
bacterial
or
mold
or
ripened
or
unripened
or
soft
or
hard
depending
on
that.
So,
different
namings
are
there
and
that
is
why
the
varieties
are
around
2000
or
even
more
right.
It
is
widely
such
a
wide
variety ,
product
is
normally
not
with
any
other
things
right.
So
much
variations
around
2000
or
more
than
that,
this
varieties
are
there.
Composition,
if
we
look
at,
there
are
different
names
right,
different
names
like
Brick,
Camembert,
Cheddar ,
Cottage,
Cream,
Edam
then
Gorgonzola
or
Limbur ger
or
Gruyere,
then
Neufechatel
and
Parmesan,
Romano,
Roquefort
or
Sapsago,
Swiss,
Stilton
all
these
are
different
names
of
the
different
variety ,
but
you
see
the
moisture
content
it
is
varying
so
widely
the
smallest
or
lowest
one
could
be
17.0
and
the
highest
one
could
be
somewhere
69.8.
So,
within
this
such
a
wide
range,
this
moisture
content
varies
right
and,
fat
content
also
varies
very
widely
like
the
smallest
one,
could
be
1
percent
fat
and
the
and
the
highest
one
could
be
around
39.9
percent.
Yes,
this
is
the
highest
so
the
smallest
one
is
1
and
40
percent
fat
that
is
the
fat
variation.
So,
widely
1
to
40
it
is
not
so
wide
variation
then
protein
content,
it
is
relatively
less,
but
still
it
is
very
wide,
it
is
around,
the
lowest
one
is
around
say
19.3
and,
the
highest
one
is
say
49.4.
You
know ,
the
lowest
one
is
not
this
one,
the
lowest
one
is
14.5
and
not
19
14.5
and
the
highest
one
is
49.4
right.
So,
such
again
the
wide
variation
of
protein,
then
ash
and
mineral
content
or
salt
content,
if
we
look
into
that,
that
is
also
very
wide
and
this
range
between
1.9
and
say
11.9
such
a
wide
variation,
in
ash
or
mineral
content
1.9
and
say
12
to
11.9
is
roughly
12
right
or
1.9
can
also
be
made.
So,
2
to
12
percent
so,
much
wide
variation
of
the
minerals
right,
the
minerals
or
what
we
call
it
to
be
the
ash
content
and
such
a
wide
variation
of
the
composition
in
terms
of
moisture,
fat,
protein
and
minerals
is
only
possible
in
cheese.
You
will
not
see
in
many
other
commodities
such
wide
variation
in
composition
right,
but
the
product
is
same
cheese.
Obviously
their
appearance,
their
flavour ,
their
taste
everything
are
different
as
well
the
nutritional
value,
because
that
composition
will
also
indicate
their
nutritional
value.
So,
high
protein,
high
fat,
low
protein,
low
fat,
low
moisture,
high
moisture,
low
mineral,
high
mineral.
So,
any
combination
you
can
prepare
and
then
make
it
popular ,
that
is
why
as
I
said
all
over
the
world
more
than
2000
varieties
of
this
cheese
is
available,
more
than
2000
varieties
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
then,
the
there
are
two
soft
and
hard
varieties
which
are
which
we
will
talk
about
one
is
low
fat
unripened
cheese
and
the
other
is
cottage
cheese
right
low
fat
unripened
cheese
more
than
that
cottage
cheese
is
at
least
popular
in
our
place.
So,
we
can
harp
one
the
cottage
cheese,
the
cottage
cheese
usually
made
from
skim
milk
also
may
be
made
from
reconstituted
and
reconstituted
we
have
said
the
other
day
right
you
have
a
powdered
milk
and
that
is
reconstituted
and
concentrated
skim
milk
or
non
fat
dry
milk.
So,
anyone
could
be
used
for
cottage
cheese.
So,
when
cheese
contains
not
less
than
4
percent
fat
this
is
called
creamed
cottage
cheese.
So,
minimum
4
percent
you
if
you
have
seen
earlier
that
which
we
had
given
which
we
had
given
that
here
that
cottage
cheese
right
fat
content
is
around
1
percent
right.
So,
for
fat
content
is
around
one
percent
whereas,
moisture
is
around
70
percent
protein
is
around
say
24
percent
and
ash
content
is
around
2
percent
right.
So,
if
this
contains
your
4
percent
fat
then
it
is
called
typically
creamed
cottage
cheese
right
two
commercial
methods
are
there;
one
is
coagulation
by
acidity
developed
by
the
action
of
lactic
starter
or
coagulation
by
the
combined
actions
of
the
lactic
acid
starter
and
small
quantity
of
rennet
right.
So,
that
is
why
this
cottage
cheese
is
so,
popular
that
you
may
not
use
rennet
because
the
availability
of
rennet
maybe
a
problem.
So,
that
is
why
that
acid
formation
is
done
by
the
lactic
acid
bacteria
and
there
you
can
produce
your
desired
lactic
acid
with
the
known
variety
of
the
organism
and
you
can
you
can
eliminate
the
requirement
of
rennet.
So,
that
is
why
cottage
cheese
is
getting
popularity
in
our
country ,
it
is
becoming
easier
to
manufacture.
Then
the
process
says
that
first
you
pasteurize,
you
have
already
the
resource
of
the
milk.
So,
pasteurized
high
quality
of
skim
milk
at
62
to
63
degree
centigrade
for
30
minutes
or
72
degree
centigrade
for
15
seconds.
The
other
day
I
said
nowadays,
people
are
making
this
holding
time
typically
for
high
temperature
more
than
even
15
seconds
maybe,
couple
of
10
seconds
more
so,
that
there
is
no
chance
of
any
residual
organism,
which
can
cause
disease
that
is
disease
producing
organisms,
because
micro
you
remember
that
one
organism
that
was
micro
bacterium
tuberculosis.
So,
that
was
very
much
heat
resistant
and
for
that
reason
the,
holding
tank
could
be
a
little
bigger
or
longer
than
required
right.
So,
that
is
why
maybe
in
instead
of
15
seconds,
it
could
be
couple
of
10s
of
seconds
more,
maybe
25
35
seconds
ok.
Then
carefully
adjust
the;
carefully
adjust
the
milk
temperature
to
30
to
32
centigrade,
in
case
of
short
setting
and
22
degree
centigrade
in
case
of
long
setting
method.
Add
4
to
5
percent
in
short
setting
or
0.1
to
1
percent
in
long
setting
or
fresh
active
starter ,
mixed
lactic
acid
starter
or
lactic
streptococci
and
the
associated
Leuconostoc
species
are
also
used
and
you
can
add
rennet
in
case
of
lactic
acid
and
rennet
cheese,
where
combination
of
that
is,
we
were
using
at
the
rate
of
1
Millilitre
for
each
450
gram
of
milk.
So,
1
Millimetre
of
rennet
for
450
kg
of
milk,
diluted
to
40
times
it's
volume
with
pure
water
right.
Then
the
process
follows
like
this
that
covered
the
vat;
cover
the
vat
preferably
with
the
metal
cover
and
leave
it
undisturbed
until
milk
as
coagulated,
cut
the
curd
at
a
whey
acidity
of
0.5
to
0.55
percent
and
this
may
be
about
4.5
to
5
hours,
that
is
for
short
setting
or
12
to
14
hours,
that
is
for
long
setting
is
used,
after
the
starter
was
added,
the
time
is
measured.
Curd
knives
used
are
usually
one-fourth
or
three-eight
of
an
inch
in
size.
Then
15
minutes
after
cutting
the
curd
the
temperature
is
gradually
raised
up
to
43
to
52
degree
centigrade.
It
will
generally
require
from
45
minute
to
1
and
half
hours
that
is
for
short
setting
or
2
or
2
and
half
hours
for
long
setting
to
reach
this
temperature.
The
temperature
of
the
whey
is
increased
at
the
rate
of
2.5
to
4
degree
centigrade
during
15
minutes
of
interval;
15
minutes
interval
until
the
desired
cooking
temperature
has
been
reached.
Stirring
operation
should
be
done
with
utmost
care.
The
next
step
is
when
the
curd
particles
have
reached
the
desired
firmness,
drained
away
until
the
top
of
the
curd
begins
to
show .
The
curd
is
washed
2
to
3
times;
first
washing
with
cold
water
at
21
degree
centigrade
that
is
low
stirring
for
10
minutes,
second
washing
with
water
at
10
to
12
degree
centigrade
for
10
to
15
minutes
stirring
and
third
washing
with
water
at
4.5
degree
centigrade
and
generally ,
at
this
low
temperature
washing
could
be
avoided.
Then
after
this
you,
after
the
last
wash
water
has
been
removed
the
vat
of
curd
is
recovered
and
allowed
to
drain
thoroughly ,
the
curd
may
or
may
not
be
slated
or
this
is
the
perhaps,
mistake.
This
is
salted,
may
or
may
not
be
salted
right
and
salting
is
done
to
apply
using
not
more
than
1
percent
of
the
salt
of
the
weight
of
the
curd,
that
is
the
salt
which
can
be;
the
salted
or
unsalted
whatever
it
be,
is
held
at
to
1.5
degree
centigrade.
And
then
the
Cottage
cheese
be
creamed
if
so
desired
by
using
14
percent
fat
of
cream.
So,
that
the
content
is
not
less
than
4
percent
what
we
said
that
cream
cottage
right,
Cottage
cream
and
then
this
way
you
can
prepare
the
Cottage
cheese
it
is
very
easy
right.
Now ,
perhaps
we
are
running
out
of
time
in
this
class
next,
we
will
go
in
the
next
class
another
which
is
called
Cheddar
cheese.
Thank
you.
