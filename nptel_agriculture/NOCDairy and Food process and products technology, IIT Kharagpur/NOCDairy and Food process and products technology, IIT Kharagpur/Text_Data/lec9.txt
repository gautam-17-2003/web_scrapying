Quality
of
Food
(Contd.)
So,
we
continue
on
that
quality
aspect,
right.
Now ,
obviously ,
as
we
said
in
the
beginning
that
we
will
be
adhering
into
as
much,
but
may
not
be
possible
all
the
time
to
adhere
to
the
course
means
outline
which
was
given
right,
because
there
are
many
like
this
quality
which
is
a
very
important
aspect
on
food.
So,
how
could
we
minimize
it
as
much
as
information
we
can
disseminate
to
you
that
is
much
better
for
you.
So,
that
is
why
I
am
still
continuing
on
it.
May
be
I
do
not
know
if
I
am
not
able
to
cover
up
today
on
that
or
in
this
class
then
we
may
be
asking
for,
right.
So,
let
us
go.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:09)
What
is
that
on
the
other
part?
1
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:12)
Aroma
and
flavor
and
taste
which
you
were
saying,
right.
So,
aroma
is
an
odour
and
is
often
referred
to
as
a
smell
and
is
sensed
by
the
receptors
in
the
nose.
So,
as
you
know
we
this
is
called
olfactory
region,
which
we
have
this
nasal
and
mouth
cavity
all
put
together .
This
is
called
olfactory
region
where
you
have
lot
many
sensors
lot
many
sensors
which
can
sense
because
human
being
is
the
best
creation
of
nature
right
they
have
so
many
things
which
yet
to
be
copied,
or
yet
to
be
fabricated
equivalent
to
that.
But
we
know
that
in
how
many
numbers
of
rather
we
can
say.
You
can
definitely
differentiate
between
mango,
mango
aroma
which
is
coming
from
mango
or
maybe
coconut
oil
which
is
having
another
aroma
even
from
the
distance
you
can
differentiate
them,
so
right.
So,
it
is
sensed
by
the
receptors
in
the
nose
and
that
is
what
is
the
aroma.
And
taste
or
gustation
that
may
be
the
sense
that
may
be
the
sensation
of
saltiness
or
sweetness
or
sourness
or
bitterness
and
umami
of
the
food
material
and
that
comes
under
the
umbrella
of
the
taste,
right.
We
say
this
has
this
taste
right
whereas,
flavour
is
the
sense
of
taste
and
smell
both
in
combination,
right.
So,
it
both
in
combination
sense
of
taste
and
smell
that
comes
under
the
purview
of
flavour ,
right.
So,
if
you
say
aroma
we
also
can
differently
say
that
yes
the
flavour
of
that.
But
you
will
see
in
most
of
the
cases
we
use
both
for
all
both
the
purposes
when
saying
aroma
we
can
mean
that
flavour ,
when
saying
flavour
we
can
mean
the
aroma
that
is
the
general
connotation.
So,
aroma
and
flavour
normally
most
of
the
people
2
do
not
differentiate,
but
yes
the
aroma
is
through
the
nasal
part
and
this
flavour
is
combination
of
both
taste
that
is
mouth
organ
and
the
result
part
in
combination
right.
So,
if
you
look
the
other
we
said
the
other
the
other
class
that
texture.
The
texture
is
normally
analyzed
through
a
texture
profile
analysis
TPA,
right.
We
said
the
UTM,
universal
testing
machine,
so
this
universal
testing
machine
is
normally
different
in
different
bodies
are
different
manufacturers
are
made,
but
for
our
nowadays
science
has
become
so
progress
that
different
companies
are
making
for
this
texture
analyzers
right.
Many
many
companies
are
making
typically
for
food
texture
analyzer ,
because
other
textures
like
everybody
as
texture,
even
you
go
to
metallur gy
they
have
the
steel,
iron
these
that
so
many
textures
there
wherever
you
will
get
that
texture.
So,
textures
are
the
textile,
texture
is
one
of
a
vital
word.
So,
it
depend
where
the
application
in
food
it
is
altogether
a
different
umbrella
and
normally
we
set
texture
in
terms
of
texture
profile
analysis
and
in
that
this
force
versus
deformation
curve
right
that
gives
us
lot
of
input
lot
of
information
and
utilizing
that
information
we
can
define
texture
altogether
useful
for
food
material,
right.
So,
TPA
or
texture
is
measurement
of
texture
attributes
by
mimicking,
we
are
mimicking
the
act
of
the
chewing
this
I
said
that
we
chewing.
So,
this
chewing
we
are
mimicking
by
the
help
of
the
instrument
and
that
is
and
this
information
is
utilized
subsequently
for
different
terminologies
in
terms
of
texture.
The
probe
will
interact
with
the
food
two
times
right.
I
cannot
show
you
that
texture
profile
analyzer
here,
but
the
thing
is
that
if
this
base
right,
if
this
is
the
base
and
if
this
is
a
probe
and
on
that
base
if
this
is
a
food
material
kept
on
that,
right.
So,
this
probe
comes
here
and
touches
it
and
from
there
it
is
pressed
or
taken
out.
So,
this
is
done
twice,
right.
So,
two
times
that
is
being
done
and
then
change
of
force
and
time
change
of
force
and
time
will
be
recorded
and
from
the
force
time
curve
texture
attributes
of
this
sample
can
be
determined
or
calculated.
So,
this
that
probe
texture
analyzer
which
has
come
and
given
some
force
to
the
food
material
so
that
will
be
that
will
be
automatically
going
to
that
information
to
normally
to
some
computer ,
and
in
that
computer
there
is
also
nowadays
those
software’ s
are
available
which
will
analyze
that
data
and
give
you
the
result
in
terms
your
texture
analysis
in
terms
of
texture
profile
analysis,
right.
And
typically
a
curve
looks
like
that.
3(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:34)
Texture
profile
analyzer
curve
looks
typically
like
this
right,
and
this
is
through
an
instron
TPA.
So,
since
instron
is
again
one
universal
testing
machine,
instron
is
one
instrumental
or
one
company
which
makes
like
that
there
are
many .
But
principal
is
all
the
principal
is
are
same
maybe
they
are
their
software’ s
could
be
different,
but
by
principal
there
like
that.
So,
and
there
also
as
we
texture
many
and
many
others
do
come
in
that,
but
we
are
not
concerned
about
that
much
because
we
do
not
need
much
about
the
bending
exercise
forces
etcetera.
But
we
would
like
to
know
how
much
like
you
have
taken
peanut,
right.
You
have
taken
peanut
in
your
mouth
now
you
have
to
put
pressure
through
your
teeth
right,
how
much
teeth
pressure
is
given
that
you
are
you
are
mimicking
through
this
TPA
or
texture
profile
analysis,
right.
So,
if
you
look
at
this,
if
you
see
that
first
this
is
the
first
point
when
it
is
at
the
time
0
here
this
your
pro
thing
has
come
right
and
then,
it
is
so
sensitive
you
see
I
have
put
my
hand
here
and,
is
very
sensitive.
4
(Refer
Slide
Time:
09:58)
So,
from
there
this
pressure
is
going
up
right
and
then
after
this
first
deformation
this
has
come
out
right
and
it
is
called
the
first
bite
or
it
is
written
as
the
Fructurability
by
which
it
has
become
fracture,
right.
Then
it
has
come
to
this
part
this
is
called
the
again
this
is
the
first
bite
or
this
tells
about
the
hardness
right,
hardness
of
the
material
that
can
be
like
that.
Then
it
comes
back
to
0
and
then
it
pulls,
this
is
a
reverse
force
you
are
applying.
Here
you
are
the
direction
of
force
which
you
are
applying
here
it
is
the
reverse
right,
and
then
following
this,
this
again
goes
for
the
second
right
and
comes
like
that,
right.
Now ,
these
distances,
these
areas,
like
this,
these
areas,
this
distances
all
are
and
all
are
contributing
to
the
development
of
different
parameters
on
textures,
right.
So,
basically
TPA
looks
like
that
we
get
area
1,
area
2
and
area
3
right.
And
we
get
to
fix
here
one
and
here
another
and
we
get
another
small
peak
here
and
that
is
called
fracture
ability ,
right.
The
moment
when
the
fracture
comes
in
the
typical
product
right
and
that
is
the
fracture
ability .
How
much
hard
it
is
it
is
called
in
terms
of
hardness
how
much
hard
it
is
right,
how
much
pressure
you
have
to
put
that
is
the
hardness,
then
how
much
gumminess
chewiness
they
are
there.
So,
those
things
will
be
according
to
the
either
distance
of
this
distance
1,
distance
2
or
area
under
A1,
A2
and
A3
so
that
we
will
discuss,
right.
So,
if
you
look
at.
So,
among
the
attributes
that
can
be
determined
by
this
TPA
are
first
is
the
fracture
ability
right,
which
we
just
told
first
is
the
fracture
ability .
Now ,
Fructurability
we
mean
that
this
is
the
Fructurability
this
we
mean
that
the
force
needed
to
produce
the
first5
significant
fracture
during
the
first
bite,
right.
The
force
which
is
required
to
make
the
significant
fracture
in
the
product
during
the
first
bite
that
is
the
fracture
ability ,
right.
So,
quantity ,
quantify ,
you
can
quantity
you
are
able
to
quantify
right
you
are
now
able
to
quantify .
Then
hardness,
hardness
is
the
largest
force
produced
during
the
first
bite.
So,
largest
force
which
is
required
during
the
first
bite
can
be
said
as
the
hardness
of
the
material
right,
the
more
harder
the
more
this
will
go
right
and
then
fall.
If
it
is
less
hard
it
will
fall
like
that,
so
more
harder
this
will
be
more
this
height
or
this
height
will
be
accordingly ,
right.
So,
more
harder
means
more
force
you
are
required
to
put.
Then
cohesiveness
is
nothing,
but
the
ratio
of
area
under
the
positive
curve
between
the
first
and
second
bite,
that
is
area
under
2
by
area
under
1.
So,
this
is
the
TPA.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:51)
So,
this
was
area
under
curve
this
was
area
under
this
curve
area
1
right,
this
was
area
under
curve
2,
same
during
first
bite
same
during
the
second
bite,
right.
So,
this
area
A1
and
A2
this
ratio
that
will
tell
us
as
you
said
the
ah
parameter
which
we
just
said
that
we
will
be,
ok.
So,
this
was
cohesiveness.
6
The
ratio
of
area
A2
by
area
A1
right,
I
again
go
back
because
this
becoming
difficult
that
these
3
area
we
will
remember
A2,
this
A2
this
and
A3
this,
right.
So,
this
these
are
the
two
positive
area
that
is
why
in
definition
we
have
said
that
the
positive
area
ratio
of
area
under
the
positive
curve
between
the
first
and
second
bite
that
is
area
A2
by
A1
is
cohesiveness.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:38)
Others
we
can
say
adhesiveness
right.
Adhesiveness
work
needed
to
pull
out
the
probe
from
the
sample
after
the
first
bite.
So,
here
made
this,
right.
So,
the
whole
material
is
between
your
teeth
two
teeth,
right.
So,
it
is
stuck
like
that.
So,
after
that
when
you
are
releasing
right,
how
much
force
you
are
required
to
release
so,
that
when
you
are
releasing
that
will
dictate
the
adhesiveness
how
adhesive
it
is,
right.
So,
that
is
that
what
needed
to
pull
out
the
probe
from
the
sample
after
the
first
bite
that
is
by
area
3,
you
remember .
So,
this
was
that
the
lower
part
right,
this
lower
part
area
3
was,
ok.
So,
this
area
will
tell
you
that
how
adhesiveness
it
is.
Then
comes
springiness
right,
springiness
this
is
ratio
of
ratio.
So,
ratio
of
the
biting
distance
of
the
second
bite
with
the
first
bite
the
distance
2
by
distance
1,
and
again
I
go
back
to
that
if
possible
that,
this
is
that
this
is
the
first
bite.
So,
this
distance
again
this
distance
this
was
the
first
bite
this
distance
1,
distance
1
and
this
is
the
second
bite
because
it
started
from
here
for
second
bite,
right.
7
(Refer
Slide
Time:
18:20)
So,
this
the
two
distances
will
dictate,
and
this
was
area
3
which
were
used
for
cohesiveness,
right.
So,
we
have
also
seen
that
how
much
this
distance
this
distance
once
we
know
that
then
we
can
say
all
the
parameters,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
19:08)
So,
adhesiveness,
cohesiveness
is
done.
Then
springiness,
springiness
is
that
the
ratio
of
the
biting
distance
of
the
second
bite
to
that
of
the
first
bite,
right.
So,
that
is
distance
2
by
distance
1
right,
distance
2
was
this
with
the
second
bite
and
distance
1
was
this
for
the
first
8
bite
right,
this
was
that.
So,
this
was
d
distance
1
and
this
was
distance
2,
right.
So,
D2
by
D1
is
the
springiness.
Then
gumminess,
gumminess
is
the
product
of
hardness
and
cohesiveness.
And
then
chewiness
is
also
a
product
of
already
measured
that
is
gumminess
into
springiness
is
the
chewiness
right,
gumminess
into
springiness
is
the
chewiness.
So,
once
we
know
all
of
them
then
we
can
say
that
we
are
able
to
tell
the
texture
properly ,
right.
So,
again
I
repeat
one
is
fracturability ,
then
hardness,
then
cohesiveness,
and
then
adhesiveness,
or
springiness,
gumminess
and
chewiness,
all
these
we
obtain
from
the
texture
profile
analysis
or
TPA.
So,
you
see
you
are
able
to
measure,
absolutely
or
calculate,
absolutely
for
a
definite
food
material
what
should
be
the
quality
parameters
either
before
or
after
processing
as
and
when
you
required.
Obviously ,
this
will
be
you
will
be
implementing
it
whenever
you
are
referring.
So,
you
have
so
many
parameters
in
hand
to
tell
the
quality .
(Refer
Slide
Time:
21:42)
Then
it
comes
really
what
about
the
product
quality
in
terms
of
consumer
point
of
view
or
in
terms
of
retailer
point
of
view .
Consumer
wants
that
fresh
tasty,
variety
and
convenient
food.
Say,
if
you
ask
any
consumer
he
will
say
I
want
quality
in
terms
of
freshness
of
the
material
or
in
terms
of
the
taste
of
the
material,
variety
of
the
material
or
convenience,
how
convenient
it
is.
If
you
say
that
I
give
9
you
a
product
like
this
and
now
you
do
xyz
etcetera
steps
to
make
it
edible
for
you
obviously ,
the
consumer
will
check
no
may
or
may
not
be
right.
But
if
you
say
I
give
you
this
product
you
do
not
have
to
do
anything
to
take
home
and
open
your
covering
that
is
the
packaging
material
and
directly
consuming
they
like
you
like
the
most,
right.
So,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
consumer
he
is
liking
in
terms
of
quality
will
be
that
it
should
be
as
fresh
as
possible,
it
should
be
as
tasty
as
possible
or
you
should
have
various
type
of
variety
and
also
it
should
be
convenient
for
the
consumer .
That
is
the
consumer
point
of
view
quality
you
can
say.
But
the
people
who
will
be
call
retailers
selling
it
will
be
selling
it,
right
they
will
have
also
different
quality
parameters
like
they
will
say
availability ,
obviously ,
a
product
which
is
very
good,
but
not
available
so
that
they
do
not
want
because
there
to
sell
it.
People
will
ask,
consumer
will
ask
and
tell
them,
so
there
in
terms
of
quality
it
will
see
it
in
the
term
of
availability ,
then
accessibility ,
then
presentability ,
or
then
prolong
shelf
life
how
much
shelf
life
it
has,
and
also
the
conformance
that
how
good,
how
bad
it
is,
and
that
confirmation
they
want,
right.
That
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
retailer .
Manufacturers
will
tell
ok,
we
will
meet
the
requirement
of
the
whatever
consumer
wants
or
we
will
exceed
the
expectation
of
the
consumer
and
the
retailer
that
is
what
the
producer
or
the
manufacturer
will
target
and
tell
to
them
for
it
is
that
right.
But
to
the
scientist
as
we
have
define
is
the
quality
parameters,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:56)
10
Then
safety ,
how
we
can
sell
product
safety?
Consumer
will
tell
the
preservation
without
compromising
quality
it
can
be
done
is
the
safe,
safest
food.
In
terms
of
quality
effect
if
I
in
terms
of
quality ,
if
I
do
not
have
to
forgo
quality
if
I
do
not
have
to
compromise
with
quality ,
and
if
the
life
can
be
extended
to
any
desirable
time
then
my
safety
is
that,
my
safe
food
is
that.
But
retailer
will
say
retailer
means
who
is
who
is
selling
that
if
it
is
sustainable
preservation
over
an
expanded
the
distribution
network
right
obviously ,
product
could
be
product
could
be
manufactured
at
a
point
so
where,
product
could
be
manufactured
at
a
point
say
here
and
then
it
will
go
from
there
to
here
then
there
to
like
that.
So,
this
fellow
will
say
to
me
my
quality
is
should
be
sustainable
in
terms
of
preservation,
over
an
extended
distribution
network
right.
And
manufacture
will
say
yes
I
will
try,
we
will
try
to
exceed
the
expectation
of
both
consumer
and
the
retailer
and
that
can
be
safest
food
product,
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:29)
Then
we
come
of
course
again
it
is
another
thing,
today
we
have
come
almost
to
the
end
of
the
class
very
very
limited
time
is
available.
So,
before
going
into
that
emer ging
technology
I
feel
let
us
recapitulate
a
little
then
going
into
the
new
topic
that
is
the
emer ging
technology
which
will
take
at
least
one
period
class.
So,
if
you
look
at
then
because
again
as
I
said
that
this
is
a
very
important
material
which
we
are
dealt
with
today
that
this
texture
profile
analysis
or
quality
right,
quality
parameter .
This
11
quality
should
have
some
parameters
by
the
by
the
either
consumer
or
by
the
retailer
or
by
the
producer .
So,
in
terms
of
them,
there
should
be
some
quality
parameters,
but
when
as
a
scientist
you
are
asked
to
judge
a
food
material
in
terms
of
its
quality
then
you
should
have
defined
parameters
we
said
that
the
shape
size
and
color
of
this,
then
flavor ,
aroma,
they
are
then
we
also
said
texture,
then
we
also
said
may
be
viscosity ,
if
it
is
a
liquid
or
semi
liquid
food
and
some
other
parameters
like
how
long
it
can
be
extended
and
then
how
the
packaging
is
coming
in
right
because
packaging
is
indirect.
Why?
Because
packaging
may
help
to
extend
the
life
directly
or
indirectly ,
so
directly
in
the
sense
that
if
a
product
is
not
in
contact
with
the
environment
outside
that
will
save
the
product
inside
the
packaging
material
to
be
contaminated,
right.
So,
packaging
plays
an
important
role
there.
Like
that
whatever
you
have
discussed
today ,
so
fully
you
go
through
them
very
seriously
and
keep
the
quality
term
for
the
food
products
in
mind,
ok.
Thank
you.
