New
Technologies
in
Dairy
Industries
So,
in
this
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Products
Technology
class
this
is
lecture
number
50.
We
will
discuss
some
of
the
technologies
which
are
used
in
dairy
industries
of
course,
this
is
not
only
in
dairy
industry ,
but
also
in
processing
industries;
they
are
used.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
00:38)
And
this
new
technologies
are
coming
up
very
much
in
not
only
again
in
dairy
liquid
food
but,
obviously
in
liquid
food
it
is
more
important,
but
in
solid
also
some
of
them
are
utilized.
But
for
example,
membrane
you
have
to
have
with
liquid
food
only
right;
membrane
processing
and
membrane
separation
by
which
nowadays
you
get
in
every
house
this
water
filter
you
get
that
is
true
membrane
technologies.
And
in
our
institute
we
have
our
collogues
they
have
made
this
membrane
to
the
level
that
bacterial
filtration
is
also
possible
and
not
only
that
in
many
cases
people
are
using
for
removing
the
contaminates
like
arsenic
which
is
very
poisonous.
1
So,
this
is
a
very
useful
technology
that
membrane
technology
that
is
being
used.
So,
that
is
let
us
start
with
that
time
is
not
very
high
we
are
coming
very
closer
to
the
end.
So,
that
regularly
as
we
are
explaining
more
and
more
time
is
also
being
consumed,
but
yes
it
is
a
try
and
time
frame
plus
and
cannot
be
extended
beyond
the
60
lectures.
So,
we
have
to
finish
some
more
a
very
important
things
maybe
some
products
will
also
discuss
right.
May
be
like
to
very
two
important
one,
one
is
your
what
you
get
cheese
and
another
one
ice
cream.
This
two
products
also
we
can
discuss
maybe
and
then
we
may
have
sometime
to
discuss
about
the
general
that
control/modified
atmosphere
storage
or
packaging
that
also
we
can
and
maybe
for
this
kind
of
liquid
food
some
your
packaging
that
can
also
be
discussed
will
try
and
see
as
much
we
can
cover
up
ok.
So,
is
the
membrane
process
where
this
is
ability
of
semi
permeable
membrane
of
appropriate
physical
and
chemical
nature
to
discriminate
between
molecule
primarily
on
the
basis
of
this
size
to
a
lesser
extent
on
shape
and
chemical
composition.
What
membrane
technology
is
done,
say
this
is
one
we
have
a
membrane
right.
So,
it
will
have
very
fine
pores
very
very
fine
pores;
the
finer
the
pore
size
the
filtration
efficiency
or
rather
in
terms
of
quality
filtration
efficiency
is
so
high
even
to
the
tune
of
bacteria
who
is
who
are
maybe
less
than
microns.
So,
they
are
can
be
separated,
they
can
we
remove
there
also
used
for
separation
of
this.
So,
this
membrane
technology
it
is
a
semi
permeable
membrane;
semi-permeable
means
it
will
permit
only
one
right
and
rest
of
the
things
will
not
be
allowed
to
pass
on
right.
So,
that
is
what
is
primarily
this
membrane
technology .
Then
ultrafiltration
in
many
of
the
collages
this
ultrafiltration
is
also
available
right.
2(Refer
Slide
Time:
05:09)
And
this
is
also
a
membrane
that
allows
separation
of
smaller
molecular
weight
substances
ranging
from
10000
to
75000
daltons
Molecular
weight
right
that
molecular
substances
can
be
removed
with
opening
operating
pressures
ranging
between
10
to
200
psig
right.
This
ultrafiltration
can
be
utilized
for
separating
around
10000
to
75000
daltons
this
molecular
mass;
whose
that
is
the
mass
that
is
a
material
or
impurity
which
you
want
to
remove
and
that
ranges
between
10000
to
75000
dalton
molecular
size
or
weight
right.
Then
by
reverse
osmosis
right,
osmosis
is
as
I
said
that
household
this
filter
things
they
are
available
with
reverse
osmosis
right.
RO
and
this
RO
filters
are
available
very
much
popular
nowadays;
whose
where
this
membranes
are
characterized
by
molecular
weight
cutof f
of
nearly
100
daltons.
It
was
10000
to
75000
here
it
is
nearly
100
daltons
and
the
pressure
involved
is
around
5
to
10
times
greater
than
those
in
the
ultrafiltration,
here
it
was
10
to
200
psi.
So,
it
will
be
5
to
10
time
so,
around
50
to
2000
psi
it
is
pressure
is
applied
for
reverse
osmosis.
3
(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:29)
So,
this
data
are
very
important
for
you.
So,
that
10
to
75000,
10000
to
75000,
10
to
200
psi
this
is
the
size
where
the
molecular
weight
of
substances
which
are
removed
and
this
pressure
is
around
10
to
200
psi.
Whereas,
here
it
is
around
100
in
reverse
osmosis
it
is
around
100
and
5
to
10
times
greater
than
the
pressure
of
the
ultrafiltration.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
08:10)
Then
you
see
nanofiltration,
this
nano
word
now
it
is
utilized
in
many
many
cases.
Since,
it
has
come
let
me
I
just
cannot
hold
myself
whenever
new
thing
comes
at
least
make
it
little
4
open
to
you.
So,
that
understanding
in
a
bigger
sense
maybe
easier;
nano
filtration
nano
size
is
10.
So,
these
nano
is
utilize
nowadays
in
many
cases
right
in
even
in
packaging
industries
also,
this
nanoparticles
they
are
trying
to
mix
up
with
the
film.
So,
that
the
strength
of
the
film
becomes
more
as
well
the
all
properties
because
it
is
not
only
one
many
properties
also
can
also
be
not
only
affected,
but
also
be
improved
towards
your
requirement.
So,
this
nano
technology
is
coming
up
here
also
nano
filtration
that
is
you
want
to
filter
very
very
fine
one.
So,
nanofiltration
is
a
demineralization
process.
Acid
whey
can
be
partially
demineralized
about
40%
particularly
way
with
respect
to
the
movement
of
the
ions
or
this
monovalent
ions.
Monovalent
ions
are
also
separated
and
concentrated
simultaneously
to
approximately
around
25%
total
solids
using
the
nanofiltration
process.
It
separates
particles
with
molecular
weights
in
the
range
of
300
to
1000
daltons.
So,
this
300
to
1000
daltons
with
nanofiltration
it
can
be
separated
and
operating
pressure
requires
nearly
around
300
psig.
So,
high
pressure
you
need
for
this
nanofiltration
and
the
particles
which
you
were
separating
is
around
300
to
1000
daltons
right.
So,
this
is
another
technique
by
which
you
can
separate.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:09)
Then
microfiltration
right;
so,
from
nano
we
are
coming
to
micro,
micro
is
bigger
than
nano
much
bigger
right.
So,
microfiltration
is
another
technique
by
which
you
can
of
course,
from
the
word
itself
it
goes
that
the
size
will
be
much
bigger
than
the
nano.
5
So,
in
that
microfiltration
is
essentially
used
as
a
clarifying
process
to
remove
macromaterials
and
suspended
solids,
milk
fat
globules,
bacteria
and
colloidal
particles.
These
are
all
with
respect
to
nano/macro
right
though
micro,
but
with
respect
to
nano
they
are
macro
molecules.
For
example,
we
said
suspended
solids,
we
said
milk
fat,
we
said
milk
fat
globules,
we
said
bacteria
or
we
said
colloidal
particles;
all
of
them
can
be
removed
by
the
microfiltration.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
12:23)
Then
in
microfiltration
membranes
with
pore
size
ranging
between
0.1
to
10µm
0.1
to
10µm,
the
pore
size
of
the
pore
size
again
as
we
said
if
this
is
a
filtered
medium.
So,
these
are
the
pore
sizes
through
which
it
may
pass
right.
So,
between
0.1
to
10
micron
size
and
the
pressure
operating
pressure
ranges
between
1
to
25
psig
right
is
used.
The
most
significant
application
of
the
microfiltration
is
to
separate
the
bacteria
from
milk,
that
is
one
vital
that
bacteria
with
microfiltration
if
that
can
be
removed
from
milk
then
that
high
temperature
which
affects
the
quality
of
milk
cannot
be
required
or
is
minimum
can
be
minimized
right.
So,
this
is
another
technique
by
which
you
can
remove
the
even
the
bacteria
from
the
milk.
They
are
come
to
some
other
techniques
like
ohmic
heating
right.
6
(Refer
Slide
Time:
13:47)
So,
we
have
had
the
ohms
law.
So,
from
there
we
know
rather
why
it
should
not
say
we
have
heard
we
know
ohms
law,
from
there
this
ohmic
heating
has
come
up.
This
is
what
is
also
called
the
electric
resistance
heating.
So,
depending
on
because
we
know
that
the
resistances
of
the
electrical
conductors
are
expressed
in
terms
of
its
ohm.
This
has
so,
much
ohm
10
ohm,
14
ohm,
15
ohm
or
20
like
that
depending
on
the
on
the
product,
depending
around
the
material
this
we
say
as
the
resistance
of
that.
So,
resistance
of
the
material
there
is
a
primary
or
electrical
resistance
of
the
primary
mechanism
by
which
this
ohmic
heating
is
bring
kept
introduced
right.
7
(Refer
Slide
Time:
14:52)
So,
ohmic
heating
also
called
electric
resistance
heating,
is
a
direct
heating
method
that
uses
food
itself
as
a
conductor
of
electricity
that
is
taken
from
the
mains.
The
most
important
benefit
of
ohmic
heating
is
that
heating
is
very
rapid
and
uniform
that
is
another
thing
right.
Say
you
have
pipe
like
this
and
through
which
milk
is
going
and
this
is
side
is
being
heated
by
steam,
this
side
is
heated
by
steam
right.
So,
it
is
all
like
that
the
milk
which
are
towards
the
pipe
side
they
will
be
heated
more
than
the
interior .So,
the
non
uniform
heating
may
arise.
Whereas,
in
this
case
this
heating
is
very
very
uniform
because
you
are
using
the
food
product
as
your
resistance
material,
you
are
passing
the
electricity
through
that
and
that
is
causing
the
product
to
be
heated
up.
8
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:13)
So,
uniform
heating
is
being
made
right
and
rapid
and
inform
meeting
is
being
made
that
is
the
primary
key
of
the
success
of
this
you
need.
The
process
is
ideal
for
shear
sensitive
products
right.
So,
those
which
are
which
are
shear
sensitive
those
products
can
be
very
effectively
very
heated
by
this
ohmic
heating
method.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
16:45)
Then
microwave
heating,
in
many
cases
in
nowadays
microwave
have
has
become
one
of
the
household
commodity
by
which
you
utilized
now
and
then.
In
my
most
of
the
houses
I
am
9
not
saying
in
terms
of
villages,
villages
may
not
be
is
this
aspirated
into
that
level;
But
definitely
in
the
biggest
cities
or
in
metros
this
is
very
very
useful
nowadays
and
people
are
using.
So,
in
that
microbe
heating
what
for
primarily
is
being
done
this
is
what.
So,
microwaves
are
being
passed
and
then
depending
on
the
polarity
and
there
the
polarity
of
the
material
which
bring
heated
is
primary .
So,
that
is
why
non-polar
systems
are
not
being
heated
or
not
being
used
right,
but
it
has
to
be
a
polar
where
like
a
water
right.
So,
that
becomes
heated
up
and
then
that
because
of
its
movement
it
gets
heated
up
and
raises
the
temperature
and
does
the
performance
right.
So
microwave,
are
form
of
electromagnetic
radiation
characterized
by
the
wavelength
and
frequency .
Microwaves
used
in
the
food
industry
for
heating
are
ISM
that
is
industrial,
scientific
and
medical
frequencies
which
are
around
2450
to
or
900
mega
hertz
right,
corresponding
to
12
or
34
centimeter
in
wave
length,
12
or
34
centimeter
in
wave
length
In
this
frequency
range
the
dielectric
heating
mechanism
dominates
up
to
moderated
temperatures.
Polar
molecules,
the
dominant
water
try
to
align
themselves
with
the
rapidly
changing
direction
of
the
electric
field.
The
energy
to
achieve
this
alignment
is
taken
from
the
electric
field.
When
the
field
changes
direction
the
molecule
“relaxes”
and
energy
previously
observed
is
dissipated
into
the
surroundings,
that
is
directly ,
inside
the
food.
This
means
that
the
water
content
of
the
food
is
an
important
factor
in
the
microwave
heating
performance
of
the
foods
right.
So,
depending
on
that
is
why
any
dry
product
where
moisture
is
not
there,
you
cannot
heat
through
microwave
because
that
water
that
acts
as
the
heating
medium
right.
So,
the
polarity
of
the
water
that
makes
the
heating.
So,
unless
you
have
been
moisture
then
you
cannot
heat.
So,
this
is
one
which
has
to
be
kept
in
mind.
10(Refer
Slide
Time:
20:39)
So,
after
the
microwave
heating;
there
are
high
hydrostatic
pressure
processing
or
HPP.
Again
HPP,
since
it
has
come
up
high
pressure
processing;
high
hydrostatic
pressure
processing
or
HPP
which
we
come
across,
let
me
also
tell
about
this
that
though,
throughout
the
world
this
technology
people
are
trying;
high
pressure
technology
I
am
not
against
it,
but
only
the
thing
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
commercialize
it
because
the
primary
is
not
in
terms
of
quality
or
in
terms
of
the
process.
It
is
primarily
the
price
which
is
the
drawback
of
the
system
and
may
not
be
feasible
for
commercialization
right.
But
of
course,
we
must
know
the
process
that
is
why
I
have
brought
it
into
this
that
high
pressure
technology
or
hydrostatic
pressure
processing
is
that
the
application
of
hydrostatic
pressure
for
food
results
in
instantaneous
and
uniform
transmission
of
the
pressure
throughout
the
product
independent
of
the
product
volume;
irrespective
of
the
volume
or
it
is
irrespective
of
the
size
right.
So,
it
is
hydrostatic
pressure
which
is
in
affecting
the
food
material
like
this
is
generally
used
for
inactivation
of
the
microor ganisms
right
and
without
the
heat
treatment.
So,
it
is
the
pressure
treatment
which
you
are
making.
So,
it
is
not
the
heat
which
is
coming
across
for
which
the
quality
is
not
getting
affected
right.
The
hydrostatic
treatment
is
unique
in
the
effects
do
not
follow
a
concentration
gradient
nor
do
they
change
as
function
of
time.
Other
advantages
include
that
the
substance
of
chemical
11
additives
and
operation
at
low
or
ambient
temperature
so,
that
food
is
essentially
raw.
Liquid
foods
can
be
pumped
to
treatment
pressures
held
and
then
decompressed
aseptically
for
filling
as
with
other
aseptic
processes.
Pressures
of
650
megapascals
650
megapascals
can
reduce
the
viable
numbers
of
microbes
right.
So,
primarily
this
is
for
deactivation
of
the
microor ganisms
and
you
see
the
pressure
range
is
around
650Mpa
right
650Mpa,
We
know
one
atmosphere
is
101.321kPa
right.
So,
that
is
so,
many
times
then
the
atmospheric
pressure.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:40)
Then
pulsed
electric
field
another
very
new
one
which
is
coming
up;
High-intensity
pulsed
electric
pulse,
pulse
means
whenever
you
are
giving
little
then
stop,
a
little
then
stop
like
this
is
called
pulse.
This
way
it
goes
right
like
our
body
pulse
you
will
not
get
a
continuous
right
it
gives
pick
and
then
this
and
the
pick
and
then
this
right.
So,
like
that
it
is
so,
that
why
it
is
called
pulse.
So,
pulse
electric
field
is
like
this.
12
(Refer
Slide
Time:
25:20)
High-intensity
pulse
electric
field
processing
in
bulks
the
application
of
pulse
of
high
voltage
typically
from
20
to
80
kvol/cm,
20
to
80
kvol/cm
to
foods
placed
between
two
electrodes.
Pulsed
electric
field
treatment
is
conducted
at
ambient
or
sub
ambient,
or
significantly
above
ambient
temperatures
for
less
than
1
second,
it
is
very
short
time;
as
a
result
of
which
the
energy
loss
due
to
heating
up
foods
is
minimized.
Pulsed
electric
field
technology
is
considered
superior
to
traditional
heat
treatment
of
foods
because
it
maintains
food
quality
by
avoiding
or
greatly
reducing
detrimental
changes
to
the
sensory
and
physical
properties
of
food
that
is
another
one
which
is
very
very
important
right.
13
(Refer
Slide
Time:
26:38)
Then
osmotic
dehydration
right
of
course,
we
know
osmosis
right.
Osmosis
is
also
again
a
semi
permeable
membrane
technology
right
and
this
is
due
to
the
concentration
difference
one
is
high
concentrated,
another
is
less
concentrated
depending
on
that
the
movement
of
the
liquid
is
from
one
side
to
the
other
side.
So,
that
technology
is
being
used
here
right.
So,
osmotic
dehydration
and
in
many
cases
this
concentration
this
is
dehydration
that
is
you
are
removing
moisture
from
the
food
material
you
are
removing
moisture.
So,
many
cases
this
is
done
right
and
in
that
what
we
can
say
is
that
the
concentration
of
food
products
by
means
of
product
immersion
in
a
hypertonic
solution
is
known
as
osmatic
dehydration.
And
osmatic
dehydration
consume
less
energy
compare
to
air
drying
and
freeze
drying
because
water
removal
occurs
without
a
phase
change.
There
is
no
phase
change
because
you
have
a
membrane
and
this
water
is
moving
from
one
side
to
the
other
side
right.
So,
heat
damage
to
the
food
product
is
minimum
in
case
of
osmotic
dehydration
as
the
product
is
not
subjected
to
high
temperature
for
extended
periods.
Successful
attempts
have
been
made
to
dehydrate
traditional
Indian
dairy
products
such
as
malai,
rasogolla
and
paneer
using
osmotic
dehydration
technology
right.
So,
osmotic
process
is
a
very
very
helpful
and
useful
process
for
renewal
or
concentrating
the
food
products
right.
14
(Refer
Slide
Time:
28:58)
Then
hurdle
technology ,
this
hurdle
technology
is
of
course,
another
one
that
is
where
the
combination.
Hurdle
technology
is
the
concept
in
which
three
or
more
preservation
parameters
that
is
hurdles
are
employed
in
suitable
combination
and
every
hurdle
is
used
to
at
optimum
level
so,
that
damage
to
the
overall
quality
of
food
is
kept
minimum.
Hurdle
technology
has
been
tried
for
preservation
of
several
Indian
dairy
products
such
as
milk
cake
paneer
and
paneer
curry
right.
So,
these
hurdle
technology
more
than
three
or
three
parameters
then
the
hurdles
are
employed
right.
Maybe
pressure,
temperature
and
some
other
maybe
concentration
like
that
so,
it
is
a
combination
technology .
It
is
a
combination
technology
where
more
than
one
parameters
are
controlled.
So,
that
type
of
thing
where
combination
technologies
are
where
temperature
high
is
not
possible.
So,
use
a
little
pressure,
use
some
concentration
difference.
So,
all
these
put
together
you
are
crossing
the
hurdle
so,
by
that
you
are
processing.
This
is
a
very
good
concept
because
if
you
see
like
walking
through
narrow
space
if
you
see
that
this
road
is
not
good.
So,
you
can
use
a
little
for
that
and
change
to
another
so
like
that.
So,
it
is
combination
where
according
to
your
requirement,
according
to
your
for
the
usability
you
are
utilizing
it
right.
15
(Refer
Slide
Time:
31:24)
Then
the
last
one
is
biopreservation,
by
which
you
are
already
done
in
many
cases.
The
biopreservation
refers
to
the
extended
storage
life
and
enhanced
safety
of
foods
using
their
natural
or
controlled
microflora
and
or
their
antimicrobial
products;
The
diverse
group
of
lactic
acid
bacteria
synthesis
a
variety
of
inhibitory
substances
such
as
organic
acids,
carbon
dioxide,
hydrogen
peroxide,
diacetyl,
bacteriocin,
etcetera.
So,
by
the
organisms
you
are
you
are
creating
many
many
substances
one
or
in
many
combination
which
are
acting
against
the
organisms;
for
example,
the
word
which
you
said
hydrogen
peroxide.
Hydrogen
peroxide
is
very
anti-microbial
right,
so
which
prevent
the
development
of
undesirable
bacteria.
So,
these
are
some
of
the
techniques
which
recently
have
come
up
and
they
are
not
only
used
in
dairy ,
but
also
are
used
in
many
other
food
products
right.
So,
with
this
let
us
complete
today .
Thank
you.
