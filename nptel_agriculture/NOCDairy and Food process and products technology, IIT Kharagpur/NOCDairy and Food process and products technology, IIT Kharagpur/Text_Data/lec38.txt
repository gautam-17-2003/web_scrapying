Extrinsic
Factors
for
Micr obial
Growth
So,
for
the
extrinsic
factors
which
we
said
the
other
the
intrinsic
factor
in
detail
we
have
discussed
for
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms.
So,
in
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology
in
our
this
lecture
number
38
we
discuss
on
the
extrinsic
factors
for
the
growth
of
the
microbes,
right.
So,
then
what
are
those
extrinsic
factors
which
control
or
which
moderate
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms,
right?
So,
that
we
can
say
that
the
condition
of
the
storage
of
food
lar gely
dictates
the
extent
of
microbial
growth.
So,
out
of
extrinsic
factor
one
primary
one
is
the
condition
under
which
you
are
keeping
your
food
material,
right.
So,
you
will
see
that
if
you
keep
a
food
in
a
good
condition
it
may
last
for
sometime
whereas,
that
food
if
it
is
surrounded
with
lot
of
lot
of
kachra
what
we
call
lot
of
lot
of
other
things
which
are
bad
environment
is
bad
so,
there
may
be
a
cross
contamination
and
the
food
may
spoil
very
easily .
So,
the
condition
where
you
are
preserving
where
you
are
storing
your
food
material
that
is
one
of
the
primary
and
in
this
regard
many
a
times
I
have
given
example
that
your
mummy
at
home
you
will
learn
that
your
mummy
or
seniors
they
always
tell
that
you
keep
anything
if
it
is
in
a
container
that
closely
tighten
that
stopper
or
lid
or
whatever ,
right.
So,
that
is
one
of
the
reason
that
will
make
your
storage
condition
dif ferent,
right.
So,
storage
condition
primarily
this
is
one
example,
lot
many
are
there
examples
are
also
there
explanations
are
also
there,
but
for
easy
understanding
I
gave
this,
right.
So,
the
lar gely
the
environmental
condition
or
storage
condition
is
dictating
the
microbial
growth,
right.
Microbes
multiply
rapidly
in
warm
oxygen
rich
moist
warm
oxygen
rich
and
moist
environment,
right.
So,
again
I
give
the
example
in
the
previous
class
I
had
given
you
that
nuts
which
are
being
sold
in
the
trains
and
other
at
local
places,
right
and
if
the
packaging
is
not
good
maybe
some
leakage
or
other
things
are
there.
And
if,
during
rain
rainy
season
where
the
outside
high
humidity
is
very
high
so
that
time
easily
it
can
migrate
into
that
and
that
may
cause
you
fungal
growth
very
easily ,
right.
So,
there
you
will
see
maybe
to
yesterday
you
brought
and
the
next
day
it
got
the
rotten
or
some
fungal
infection
was
there
which
may
be
visible
whereas,
during
winter
where
your
this
thing
was
so
low
humidity ,
was
so
low
that
the
even
though
the
it
was
there
is
some
puncture
in
the
container
or
in
the
packet
then
also
nothing
happen.
So,
environmental
condition
that
is
that
condition
where
you
are
keeping,
preserving
your
material
lar gely
it
will
dictate
the
extent
to
which
microbes
can
grow
or
microbes
can
invade
and
then
multiply ,
right.
So,
microbes
multiply
rapidly
in
warm,
oxygen-rich
then
moist
environment
all
these
three
factors
externally
it
helps
to
grow
oxygen-rich.
If
it
is
that
is
why
at
high
altitude
it
is
not
only
warm
there
you
are
not
getting
I
am
very
high
altitude
suppose
people
who
are
in
Kashmir
or
Ladakh
or
this
side
some
high
altitude,
right.
So,
those
places
other
than
temperature
low
temperature
there
they
oxygen
availabilities
also
low .
If
you
go
to
Ladakh
and
other
places
you
will
see
that
you
from
where
you
are
going
from
the
plane
level
you
will
feel
very
much
and
comfortable
for
many
many
days
or
couple
of
days
at
least
to
start
with
because
there
oxygen
is
low
availability
is
low .
So,
normal
growth
of
the
or ganisms
is
af fected,
right.
So,
oxygen
if
it
is
plenty
available
that
helps
the
or ganisms
to
grow ,
if
it
is
warm
that
helps
the
or ganisms
to
grow
and
if
that
is
why
I
give
the
example
of
winter
and
summer
or
rainy
seasons,
right.
And
also
the
moisture
level
in
the
environment
that
is
dictated
by
the
relative
humidity
number ,
right.
Sometime
in
rainy
season
it
may
be
90
–
95
percent
moisture
whereas,
sometime
in
this
cold
condition
winter
season
it
maybe
40
–
50
percent
moisture,
right.
So,
these
af fect
greatly
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms
so,
and
all
of
them
consisting
the
extrinsic
factors,
right.
So,
they
are
storagetemperature,
atmospheric
condition
and,
storage
temperature
storage
temperature
all
these
af fect
the
growth
of
the
or ganisms.
Then,
rate
of
microbial
growth
is
controlled
by
storage
temperature;
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
that.
A vailability
of
water
below
freezing
point
is
significantly
decreased,
right.
If
you
if
you
if
you
freeze
a
food
material
if
you
freeze
a
food
material
so,
that
is
below
its
freezing
point
then
you
will
see
that
water
which
was
in
the
food
material
is
no
longer
water ,
it
is
converted
into
ice.
So,
now ,
this
ice
is
not
suitable
for
the
or ganism
to
grow .
So,
availability
of
moisture
by
freezing
you
have
reduced,
you
have
separated,
now
it
will
not
grow .
So,
one
that
is
why
one
of
the
primary
method
of
preservation
is
freezing
one
such
keeping
the
food
material
in
intact.
So,
I
am
not
going
into
that
detail
then
we
are
stuck
up,
right
so
that
availability
of
the
water
in
the
food
material
that
is
controlled
by
the
state
of
the
water .
So,
if
it
is
in
the
frozen
condition
then
availability
is
not
there
or
minimum,
also
chances
of
or ganisms
to
invade
or
grow
is
much
lower ,
right.
Crystallization
of
water
makes
it
unavailable
halting
microbial
growth.
Enzymatic
action
at
low
temperature
above
freezing
point
is
very
slow
or
non-existent,
very
close
to
0
degree.
The
enzymatic
actions
are
also
minimized
right
in
cases
it
may
be
eliminated,
in
cases
it
may
be
minimized
depending
on
the
enzyme.
So,
we
just
cannot
be
said
in
one
word
that
it
is
eliminated
in
cases
some
enzymes
may
grow
at
around
0
degree
or
some
enzymes
do
not
grow
or
their
activity
is
nullified
at
that
temperature.
So,
it
is
either
eliminated
or
nullified
or
minimized
at
around
0,
that
is
the
just
above
the
freezing
point.
This
results
in
inhibiting
the
growth
of
the
microbes
to
a
great
extent.
So,
other
that
a
none
other
extrinsic
factors
are
that
atmosphere,
that
is,
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
surrounding.
Presence
or
absence
of
oxygen
af fects
type
of
microbial
population
greatly .
Presence
or
absence
of
oxygen
af fects
the
type
of
microbial
population
greatly .
Obligate
from
the
word
obligatory
this
word
is
very
close
obligate,
right.
So,
obligate
aerobes
cannot
grow
under
anaerobic
conditions.
So,
for
obligate
aerobes
you
need
to
have
oxygen.
If
it
is
under
anaerobic
condition
that
is
if
it
is
under
carbon
dioxide
condition
or
maybe
under
nitrogen
condition
right
then
the
anaerobe
this
aerobes
obligates
aerobes
cannot
grow ,
right.
So,
some
or ganisms
require
very
very
much
oxygen
to
grow .
Similarly ,
some
or ganisms
are
oxygen
is
detrimental
to
them,
they
don’ t
grow
and
if
non
oxygen
non
availability
of
oxygen
or
no
oxygen
or
minimum
oxygen
is
there,
then
some
or ganisms
to
grow
do
grow
rather
and
they
are
called
anaerobics
anaerobes,
right.
So,
obligate
anaerobes
will
grow
in
anaerobic
conditions
where
the
oxygen
is
not
there,
but
the
carbon
dioxide
or
nitrogen
other
than
oxygen,
oxygen
is
not
there
that
is
anaerobic
right.
This
includes
certain
food
borne
pathogens
right
certain
food
borne
pathogens
they
some
of
them
could
be
under
aerobic
conditions,
some
of
them
could
be
under
anaerobic
conditions
the
pathogens
depending
on
what
you
are
handling
with
or
what
you
are
referring
too.
So,
we
have
both
liking
oxygen,
disliking
oxygen
with
oxygen
without
oxygen
depending
on
what
is
the
environment,
what
is
the
atmosphere
that
whether
aerobic
or
aerobes
or
anaerobes
will
grow
that
will
depend,
right.
So,
next
we
go
to
milk
and
milk
products
spoilage,
right.
So,
milk
and
milk
products
spoilage
if
we
look
at
then
we
see
that
milk
is
an
unique
flavor
and
texture
material
of
the
product
and
rejected
if
there
is
of f
flavor
in
the
milk.
Y ou
never
like
to
drink
milk
if
there
is
of f
flavor .
The
moment
you
take
it
before
your
nose
or
mouth
if
there
is
some
of f
flavor
is
coming,
obviously ,
then
you
will
throw
it,
right.
So,
generally
it
is
in
good
flavor
or
liked
by
people
so,
that
is
normal.
So,
if
of f
flavor
is
developed
you
would
not
like,
right.
Spoilage
occur
by
my
biochemical
reactions
of
contaminating
bacteria
which
is
initiated
after
milking.
So,
there
are
many
ways
by
which
it
can
be
contaminated
and
these
contaminated
bacteria
or
or ganisms
spoil
the
milk,
right
and
then
it
produces
the
of f
flavor
and
which
is
not
desirable
and
that
is
why
if
the
of f
flavor
is
developed
you
throw
it,
right,
you
don’ t
drink,
ok.
What
are
those?
Manifestations
of
spoilage
are
by
lactic
acid
producing
bacteria
or
by
causing
souring
by
proteolysis
that
is
by
degrading
protein
lipolysis
that
is
by
the
lipid
degradation
or
hydrolysis
of
lipid
or
degradation
of
lipid
or
sweet
curdling,
right.
So,
there
could
be
curdling
that
is
the
casein
that
protein
may
come
out
because
of
the
acidity ,
right.
So,
these
are
some
of
the
manifestations
of
this
spoilage
in
milk
that
lactic
acid
producing
bacteria
causing
sour
or
it
may
be
not
only
milk,
but
milk
products
also
give
example
in
deep
summer
now
summer
is
there.
So,
in
deep
summer
if
you
go
to
some
sweet
or
confectionery
shop
and
if
by
chance
they
have
no
refrigerator
and
if
you
buy
some
say
rasogolla
you
more
in
many
cases
if
it
is
prepared
day
before
or
one
day
before,
then
next
day
when
you
are
consuming
you
feel
it
be
sour
may
not
be
it
is
so
bad
that
you
are
throwing
out,
but
you
felt
the
sour
test
and
that
time
you
complain
to
the
owner
that
what
kind
of
material
you
have
given
and
primary
result
is
this
souring
is
for
the
acid
producing
bacteria,
right.
So,
that
is
one;
second
could
be
of f
flavor
may
be
developed
by
the
hydrolysis
or
degradation
of
protein
or
of f
flavour
developed
due
to
hydrolysis
or
degradation
of
lipid,
right
or
could
be
the
protein
has
that
has
come
out
that
is
casein
that
has
entirely
come
out
that
is
called
curdling.
So,
these
are
the
some
of
the
manifestations
by
which
we
say
that
milk
has
spoiled,
right.
Now ,
the
spoilage
process
is
like
this
that
during
spoilage
fermentation
of
milk
that
is
that
is
initiated
by
microbes
if
it
is
normal
fermentation
then
it
could
be
to
the
extent
of
curdling,
if
it
is
abnormal
fermentation
then
it
could
be
it
could
cause
or
it
could
produce
gas
gaseous
or
ropiness
or
gassiness;
gassiness
gas
maybe
produced
or
some
rope
like
structures
may
be
there
in
the
in
the
in
the
product
say
it
could
be
milk
or
milk
product
rope
like
structures
are
there,
right.
Then
could
be
some
proteolysis
that
is
protein
degradation
or
could
be
some
sour
curdling
or
sweet
curdling
and
also
by
lipolysis.
So,
one
by
normal
fermentation,
that
is,
curdling
another
by
abnormal
fermentation
causing
gasification
or
gassiness,
ropiness
or
proteolysis,
lipolysis.
So,
it
curdling
all
this
may
happen
there
could
be
mixed
fermentation
that
is
two
or
more
fermentations
occur
simultaneously .
For
example,
acid
forming
bacteria
that
is
acid
being
produced
or
and
gas
is
also
being
produced
and
this
is
done
simultaneously ,
maybe
some
coli
forming
bacteria,
right.
So,
I
coli
forming
bacteria
they
are
responsible
for
doing
both,
that
is,
it
is
producing
some
gaseous
as
well
it
is
producing
some
your
acid,
right.
So,
both
acid
and
gaseous
are
being
produced
by
coli
form,
right;
then
associative
action
that
is
that
combined
action
that
is
two
or
more
species
or
genera
or
dif ferent
genera,
right
that
may
cause
desirable
or
undesirable
changes
right.
So,
combined
action
means
two
types
of
or ganisms
may
do
simultaneously ,
right;
genera
means
family
is
dif ferent
from
two
family .
So,
they
can
invade
and
cause
the
degradation,
right.
And,
as
we
said
and
some
case
l
l
b
that
l
l
b
is
producing
the
acid
which
is
not
allowing
others
to
grow .
So,
dif ferent
situations
are
arising
and
we
are
handling
them,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
that
changes
not
possible
by
single
microbe
are
three
types
of
that
are;
one
is
syner gism,
second
is
metabiosis
and
third
is
antibiosis,
right.
These
three
are
the
changes
not
possible
by
single
microor ganisms
or
single
microbe,
right
and
three
types
of
such
changes
may
happen
one
by
syner gism
or
by
metabiosis
or
some
antibiosis
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
in
detail
of
it.
Syner gism,
what
is
that?
Syner gism
is
changes
brought
by
two
microbes
not
a
single
one,
right.
Syner gis,
syner gistic,
syner gisis
all
these
word
has
come
along
with
it
that
syner gism
that
it
is
not
one
it
is
done
by
more
than
one
or ganism
simultaneously ,
at
the
same
condition
same
everything
remaining
same
they
or
two
or ganisms
residing
simultaneously ,
that
is
called
syner gism
like
friendly
two
friend
staying
together
syner gism,
right.
So,
changes
brought
by
two
microbes
not
a
single
one.
Mixed
starter ,
that
is,
streptococcus
lactis
and
leuconostoc
species
they
can
do
this
change
simultaneously ,
one
example
mixed
starter
that
is
streptococcus
lactis
and
leuconostoc
species,
right.
Leuconostoc
convert
citrate
to
volatile
citrate
to
volatile
compounds
only
at
low
pH
and
the
other
one
lowering
of
pH
due
to
lactic
acid
production
is
done
by
streptococcus
lactis,
right.
So,
blue
discoloration
that
pseudomonas
species,
pseudomonas
species
may
or
pseudomonas
sync
syncyanea
syncyanea
syncyanea
only
in
association
with
streptococcus
lactis
can
for
the
blue
discoloration.
Lactic
acid
bacteria
required
for
yeast
creaminess
yeast
creamy
defect
that
is
done
by
candida
pseudotropicalis
or
torulopis
sorry
torulopsis
in
cream,
they
produce
these
are
the
yeast
which
is
called
creamy
yeast
or
yeasty
creamy
rather
yeasty
creamy ,
right.
So,
that
kind
of
condition
happens.
Then
coagulation
of
milk
and
foaming
for
subsequent
gas
production
by
yeasts.
So,
these
are
all
under
symbiosism
or
that
right.
So,
when
they
are
doing
together
staying
together
then
that
maybe
because
of
symbiosis
symbiosism,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
then
if
you
look
at
syner gism,
right
it
could
be
like
that.
Then
metabiosis;
metabiosis
is
a
process
where
food
chain
is
formed
that
is
one
or ganism
has
produced
one
product
another
or ganism
is
using
this
and
producing
another
product
that
is
called
food
chain
is
formed.
Metabolic
end
products
of
one
are
utilized
as
food
by
the
other
or
producing
final
change,
right.
Swiss
cheese
where
lactose
is
produced
by
lactic
acid
lactose
is
used
to
produce
lactic
acid
by
bacteria
which
is
utilized
by
propion
propionibacteria
to
produce
propionic
acid
which
is
nothing,
but
a
flavour
producing
compound
in
cheese
or
typically
swiss
cheese,
right.
Then,
spoilage
of
raw
milk
spoilage
of
raw
milk
at
room
temperature
that
could
be
by
this,
right
that
then
curdling
of
milk
by
streptococcus
lactis
which
is
because
the
precipitation
of
the
casein
because
of
that
up
to
1
percent
it
is
acidity
or
lactobacilli
which
is
by
lactobacillus
casei
that
convert
rest
of
the
lactose
to
lactic
acid
which
is
around
2
percent
lactic
acid.
Molds
generally
say
geotrichum
candidum
growth
on
surface
and
reduce
acidity
by
oxidizing
lactic
acid
to
carbon
dioxide
and
water .
So,
one
is
producing
one
food
that
food
is
utilized
by
another
or ganism
producing
another
right
or
chains
reduced
acidity
proteolytic
spore
formers
like
bacillus
degrade
casein
fraction.
So,
reduce
the
acidity
proteolytic
spore
formers
degrade
casein
fraction
subsequently
lipolytic
bacteria
develop
and
utilize
fat
fraction
and
decomposed
mass-water
inor ganic
substances
carbon
dioxide,
ammonia,
hydrogen
etcetera
are
also
produced,
right.
I
would
like
to
complete
that
antibiosis
and
this
otherwise
we
will
be
lacking
lot
of
time.
So,
in
antibiosis
that
is
one
or ganism
inhibits
or
suppresses
the
growth
of
the
other
or ganisms
which
I
said
that
lactic
acid
is
being
produced
by
lactic
acid
bacteria.
So,
that
product
is
inhibiting
the
growth
of
other
or ganisms,
right.
So,
it
is
called
competitive
inhibition.
This
is
called
competitive
inhibition,
right.
If
you
have
I
gave
the
exam
I
gave
that
reference
leininger
if
you
have
seen
that
there
Michael’ s
maintain
reaction
is
there.
So,
there
according
to
that
this
is
competitive
inhibition
that
inhibitions
of
the
growth
or ganisms
are
done
by
the
two
and
one
is
suppressing
the
other ,
right.
So,
lactic
acid
bacteria
cause
the
inhibition
of
proteolytic
or ganisms
that
is
spore
formers.
Starter
cultures
do
not
propagate
well
in
constituted
milk
reconstituted
milk
that
milk
which
is
reconstituted
milks
from
the
dry
powder
it
is
constituted,
right.
Certain
quantity
of
dry
powder
is
taken
and
some
that
proportion
of
water
is
added
and
mixed
so,
this
is
called
the
reconstitution
of
milk.
So,
their
starter
cultures
do
not
propagate
well
in
reconstituted
milk.
Certain
preformed
substances
inhibitory
to
starter
bacteria
are
elaborated
in
milk
and
get
carried
over
to
the
product
during
subsequent
drying,
right.
So,
with
this
and
all
three
we
finished
this
class
and
subsequently
we
will
also
continue
on
this
aspect,
ok.
Thank
you.
