Cheddar
Cheese
So,
we
said
in
the
previous
class
that,
we
have
made
cottage
cheese,
because
very
easy
to
prepare
it
right.
You
don’t
have
to
make,
get
rennet
you
don’t
have
to
do
ripening
all
these.
So,
very
easy
and
in
many
of
the
houses
this
cottage
cheese
nowadays,
they
are
producing
right.
And
it
is
almost
similar
to
making
paneer
or
things
like
that.
So,
it’s
not
very
very
difficult.
But
the
other
one
which
we
now,
will
deal
with
is
the
cheddar
1
in
our
52nd
class.
We
will
deal
with
the
cheddar
cheese
and
this
is
definitely
a
little
more
tough
than
preparing
cottage
cheese
right.
And
let
us
look
into
how
cheddar
cheese
is
being
made.
And
cheddar
is
a
typical
term
where
you
will
see
that
piling
re-piling
all
these
are
there
right.
So,
you
have
a
heap
of
this
and
they
are
a
made
upside
down,
so
made
a
pile
and
then
again
upside
down.
So,
like
that
this
is
basically
to
drain
the
moisture
right.
So,
that
is
followed
in
this
cheddar
cheese
preparation.
So,
let
us
look
into
the
cheddar
cheese,
which
is
close
texture
bacterial
ripened
cheese
and
in
this
process,
cheddar
is
hard,
close
texture,
bacterial
ripened
cheese,
made
from
cow's
milk.
Raw
or
pasteurized
milk
may
be
used
cheddaring
is
the
name
given
to
step
in
making
cheese
which
includes-
packaging,
turning,
piling,
repiling
the
curd
right.
So,
the
method
used
let
us
go
quickly ,
because
we
will
have
not
very
very
high
time,
much
time.
So,
hopefully
in
this
class,
we
should
cover
the
cheddar
cheese
and
rest
of
the
part
of
the
cheese.
So,
we
will
proceed
a
little
quicker
than
earlier ,
unless
there
is
a
requirement
for
explicit
explanation.
We
will
proceed,
because
this
is
manufacturing
process
right.
So,
understanding
is
less,
but
the
procedure
is
more.
So,
that
will
follow
very
quickly .
So,
if
we
look
at
that
the
method
is
pasteurized
high
quality
standard
milk
where
casein
fat
ratio,
it
adjusted
to
0.7
plus
minus
point
0.01
percent
right.
So,
not
percent,
it
is
ratio
casein
to
fat
ratio
is
0.7
plus
minus
0.1
or
0.01.
Milk
is
taken
in
the
cheese
vat
and
temperature
is
carefully
adjusted
to
30
degree
centigrade,
then
inoculate,
I
hope
inoculation
we
have
said
earlier
also
inoculation
means
suppose,
we
have
this
is
a
making
process
right
and
we
have
to
inoculate
say
in
a
pipette,
you
take
it
and
then
add
it
to
that.
This
is
from
the
source
right
from
the
starter
culture,
where
you
have
taken
is
your
definite
quantity
may
be
1
ml
10
ml
that
depends
on
the
quantity
you
have
already
measured
and
then
you
transfer
it
to
that
this
is
called
inoculation
right.
So,
these
inoculate
with
fine
active
lactic
starter
at
the
rate
of
0.5
to
1
percent
usually
0.7
percent
after
straining
and
stir
thoroughly .
So,
test
for
acidity
and
that
should
not
be
0.005
to
0.01
percent
more
than
that
right.
Originally ,
0.25
percent
0.25
to
0.4
percent
rennet
is
added,
diluted
to
20
times
of
its
volume
with
cold
water
and
it
makes
possible
to
distribute
the
rennet
thoroughly
and
uniformly ,
because
you
are
diluting
that
is
why
the
rennet
which
you
are
adding
that
is
uniformly
going
to
all
over
the
milk,
so
that
your
localized
fermentation
is
not
there
right,
you
are
making
culture.
So,
that
should
be,
that
is
why
stirring
is
also
required
that
uniformity
of
the
distribution
of
the
organisms
are
to
be
there.
So,
that
the
acid
which
is
produced
are
also
more
or
less
same
all
over
right.
Now ,
milk
is
stirred,
milk
is
stirred
thoroughly
for
3
to
5
minute
after
rennet
is
added
and
agitators
are
taken
out,
leaving
a
cover
on
the
vat
to
keep
the
surface
warm
and
clean
curd
is
set.
Now ,
after
that
curd
is
ready
to
cut
after
25
to
30
minute
of
addition
of
the
rennet.
It
will
give
a
clean
split
when
the
thermometer
or
any
such
thing
is
inserted
at
45
degree
angle
and
then
lifted
straight
out.
I
don’t
know
whether
you
have
seen
at
home
that
your
seniors
they
are
making
cake
and
other
things
right.
So,
it
is
a
bake
product.
So,
when
cake
is
being
made.
So,
that
cake
from
outside
you
will
not
be
say
this
one
outside,
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
whether
the
interior
moisture
is
also
dried
or
not.
So,
for
that
what
do
they
do
they
also
put
a
stick
and
put
it
inside
and
see
whether
moisture
is
adhering
to
that
or
not.
In
the
same
similar
way
here
also
you
are
testing
that
moisture
right.
So,
that
45
degree
angle
and
then
lifted
straight
out
right.
Then,
when
whey
immediately
after
cutting
contents
around
0
to
0.5
to
0.08
whereas,
the
0.05
to
0.08
percent
less
titrable
acidity
than
the
milk,
at
the
time
of
renneting;
this
is
because
the
curd
contains
practically
all
the
casein
and
a
portion
of
the
phosphates.
Free
whey
quickly
appears
between
the
cut
cubes
of
curd
and
the
curd
tends
to
sink
slowly .
Agitation
starts,
but
should
not
be
vigorous
such
that
curd
is
broken.
Then
matting
should
also
be
avoided
right.
Then
we
come
to
that
heating
or
cooking
begins
within
15
minutes
after
cutting.
Enough
free
whey
should
be
there
in
the
vat
to
float
the
curd.
It
helps
to
keep
curd
away
from
direct
contact
with
the
vat
and
cooking
should
be
started
slowly
so
that
38.8
degree
centigrade
will
reach
within
30
minutes.
The
time
temperature
combination
is
like
is
that
0th
time,
if
the
temperature
is
31
degree
centigrade,
after
5
minutes
it
should
be
31.6
degree
centigrade,
after
10
minutes
it
should
be
32.6
degree
centigrade,
after
15
minutes
it
should
be
33.8
degree
centigrade,
20
minutes
35.5,
25
minutes
37.2
and
30
minutes
38.8.
So,
this
way
the
temperature
is
increased
very
slowly
over
a
period
of
30
minutes
right.
So,
that
is
why
I
said
in
the
beginning
that
making
cottage
cheese
is
much
easier;
so,
but
cheddar
cheese
another
process
where
both
ripening
are
also
there,
that
is
why
I
thought,
let
it
also
be
told
to
you
right.
Then
after
turning
off
steam
continue
stirring
slowly
for
a
total
period
of
45
minute
at
this
time
the
curd
will
be
will
begin
to
fill
short
will
begin
to
fill
shotty
firm
and
somewhat
elastic
when
squeezed.
Curd
particles
will
be
only
about
half
as
large
as
they
were
at
cutting.
Acidity
will
be
approaching
the
desired
limit
of
0.12
to
0.13
percent.
No
soft
centers
of
curd
particles
are
there
right.
Stirring
is
stopped.
Curd
is
allowed
to
settle
to
the
bottom
of
the
vat.
Insert
this
stir,
insert
the
strainer
and
start
to
draw
the
whey .
So,
by
strainer
you
have
seen
that
people
are
using
things
like
some
net
where
the
fish
ring
is
being
done
similar
way
that,
through
that
the
strainer
this
curd
is
lifted
or
separated.
Cover
the
vat
to
keep
the
curd
warm
and
clean.
And
cheddaring
that
is
packing,
turning,
piling
and
repiling
is
there
and
it
lasts
for
around
2
hours,
right.
Then,
your
cheddaring
is
done.
There
are
two
objectives
to
do
that
cheddaring:
a
one
is
to
control
the
moisture,
and
another
is
to
form
the
characteristics
body
and
texture.
Now ,
these
four
things
which
are
primary
for
the
cheddaring
or
cheddar
cheese
that
should
be:
one
is
packaging
that
is
interval
packaging,
interval
between
dipping
and
packing
is
not
less
than
5
minute
and
not
longer
than
15
minute
within
5
to
15
minute
has
to
be
done.
Thickness
of
the
curd
slab
reduces
by
a
1
or
2
inches,
cut
the
blocks
in
6
inch
thick
or
6
and
8
inch
wide
and
20
inch
long
right.
So,
you
have
a
block
where
it
is
6
inch
in
thickness
right,
6
inch
in
thickness;
so
this
is
the
6
inch
and
6
to
8
inch
wide.
So,
that
is
6
to
8
inch
wide,
the
other
one
is
the;
this
is
6
to
8
inch
wide
and
long
maybe
20
inch.
So,
we
have
made
a
little
bigger
right.
So,
roll
bottom
side
up
in
the
vat
then
turning.
So,
turn
at
intervals
of
15
minute
and
repeat
at
every
15
minute
interval,
till
the
curd
is
ready
for
milling
and
salting,
keep
vat
covered
to
maintain
temperature
after
every
turning
and
to
prevent
air
borne
contamination
for
best
result
curd
is
kept
above
32.2
degrees
centigrade.
Then
your
piling
and
repiling
comes.
So,
piling
is
done,
piling
the
block
two
high
in
30
to
45
minute,
after
packing
the
blocks
are
turned
piled
two
high
temperatures
is
2
to
3
degree,
less
than
at
the
time
of
dipping.
At
this
time
the
blocks
are
about
24
inch
long
and
3
to
4
inch
thick.
They
can
be
cut
to
12
inch
long
to
handle
them
with
ease,
the
blocks
are
turned
after
the
usual
15
minute
interval
and
piled
two
high
blocks
from
the
top
layer
are
placed
in
the
bottom
layer .
Piling
the
blocks
three
high
at
30
to
45
minute,
after
piling
two
high
blocks
are
turned
again
and
piled
in
three
layers.
This
is
for
control
of
moisture
and
very
close
texture,
if
desired
occasionally
more
than
three
layers
are
also
being
made
right.
Then
end
of
the
cheddaring,
how
we
will
come
to
know
that
it
lasts
for
approximately
2
hours
time
period
is
extended,
if
lower
moisture
and
very
close
texture
is
desired.
So,
the
lower
the
moisture,
the
texture
will
be
very
close
be
the
higher
the
moisture
texture
will
be
a
little
open
right.
So,
more
compactness
will
be
there,
if
the
moisture
content
is
low;
that
is
why
if
you
need
more
then
maybe
some
more
time
you
have
to
add.
Whey
draining
from
the
curd
should
have
0.3
to
0.35
percent
more
acid
then
at
the
time
of
cutting
around
1
percent.
PH
about
5.4
body
is
plastic
smooth
to
the
touch
and
can
be
torn
apart
in
thin
meaty
shreds
or
strips
the
temperature
is
approximately
32
degree
centigrade,
then
it
is
milled.
So,
milling
the
curd
is
around
with
5
8
inch
square
and
2
inch
long
milled,
using
a
mill.
Stir
it
enough
to
prevent
matting
rather
stir
it
enough
to
prevented
matting
and
then
salting
the
curd,
the
desired
salt
content
is
approximately
around
1.5
percent,
but
may
not
range
between
or
it
should
not
be
more
than
2
percent,
maybe
it
is
ranging
between
1
to
2
percent.
Then
add
this,
added
this,
salt
is
added
in
3
to
4
parts
uniformly
over
the
curd
and
each
time
the
curd
is
led
to
drain
for
10
minutes,
so
that
salt
is
dissolved
and
curd
is
smooth
feeling
firm
and
elastic.
Then
hooping:
the
hooping
is
a
another
one
which
I
give
example:
that
you
might
have
seen
at
home
your
seniors,
they
are
making
some
something
like,
like,
like
embroidery
or
things
like
that.
So,
they
are
making
a
frame
right
and
in
that
frame
there
are
two;
maybe
if
it
is
circular
one,
but
it
is
may
be
square
or,
or,
or
rectangular
depending
on
what
type
of
things
are
being
done.
But
there
if
we
say,
if
it
is
rectangular ,
if
it
is
circular
then
there
are
two
and
then
at
on
the
top
there
is
some
thread
and
nut
things
are
there
to
tighten
and
other
things
and
the
cloth
is
placed
between
the
two
right.
So,
hooping
is
such
a
thing
right,
you
have
one
such
container
right
and
in
that
another
container
say
like
this.
So,
this
is
the
open
space
right.
And
your
strainer
or
the
cloth
is
put
in
between
so
that
your
material
that
is
the
curd
can
be
put
in
that.
So,
that
is
what
hooping.
So,
hooping,
pressing,
and
dressing
are
done,
the
temperature
of
the
curd
is
between
30.5
to
31.5
degree
centigrade.
Press
as
soon
as
the
hoops
are
filled,
press
hard
enough
at
first
to
start
the
way
dripping
from
each
hoop,
increase
the
pressure
gradually
until
full
pressure
is
applied
in
15
minute
after
starting.
The
curd
is
ready
to
dress,
not
sooner
than
15
minute
after
full
pressure
has
been
applied.
Then,
removing
the
cheese
from
the
hoop
is
like
that;
removing
the
cheese
from
the
hoop
is
that
next
morning,
take
the
cheese
from
the
hoops
weighed
marked
with
date,
lot
number
etcetera.
The
cheese
is
removed
from
the
making
room
to
the
drying
room,
where
it
is
neatly
arranged
on
clean
shelves
or
tables.
Temperature
is
maintained
around
12.7
to
15.5
degree
centigrade
with
relative
humidity
of
around
50
percent.
That
means,
you
see
that
if
relative
humidity
is
made
low,
such
that
moisture
from
outside
cannot
come
in
right.
So,
moisture
from
outside
cannot
come
in
and
that
is
the
primary
for
the
this
river
from
the
hooping,
when
you
are
packing
it,
so
that
moisture
is
adhere
to
or
if
it
is
observed,
then
the
closeness
of
the
cheese
will
be
hampered
right.
So,
moist
is
the
humidity
is
around
50
percent,
the
cheese
is
turned
at
24
hour
interval
so
that
both
ends
and
sides
can
dry
to
form
rather
desired
rind.
Each
time
during
turning
wipe
off
the
surface
of
the
shelves
with
a
clean
dry
cloth,
cheese
will
show
proper
rind
development
in
3
to
4
days.
Then
paraf fining:
again
this
is
of
course,
nowadays
in
many
cases
paraf fins
are
not
used,
but
I
don’t
know ,
you
can
ask
your
parents,
if
they
are
sufficiently
old.
Then
in
a
earlier
days,
when
this
jam
jelly
marmalade,
they
were
also
available
in
the
market,
then
the
people
used
to
put
one
layer
of
paraf fin
on
the
top
right.
The
primary
reason
is
that
it
should
not
allow
the
moisture
to
go
out
number
1
and
that
cap,
which
you
are
putting
when
if
some
moisture
is
evaporated
and
put
some
droplets
over
there,
should
not
fall
into
that.
So,
that
contamination
can
take
place.
So,
here
also
this
paraf fining
is
primarily
done
to
allow ,
rather
to
keep
the
moisture
inside
the
cheese
intact
right.
So,
paraf fining
is
done,
cheese
for
a
few
seconds,
there
is
3
to
5
minute
into
a
batch
of
melted
paraf fin
right.
Temperature
is
around
115
to
121
degree
centigrade
or
a
mixture
of
paraf fin
and
wax
to
get
a
thin
and
somewhat
flexible
coating.
So,
these
coating
helps
the
moisture
to
remain
inside.
That
is
the
primary
objective
that
moisture
should
not
go
out
right.
Then
curing:
these
are
some
associated
things,
which
we
are
now
covering
right.
Because
this
is
not
only
in
the
case
of
cheddar
cheese,
but
also
in
all
other
cheese,
these
words
or
these
for
typical
operations
are
also
done
curing,
then
your
green
cheese,
what
is
that
The
name
green
appears,
that
it
is
green
in
colored
makes
not
so
like
that.
So,
these
are
associated
which
we
said
that
we
shall,
we
should
cover
in
this
and
I
don’t
know
how
many
still
we
have
around
5
minutes
time.
Within
this
we
should
finish
cheese
otherwise
we
will
be
in
trouble
with
time,
right.
So,
curing
definition
is
like
this
that
the
curing
or
ripening
or
souring
or
maturing
of
cheese
refers
to
the
storage
of
cheese
for
at
least
2
to
3
months
at
a
given
low
temperature
of
0
to
16
degree
centigrade.
During
which
physical
chemical
bacteriological
properties
are
profoundly
changed,
resulting
in
the
development
of
characteristic
flavor
body
and
texture,
right.
The
term
green
cheese
that
which
we
call
is
usually
applied
to
hard
pressed
cheese
in
the
early
stage
of
ripening
before
the
characteristic
flavor
body
and
texture
of
ripen
cheese
are
developed.
So,
it
is
before
the
cheese
is
ripened,
whatever
you
have
received
now,
you
will
put
it
for
ripening
that
is
called
green
cheese
right.
So,
green
cheese
is
unripened,
before
it
is
putting
into
ripening
that
is
the
green
cheese
right.
Then
ripening
edges
are
many ,
so
mainly
bacteria
and
moulds
and
enzymes
including
pepsin.
They
are
used
and
the
system
of
curing
is
like
that
say
some
examples,
we
have
given
that
temperature
between
0
to
4
degree
centigrade
that
is
called
cold
curing
and
if
it
is
one
curing
between
10
to
16
degree
centigrade,
average
temperature
is
1.5
and
average
temperature
is
12.5.
Humidity ,
generally
high,
humidity
75
percent
85
percent,
duration
here,
it
is
for
cold
curing
3
to
12
months,
for
one
curing
it
is
up
to
2
months.
And
quality
of
cheese
obtained
is
normally
mild
flavour
bacterial
defects
minimized
and
it
could
be
sharp
flavour
bacterial
defects
could
be
exaggerated,
because
temperature
is
increased
right.
Then,
changes
during
curing,
what
it
makes:
first
is
flavor
lot
many
flavors
are
developed
from
mildly
acid
taste
and
aroma,
no
real
cheese
flavor
in
green
cheese
to
the
development
of
the
characteristic
flavour
of
ripened
cheese,
which
is
a
blend
of
several
odours
and
tastes,
such
as
in
diacetyl
in
mild
cheese
to
traces
of
odours
of
butyric
and
cproic.
This
is
a
cproic
acid,
esters
of
alcohol,
salts
of
propionic
acid
and
acetic
acids
in
well
aged
cheese
and
pungent
odours
of
compounds
of
ammonia
and
sometimes
hydrogen
sulfide
in
very
old
cheese.
That
is
during
curing,
it
is
developed
in
flavor
right.
Somebody
are
also
developed
texture
fairly
close
to
close
texture
chemicals,
which
are
used
are
fermentation
of
lactose
to
lactic
acid
and
small
amount
of
acetic,
propionic
acid
and
carbon
dioxide.
They
are
also
formed
proteolysis
and
a
slight
fat
break
down
proteins
are
broken
down
to
more
soluble
fractions
of
about
25
percent
ammonia
produced
by
certain
moulds
and
bacteria
may
have
considerable
effect
on
pH.
Then,
pH
is
generally
like
this
in
the
cheddar
cheese
typically ,
it
appears
like
that
in
relation
to
the
edge
3
days
old
your
pH
is
5.05,
7
days
old
5.06,
49
days
old
5.13,
9
months
old
5.32
and
25,
24
months,
2
year
old
5.58.
So,
you
see
from
5
to
0.58
that
is
increased
pH
right.
So,
the
acidity
of
course,
is
getting
decreased
right.
The
value
of
pH
mould
means
the
acidity
is
becoming
less.
Then
I
hope
this
is
perhaps
the,
a
microbial
changes
ok.
All
cheese
should
contain
predominantly
lactic
streptococci
during
manufacture
and
early
stage
of
curing
cheddar
cheese
are
low
in
moisture
and
close
in
textures
that
sustain
a
steady
change
over
from
streptococci
to
lactobacilli,
some
of
which
contribute
to
the
flavor .
Other
types
of
are
of
course,
present
and
the
higher
the
proportion
of
miscellaneous
types,
the
quicker
is
the
curing
and
greater
the
possibility
of
off
flavor
right.
So,
ripening
index
is
percent
soluble
nitrogen
over
percent
total
nitrogen
times
100.
So,
I
hope
we
have
cross
the
time,
and
let
us
say
that
we
have
said
as
much
as
we
can
in
cheese,
right.
Thank
you.
