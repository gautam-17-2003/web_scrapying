Ice
Cream
Lolies
So,
we
were
discussing
about
Ice
cream
right.
Now
in
this
class
in
our
earlier
of
course,
we
had
discuss
the
ice
cream,
now
we
will
discuss
about
the
Ice
Cream
Lolies
also
right.
W e
have
discussed
about
the
cups,
then
party
packs,
then
gallon
packs,
dif ferent
forms
which
are
available
right.
And
how
they
are
manufactured
and
what
is
the
process
etcetera
everything,
we
have
discussed.
Now ,
in
this
dairy
and
food
process
and
products
technology
today’ s
lecture
55,
where
we
will
discuss
Ice
Cream
Lolies
right.
But
before
that
perhaps
so
for
I
remember
we
had
told
you
about
horizontal
Ice
cream
freezer
right.
Generally
unless
there
is
a
constraint
of
space
if
space
is
not
the
constraint;
then
people
do
prefer
horizontal
freezer .
But
in
many
cases,
there
could
be
the
space
problem.
So,
horizontal
means
say
1.5
meter
Ice
cream
freezer
along
with
its
accessories
all
put
together
maybe
2
meters
and
people
working
etcetera
everything
will
take
another .
So,
3
square
meter
area
you
may
need
for
one
Ice
cream
freezer
to
be
handled
with
the
product.
So,
if
that
is
too
costly
for
the
place
where
your
industry
is;
then
the
problem
comes
and
that
is
why
another
mode
there
is
the
vertical
freezers
are
also
developed.
And
in
both
these
horizontal
and
vertical
now
a
days
in
our
country
Alfa
Laval
in
the
earlier
APB,
they
where
is
to
perhaps
the
only
producer .
But
nowadays
it
is
a
now
means
long
back
it
is
not
today .
Long
back
Alfa
Laval
and
many
others
have
come
up
with
Ice
cream
freezers
and
both
horizontal
as
well
as
vertical
are
available
right.
So,
then
let
us
look
into
the
vertical
also
a
little.So,
this
is
a
typical
vertical
Ice
cream
freezer
and
this
is
taken
from
Alfa
Laval
right.
And
you
see
from
this
a
cut
size
has
been
shown
here
right,
from
where
other
ways
from
outside
you
will
not
understand
anything
right.
The
horizontal
one
we
had
shown
you
the
sectional
view ,
but
this
is
a
vertical
with
a
cut
right.
So,
what
happens?
Y ou
see
your
product
inlet
is
this
one.
So,
this
is
the
product
inlet
through
each
product
is
going
in
right.
Then
there
is
floating,
pouring,
there;
these
are
all
support
supporting.
Then
these
are
the
blades
right
these
are
the
blades
Ice
cream
that
scraper
blade.
So,
that
scraper
blade
is
here
then
this
is
the
heat
transfer
wall.
So,
heat
transfer
wall
is
this
through
which
the
refrigerant
is
transferring
the
load,
then
there
is
a
rotor
shaft
this
is
the
rotor
shaft.
So,
rotor
shaft
will
rotate
your ,
the
enter
entire
assembly
then
this
is
the
insulation.
So,
insulation
that
comes
through
this
black
wala
the
insulation.
Then
media
channel
that
is
through
which
it
is
moving
that
is
the
channel.
Then
the
media
that
is
by
which
you
are
cooling
goes
through
this
right.
And
if
you
look
at
this
is
the
vertical
view
or
front
view
and
if
you
see
the
top
view
it
looks
like
this
right.
So,
blade,
rotor
and
heating
or
cooling
medium
and
then
product
and
the
heat
transfer
cylinder ,
all
these
are
there
ok.
And
this
media
that
is
heating
or
cooling
media
that
comes
out
through
this.
And
again
it
is
subjected
to
if
it
is
compressor ,
condenser ,
expansion
device.
All
put
together ,
they
are
associated
with
this
that
is
why
this
is
a
cut
figure
down
below
these
things
do
content
and
that
is
not
visible.
And
near
mounting
connect
this
mounting
connector
here
ok.
How
they
are
being
connected?
And
this
is
the
hydraulic
drive
by
which
your
product
is
going
out
right.
And
this
product
when
it
is
going
out
before
that
you
can
you
can
incorporate
your
nuts
and
fruits
or
whatever
you
would
like,
those
things
are
possible.
But
the
thing
is
which
is
of
interest
is
that
this
length
right
there
is
the
freezer
length.
And
if
you
look
into
the
horizontal
one
I
would
like
to
show
you
that
also
that
visible
this
length
that
this
is
the
freezer
length
say
it
is
L
vertical.
And
you
see
that
from
the
geometry
it
appears;
from
the
geometry
it
appears
that
this
one
is
the
horizontal
right
and
the
horizontal
length
is
this
L
H
right.
So,
this
L
H
is
much
much
less
than
for
the
same
capacity .
W e
said
generally
300
to
700
liters
per
hour
that
is
available
commercially
right.
If
this
is
true
then,
this
L
H
is
less
than
is
v
the
reverse
this
L
H
is
much
much
less
than
L
V ,
yes
this
is
much
much
less
than
L
V
for
the
given
capacity ,
say
three
hundred
liters
per
hour
in
that
case
this
L
V
is
much
much
bigger
than
L
H
right.
So
that
is
what
one
thing
to
be
kept
in
mind.
Another
thing
which
is
why
it
is
required?
Because
here
your
thing
is
being
pumped
and
going
like
this.
So,
all
the
time
it
is
also
acting
against
the
gravity
right.
Generally
this
product
would
have
a
tendency
when
going
up
gravity
will
pull
it
down
right.
So,
the
inlet
was
in
earlier
case,
also
4
degree
centigrade
and
the
exit
was
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade;
if
you
remember
that
inlet
was
like
this
and
exit
was
like
that
right.
So,
the
retention
time
in
this
has
to
be
such
that
that
4
degree
to
minus
5
degree
this
conversion
because
this
is
a
continuous.
So,
this
conversion
has
to
take
place
according
to
the
height
on
according
to
the
freezer
length
right.
If
this
is
the
freer
length,
then
according
to
that
this
conversion
of
4
degree
to
minus
5
degree;
where
incorporation
of
this
is
the
product
in
later
along
with
the
same
it
was
a
dual
pump
there.
Here
also
it
can
be
a
dual
pump
and
product
will
go,
air
also
will
go
so
both
will
go
together
and
they
will
go
pass
through
this
and
this
is
the
scrapper
blade
right.
So,
these
scraper
blades
where
you
remember
what
I
said
that
if
this
is
the
wall
right.
If
Ice
cream
here
is
getting
frozen
Ice
cream
mix
here
at
4
degree
and
here
it
got
frozen
because
your
outside
is
minus
30
or
minus
40
depending
on
whatever
you
have
chosen
the
pressure
and
the
refrigerant
right.
So,
and
this
dependence
this
depends
on
your
inlet
pressure
of
the
refrigerant
and
the
exit
pressure
that
is
called
Dischar ge
pressure
and
the
Suction
pressure
right.
So,
dischar ge
and
suction
pressure
that
will
dictate
what
temperature
it
will
be
liquid?
And
at
how
much
you
will
get
in
terms
of
enthalpy
right?
So,
how
much
delta
H
you
will
get
that
will
be
dependent
on
how
you
are
keeping
it,
how
at
what
pressure
of
inlet
and
exit
of
the
refrigerant
you
are
keeping
right.
Then
this
and
we
also
said
that
the
refrigerant
is
getting
boiled
of f
right
this
is
called
boil
of f
boil
of f
heat
transfer .
So,
what
is
happening
that
the
moment
this
liquid
came
to
this,
it
gets
frozen
and
this
scraper
blades
when
they
are
rotating
like
this
scrapper
blade
is
scrapping
of f
and
then
it
is
mixing
with
rest
of
the
thing.
So,
plus
4
that
became
say
minus
5
or
even
lower .
And
this
plus
4
when
interior ,
they
were
there
will
be
a
mixing
between
this
plus
4
and
minus
5
and
a
resultant
temperature
will
come.
So,
like
that
the
temperature
of
the
Ice
cream
is
gradually
decreasing.
And
all
the
time
this
surface
is
getting
some
quantity
of
Ice
cream
frozen
and
the
then
it
is
getting
scrapped
of f
right.
So,
that
is
possible
that
is
why
and
how
this
plus
4
is
coming
at
minus
5
and
some
quantity
of
the
Ice
cream
is
getting
frozen
right.
And
one
more
thing
which
we
should
also
tell
here
is
that;
for
the
vertical
for
the
vertical
one,
this
length
being
higher
for
the
same
capacity
the
problem
which
normally
is
encountered
is
the
people
who
are
working
because
it
is
not
that
all
the
people
who
are
working
will
be
tall.
So,
that
becomes
a
dif ficulty
for
the
short
heighted
people
to
handle
to
get
this
output
right.
So,
it
becomes
handling
problem
nothing
else
right.
As
far
as
heat
transfer ,
as
far
as
product
quality ,
these
things
are
concerned,
there
is
no
such
deviation
over
there
is
no
such
discrepancy
between
vertical
and
horizontal.
But
this
problem
of
handling
that
is
over
thatcould
be
one
consideration
if
the
people
who
are
working
workers
are
not
tall
enough
then
it
becomes
dif ficult
for
them
to
handle.
Otherwise
as
for
you
see
that
floor
area
requirement
is
not
more
than
1
meter
square
whereas,
there
it
was
somewhere
2
to
3
meter
square.
So,
that
floor
radius
having
is
very
very
high
and
where
it
is
a
costly
place
there
it
becomes
mandatory
right.
Of
course,
I
have
seen
both
this
vertical
as
well
as
horizontal
once
in
yeah
where
I
used
to
work
there
all
the
things
were
horizontal.
I
had
shown
you
that
earlier
the
lay
out
plant
layout
I
had
shown.
But
here
in
Bengal
I
have
seen
that
in
some
of
the
Ice
cream
manufacturers
do
have
this
though
there
is
there
may
not
be
the
space
consideration
so
much
but
they
do
have
this
vertical
so
I
had
opportunity
to
see.
And
one
with
to
work
with
horizontal
where
I
was
and
the
other
one
is
with
the,
our
students
who
had
visited
number
of
times
and
seen
it
right
seen
it
to
working
also
ok.
So,
with
this
the
Ice
cream
freezer
let
us
come
over
to
another
that
the
lolly
preparation
right.
So,
this
is
the
lolly
preparation
tank,
I
don’ t
know
how
many
of
you
are
from
the
cities
or
from
the
villages.
And
those
who
are
in
urban
may
not
be,
but
those
who
are
in
villages
I
hope
they
might
have
seen
that
the
stick
lolly
sticks
only
water
colored
water
red
lolly
sticks
colored
water
and
sweet
sweetened
colored
water .
They
are
prepared
in
many
villages
right
typically
I
was
lucky
enough
again
to
see
in
just
by
the
side
of
our
school
it
was.
And
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
mention
and
that
when
you
were
also
school
children
of
that
age
our
parents
also
used
to
tell
of
course,
we
did
not
have
money
to
buy
like
today’ s
children
they
have
lot
of
pocket
money
etcetera,
but
we
did
not.
However
I
have
no
idea
with
what
with
what
I
mean
thing
in
mind
they
used
to
tell
that
don’ t
take
that
lolies
from
the
Ice
cream.
Because
those
lolies
are
being
made
from
dirty
water
ganda
pani
or
naali
ka
pani.
So,
this
ganda
pani
or
naali
ka
pani
that
is
dirty
water
that
was
one
thing
imposed
on
the
mind.
Such
that
you
get
afraid
and
you
don’ t
get
the
desire
though
you
do
not
have
money .
But
your
friends
may
have
and
they
may
buy
and
give
you
so,
to
prevent
that
this
kind
of
things
used
to
be
told.
But
so,
far
I
know
and
I
understand
that
there
is
no
such,
but
because
why
your
person
will
use
ganda
and
naali
pani.
Y es,
he
may
not
have
a
good
source
of
water ,
but
at
least
some
tap
water
or
some
drinking
water
they
should
use
and
they
use.
So,
there
is
no
question
of
using
the
ganda
or
naali
pani
right.
So,
because
that
is
loss
for
him
because
ultimately
if
the
productis
giving
some
bad
name
or
it
is,
if
it
is
the
consumer
is
getting
af fected;
then
definitely
their
cell
will
be
af fected
right.
But
we
use
to
see
how
the
things
were
prepared
right
and
so
for
I
remember
that
there
was
a
pond
kind
of
thing.
And
to
my
memory
and
that
pond
kind
of
thing
was
around
say
10,
12
feet
in
length
and
6,
7
feet
in
width
and
around
4
to
3
to
4
feet
height.
And
it
was
full
of
water
full
of
that
we
did
not
understand
why
and
what,
but
it
was
full
of
water .
But
also
we
saw
the
inside
there
are
some
machines.
Now
we
understand
that
those
machines
are
nothing,
but
the
evaporator
heat
exchanger
right.
So,
heat
exchanger
is
there
and
we
used
to
hear
the
compressor
sound.
W e
did
not
understand
that
time
some
sound
was
coming
from
outside
and
that
compressor
is
making
that
refrigeration
cooling
and
all
these
right.
And
of
course,
since
it
was
by
the
in
the
I
don’ t
say
city ,
but
semi
city
since
it
was
so
there
was
no
question
of
using
ammonia
as
the
refrigerant.
So
Freon
was
used
I
suppose,
now
because
it
was
long
back
30
40
years
back.
So,
I
don’ t
remember
the
whether
we
asked
what
was
the,
or
we
understood
what
was
that.
But
now
I
understand
that
was
definitely
Freon
only
and
in
our
country
though
Freon
has
been
banned.
But
not
to
that
extent
I
as
it
is
still
being
used
right.
So,
a
similar
one
here
we
are
showing
you
that
Ice
cream
lolies
are
being
made
in
this
kind
of
this
was
one
where
I
used
to
work
it
was
there.
So,
a
pond
circular
pond
like
that
right
and
you
see
the
height
as
it
is
sorry ,
height
as
it
is
around
3
to
4
feet
right,
around
3
to
4
feet.
And
this
diameter
can
be
somewhere
around
10
to
12
feet
right,
around
10
to
12
feet.
And
there
are
some
these
are
called
a
molds
there
are
some
molds
in
which,
if
this
is
the
mold
right.
If
this
is
the
mold
you
are
putting
you
are
putting
some
colour
remains
same
colour
does
not
change
yeah
colour
is
not
changing
however .
So,
there
some
Ice
cream
mix
is
being
put
here
and
up
to
this
it
is
filled
right.
And
a
stick
is
also
inserted
right.
So,
in
this
on
the
wall
on
this
wall
this
Ice
cream
when
it
is
frozen
that
will
get
stick.
So,
what
they
do
they
put
this
say
if
this
is
one
mold
of
course,
there
is
no
such
individual
mold.
At
least,
10,
12
Ice
creams
are
there
and
things
are
arranged
in
such
a
way ,
that
minimum
8
to
10
lolies
could
be
placed
in
one.
So,
when
it
was
it
is
frozen
this
side
gets
stuck
so
you
cannot
take
out
this
stick
outside.
So,
what
happens
they
put
this
in
another
after
lifting
from
this
after
lifting
from
there.
They
put
in
water
this
is
the
water
right.
The
moment
it
is
put
on
the
water
because
this
is
made
of
made
of
made
of
solid
that
is
metal.
So,
this
heat
transfer
is
very
high
and
the
adjacent
to
this
the
ice
of
this
lolly
gets
melted
right
or
gets
loosened.
So,
that
time
they
make
the
thing
upside
down
and
during
that
period
the
stick
comes
out
and
we
get
a
stick
of
Ice
cream
lolly
like
this
right.
So,
this
is
and
not
only
that
I
gave
only
one
example
so
you
if
you
have
this
kind
of
thing
and
you
have
you
might
have
seen
that
lolies
are
with
dif ferent
layers
multi
layers.
So,
this
is
a
single
layer
of
say
vanilla,
this
is
another
layer
of
say
chocolate
and
this
is
another
layer
of
say
another
thing
chocolate
and
pineapple
say .
So,
what
they
do
first
and
for
that
you
have
to
have
dif ferent
molds
like
this
because
first
one
will
correspond
to
this
volume.
So,
according
to
this
volume,
this
mold
is
prepared
right
and
first
you
make
this
lolly
and
this
stick
is
there
put
it
inside
and
then
it
you
get
it
frozen.
So,
once
this
is
frozen
and
then
you
take
out
from
that
to
water
system
right.
This
water
system
you
loosen
it
and
then
take
it
out
right.
Then
you
have
this
new
volume
right.
And
this
one
is
made
in
such
a
way
that
your ,
this
volume
minus
this
volume
equal
to
that
one
right.
And
this
of
course,
will
go
in
and
this
extra
this
extra
layer
will
only
be
adhering
up
to
this
right.
So,
that
layer
will
be
this.
So,
like
this
second
layer
you
have
put
it
into
this
and
you
got
it
this
second
layer
present.
Similarly
you
have
put
in
this
water
and
take
we
took
it
out.
And
the
3rd
one
this
layer
is
then
according
to
the
volume
of
this
and
this
you
are
making
another
one
where
your
ultimately
the
lolly
becomes
like
that
right.
So,
this
way
multilayer
lolies
being
also
made,
but
the
primary
thing
which
is
that
you
have
to
keep
you
have
to
keep
these
lolies
inside.
And
not
only
that
these
lolies
inside
you
have
to
keep
for
maybe
2
to
3
hours
depending
on,
depending
on
whether
you
are
making
single
layer
or
you
are
making
multiple
layers
right.
If
you
are
making
single
layer
timing
requirement
will
be
more.
If
you
are
taking
multiple
layers
for
each
layer ,
you
may
have
to
have
a
less
time.
And
then
some
together
will
be
a
little
bigger
than
that
the
reason
being
you
are
taking
it
out
and
then
putting
it
to
another
mold,
then
again
putting
it
back
again
taking
it
out
again
from
defrosting
all
these
will
take
some
time.
So,
total
time
requirement
may
in
this
case
if
it
is
2
to
3
hours
in
that
case,
it
could
be
3
to
4
hours.
Obviously ,
that
single
layer
one
the
price
if
it
is
10
rupees,
say
your
this
multiple
layer
that
will
be
20
rupees.
So,
in
that
case
this
additional
time
investment
is
paying
you
back
through
the
price
and
also
the
customer
you
will
have
more
and
the
consumption
also
could
increase
because
you
are
giving
many
many
varieties
to
the
to
the
consumer
right.
So,
here
also
what
we
have
inside
of
it
which
I
cannot
show ,
why
I
did
not
have
that
time
that
much
of
today’ s
cameras.
So,
if
there
is
your
inside
there
is
your
heat
exchanger
so
that
heat
exchanger
throughout
is
this
tank.
And
this
heat
exchanger
is
being
cooled
by
the
refrigerant
generally
this
is
by
Freon
right
generally
this
is
by
Freon.
And
this
refrigerant
is
making
this
heat
exchanger
cold.
And
in
turn
this
heat
exchanger
is
cooling
inside
there
is
the
water
that
water .
And
this
is
not
a
simple
water
plane
this
is
called
brine
solution
right.So,
this
is
a
solution
who
brine
means
salt
solution,
but
this
is
not
simply
sodium
chloride.
It
can
be
chlorides
of
many
things
and
many
others
because
the
composition
I
is
I
also
did
not
come
to
know
because
it
is
very
much
company
secret.
If
I
would
have
worked
for
a
long
period
then
obviously ,
I
could
have
come
across.
But
I
did
not
try
also
because
I
did
not
have
that
intention
to
break
the
norms
of
the
company .
So,
I
did
not
try
to
know ,
but
this
I
know
from
theory
that
number
of
chlorides,
number
of
many
other
salts
are
there
and
that
is
being
produced.
That
is
that
is
keeping
the
water
solution
very
cold
and
may
be
around
plus
minus
30
degree
centigrade
it
this
water
temperature
inside
is
there
right.
So,
if
that
is
true
then
you
are
keeping
your
molds
inside
and
mold
is
such
that
in
this
if
this
is
the
mold
and
if
this
is
the
stake
and
if
up
to
this
your
liquid
right.
If
this
the
stick
of
course,
goes
down
if
up
to
this
it
is
the
liquid
then
in
what
are
this
tank
this
is
such
that
it
is
floating
just
like
this,
up
to
this
it
is
underwater ,
beyond
that
is
above
the
water
right.
It
is
just
it
is
dipping
and
floating.
So,
what
dipping
and
floating
are
together?
Dip
is
only
up
to
the
portion,
where
you
have
this
stick
lolly
up
to
that
portion
this
is
underwater .
And
beyond
that
is
not
in
the
water
system
or
brine
solution
right.
And
it
is
kept
for
that
2
to
3
hours
or
like
that
and
the
lolies
are
being
ready .
And
then
after
taking
out
is
the
wrappers
and
other
things
are
being
put
and
then
kept
in
the
cold
room.
This
does
not
need
to
go
to
the
hardening
that
hardening
which
we
had
seen
earlier
is
only
done
for
cups
cones
and
other
which
is
coming
out
from
the
freezer .
But
lolies
are
directly
prepared
and
they
are
cold
enough
and
this
goes
into
the
cold
room.
And
in
the
cold
room
things
are
kept
under
dif ferent
I
mean
that
the
storage
temperature
as
we
said
is
minus
20
or
below .
So,
minus
20
degree
centigrade;
it
is
being
kept
and
you
are
then
supply
to
the
tip
dif ferent
people
right.
So,
for
like
this
you
are
keeping
your
lolies
prepared
right.
One
thing
you
should
also
keep
in
mind
that
one
thing,
you
should
also
keep
in
mind
that
when
you
are
making
lolies
you
should
prepare,
you
should
be
ready
with
the
frozen
lolly
has
to
be
defrosted
to
unload
right
from
the
mold.
So,
you
are
defrosting
system
also
should
be
somewhere
very
close
to
this
right.
That
defrosting
system
also
should
be
somewhere
very
close
to
this
otherwise
if
you
are
freezing
system
is
here
and
you
have
to
move
around
and
then
find
out
the
lolly
how
it
is
to
be
dipped
then
unnecessarily
you
will
be
losing
time
which
you
cannot
ef fort
to
do.And
if
it
is
for
multi
layers
if
it
is
for
multi
layers
then
this
gives
lot
of
trouble
lot
of
problem
to
the
workers
right.
And
which
in
turn
will
decrease
the
throughput
or
the
production
rate.
So,
it
should
be
very
close
to
this
and
of
course,
there
the
this
floor
as
you
are
seeing
that
floor
also
that
is
true
for
any
food
industry .
That
the
floor
is
always
under
all
time
it
is
being
wiped
of f.
So,
that
there
is
no
residual
or
there
is
no
dirt
or
any
other
things.
That
is
the
basic
of
the
any
in
basic
of
any
industry
about
the
hygiene.
So,
hygiene
has
to
be
such
that
you
don’ t
have
any
problem
of
that
water
dropping
or
Ice
cream
makes
dropping.
So,
all
the
time
if
there
we
some
people
are
always
there
who
are
all
the
time
cleaning
the
floor;
such
that
it
becomes
very
very
clean
as
well
it
is
hygienic
right,
because
hygiene
is
the
primary
thing
and
these
are
all
frozen
material.
So,
afterwards
you
have
no
scope
to
heat
or
disinfected
this
infection
is
not
possible
afterwards.
So,
that
is
why
the
primary
thing
is
the
hygiene
and
that
will
minimize
the
chance
of
getting
contamination
because
there
mix
is
very
highly
as
a
highly
susceptible
to
be
infected
by
the
or ganisms
because
it
contains
all
the
materials.
So,
that
should
be
hygienically
very
very
good.
So,
that
the
chance
of
contamination
you
remove
right.
So,
this
way
lolies
are
being
made
and
this
is
called
the
brine
tank.
And
brine
tank
the
brine
solution
is
from
the
chlorides
and
many
others
chloride
nitrates
which
can
which
can
one
thing
which
I
did
not
say
that
is
the
eutectic
point
eutectic
point.
So,
the
eutectic
point
of
say
pure
sugar
right
pure
sugar
which
we
take
that
is
C6
C12
H22
O1 1
right
the
sucrose.
So,
that
is
somewhere
if
I
remember
correctly
around
minus
5
degree
centigrade.
Sodium
chloride
has
an
eutectic
point
of
say
minus
21
degrees
centigrade
right.
So,
like
that
when
they
are
making
the
brine
it
is
taken
in
such
a
way
that
even
at
minus
32
degree
centigrade.
The
brine
solution
remains
liquid
because
liquid
has
the
highest
heat
transfer .
So,
heat
transfer
will
be
very
good
and
it
will
be
liquid
and
this
pond
you
can
keep
it
is
closed
that
will
that
will
minimize
the
heat
loss
right.
Because
once
you
have
loaded
it
with
the
Ice
cream
lolies
and
then
for
to
our
2
to
3
or
it
will
be
there.
So,
you
can
keep
it
closed
so
that
the
unnecessarily
open
is
the
top
is
not
open
and
heat
is
being
transferring
from
the
top
to
the
water
brine
right.
So,
this
way
you
can
minimize
the
loss
and
maximize
the
profit
ok.
Thank
you.
