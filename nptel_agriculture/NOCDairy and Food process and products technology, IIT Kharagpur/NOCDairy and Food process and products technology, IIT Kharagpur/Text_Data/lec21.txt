Milk
Fat
So,
in
the
previous
class
we
are
discussing
with
the
Milk
Fat
right.
So,
in
this
class
of
Dairy
and
Food
Process
and
Product
T echnology ,
so
on
the
lecture
number
21,
sorry
in
the
lecture
number
21
we
are
coming
to
this
the
Milk
Fat
right.
So,
we
said
milk
fat
is
the
esters
of
fatty
acids
of
alcohol
or
glycerol
typically
used
esters
of
fatty
acids
of
glycerol
right,
it
can
be
mono
di
or
tri.
Now ,
then
it
comes
obviously
what
is
fatty
acids?
Right,
a
fatty
acid
is
a
long
chain
carboxylic
acid
right,
general
formula
it
can
be
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
n
COOH,
obviously
carboxylic
acid
is
COOH
right.
So,
it
has
I
do
not
know
whether
you
still
know
it
or
that
carbon
has
4
hands
like
that
means,
4
valency
right.
So,
it
can
combined
with
4
out
of
which
CH
3;
3
are
taken
out
so
1
remains
right,
or
C
O
H
in
there
also
C
O
O,
and
O
H
hopefully ,
we
know
that
how
C
O
O
H
is
written
right.
So,
this
is
C
this
is
double
one
O,
and
this
is
one,
hand
free,
and
this
is
H
right,
this
is
O
H
sorry
this
is
O
H
right.
This
is
O
H.
So,
if
we
C
O,
I
bars
O
double
bond
and
free
hand
this
is
O
H
right.
So,
if
that
be
true
then
this
hand
becomes
free
right.
This
is
what
the
valency
that
becomes
free,
so
this
if
we
substitute
with
1
hydrogen
that
is
H
C
double
bond
O
O
H.
Now ,
this
also
can
react
because
this
is
also
an
acid,
this
also
can
react
with
the
glycerol
right.
But
normally
formic
acid
is
1,
which
up
to
1,
2
or
3
carbons
normally
it
is
not
said
to
be
fatty
acid.
It
is
the
chain
means
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
n
COOH,
if
we
make
a
n
is
equals
to
1
then
it
becomes
CH
3,
CH
2,
COOH,
which
is
nothing
but
if
had
it
been
CH
3,
C
O
O
H
from
formic
acid,
then
it
is
acetic
acid,
then
it
is
propionic
acid
right.
So,
CH
3,
CH
2,
C
O
O
H
would
have
been
propionic
acid,
but
normally
up
to
3
it
is
avoided.
Normally
it
is
because
that
is
the
natural
occurrence
from
the
nature
the
occurrence
of
the
fatty
acids
is
seen
to
be
from
more
predominant
from
4
C
4
right.
But
C
4
constitutes
of
all
right,
let
me
clear
it
of
C
4
means
your
here
CH
3,
CH
2,
CH
2,
COOH
right.
This
goes
of f
eraser
highlight
eraser ,
so
these
goes
of f
right,
this
goes
of f
it
is
CH
3,
CH
2
like
that.
So,
in
that
case
this
is
the
butyric
acid
right.
Subsequently
you
will
see
in
our
class
or
in
books
also
you
will
see
this
COOH
though
there
is
a
carbon,
this
carbon
and
along
with
that
acidic
group
carboxylic
acidic
group,
they
are
taken
aside.
Normally ,
the
number
of
carbons
they
are
set
in
terms
of
this,
that
is
how
many
carbons
are
there
CH
3,
CH
2,
CH
2
that
is
3
carbon,
C
3
right.
Because
C
O
O
H
count
every
all
carboxylic
acid,
so
C
3,
C
5,
C
7,
C
9,
C
1 1.
These
are
all
odd
numbers
of
carbon
chain,
and
C
4,
C
A,
6
C
8,
C
10,
C
12,
C
16,
C
18,
they
are
all
even
number
of
carbon
chain
right,
and
because
carboxylic
acid
is
common
to
everybody
right.
So,
that
is
why
the
though
the
general
formula
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
n,
COOH
and
in
that
if
n
becomes
1
then
it
would
have
been
propionic
acid
the,
but
occurrence
of
the
mono
or
di
whatever
the
glycoride
occurrence
of
the
ester
of
glycerol
with
the
propionic
acid
or
acetic
acid
or
formic
acid
is
very
very
negligible
or
not
there
right.
So,
that
is
why
they
are
said
not
to
be
the
fatty
acid
right,
so
fatty
acid
then
we
tell
carboxylic
acid
with
carbon
chain
where
the
chain
length
is
minimum
for
with
the
carbon
without
carbonate
could
be
3.
So,
normal
this
3
onwards
we
take
there
could
be
normal
it
is
said
C
2
and
onward
because
of ficially
you
see,
we
if
we
put
n
is
equals
to
1
then
it
becomes
CH
3,
CH
2,
C
O
O
H,
so
it
is
2
other
than
carboxylic
acid.
So,
2
to
80
it
can
be,
but
that
is
maybe
one
in
C
80
or
C
70
may
be
in
one
in
thousands
or
lakhs
of
sources
you
may
get.
So,
that
cannot
be
taken
as,
but
commonly
mostly
it
is
between
C
4
to
C
20
within
this
range
most
of
the
fatty
acids
they
are
in
nature.
So,
we
call
accordingly
C
4
to
C
20
right,
so
many
varieties
are
available
in
nature
even
numbered
fatty
acids
are
more
in
nature
than
those
for
odd
numbers
ones.
Now ,
the
even
numbered
and
odd
number
as
we
have
said
this
is
don’ t
make
the
confusion
because
subsequently
you
will
see
that
it
depends
on
the
books
how
they
are
following,
the
writer
I
am
talking
about
the
basic
books,
I
am
not
talking
about
the
books
which
are
I
don’ t
say
copied,
but
at
least
which
are
edited
or
lot
of
writers
are
there.
If
it
is
single
author
book
normal
we
take
that
to
be
more
prominent
more
informative
etcetera
or
reliable.
So,
in
that
case
if
you
look
at
books
like
as
you
said
Fennema
or
Meyer;
these
are
some
of
the
food
chemistry
or
this
oriented
or
technology
oriented
books
are
there.
So,
if
you
look
at
them
some
books
may
also
follow
that
the
even
number
is
with
the
fatty
acid.
Some
books
may
say
you
know
since
fatty
acid
is
always
there
in
that
acidic
group
is
always
there.
So,
if
we
remove
that
and
tell
about
the
chain
length
in
terms
of
number
of
carbon
atoms
then
it
becomes
more
convenient.
So,
that
is
why
even
or
odd
that
is
subjective,
so,
if
you
are
considering
the
carboxylic
group
also
as
one
of
the
member
then
even
numbers
are
more
prominent
or
more
available
in
nature
than
the
odd
numbers,
but
if
the
reverse
if
keeping
aside
the
carboxylic
acid
group
then
we
say
that
odd
numbers
are
more
available
in
nature
then
the
even
numbers
right.
So,
you
can
you
don’ t
make
it
confusion
this
is
absolutely
clear
that
even
number
with
carboxylic
acid
group,
then
it
is
the
more
occurrence
in
nature,
but
odd
number
to
carboxylic
group
living
aside
the
carboxylic
group,
carboxylic
acid
group
that
if
that
be
there
then
that
is
more
occurrence,
more
occur
it
occurs
more
with
the
even
odd
number
right.
So,
if
you
leave
a
the
carboxylic
acid
group.
So,
even
or
odd
that
is
subjective,
so
until
and
unless
you
specify
don’ t
get
confused
right.
So,
even
number
fatty
acids
are
more
in
nature
than
those
for
odd
numbered
ones
then
comes
saturated
fatty
acids
right.
Now ,
out
of
these
fatty
acids
now
like
this
one
which
we
have
shown
let
me
erase
it
this
one,
now
you
suppose
we
have
carbon
like
this
carbon,
like
this
carbon,
like
this
go
on
right,
C
COOH
this
is
the
carboxylic
group
right.
Now ,
if
whether
all
of
them
are
with
hydrogen,
so
then
it
becomes
alkyl
right,
if
all
of
them
with
hydrogen
then
it
becomes
a
alkyl
group
whatever
be
the
name.
So,
if
out
of
that
one
is
replaced
if
out
of
that
no
not
the
this
one
see
out
of
that
if
one
is
replaced
with
a
double
bond
right,
then
it
becomes
unsaturated
because
unsaturated
means
there
has
to
be
a
double
bond,
if
there
is
a
single
unsaturation
then
single
double
bond.
If
there
are
multi
unsaturation
then
there
are
multi
double
bonds
available,
but
if
the
double
bond
is
not
there
as
in
the
earlier
case
we
have
shown
that
all
the
valencies
are
occupied
by
the
hydrogen.
Then
or
may
not
be
all
the
time
hydrogen
may
be
if
they
are
grouped
right.
I
show
that
also
can
be
so
depending
on
how
they
are
attached,
but
if
there
all
with
some
or
other
kind
of
valency
with
hydrogen
or
equivalent
substitution
then
they
are
saturated
right.
So,
then
we
call
it
to
be
saturated
carboxylic
acid,
now
this
saturated
carbolic
acid
when
it
reacts
with
the
alcohol
that
is
glycerol;
then
the
esters
which
are
formed
may
be
again
mono
saturated
mono
or
di
or
triglyceride
depending
on
how
the
how
many
number
of
alcohol
groups
are
esterified
right.
So,
between
C
2
fatty
acids
containing
from
2
to
80
carbon
atoms
per
molecules
are
known
in
most
animal
and
vegetable
fats
C
2
to
C
20
particularly
C
16
and
C
18
are
found,
saturated
fatty
acids
with
more
than
24
carbon
atoms
are
not
commonly
encountered
or
is
not
available
right.
Seldom
occur
in
food
triglyceride
beyond
that’ s
what
I
was
saying
that
though
theoretically
it
can
be
that
C
2
to
C
80
right.
Theoretically
it
can
be,
but
for
all
practical
purpose
those
which
are
available
in
nature
in
out
of
that
it
is
mostly
sin
that
between
2
to
20,
it
is
varying
and
that
too
it
is
also
said
where
C
16,
C
18
are
more
occurrent
in
nature
that
is
their
availability
in
nature
is
much
more.
But
beyond
C
4
24
it
is
seldomly
occurring
in
nature
artificially
you
can
do
anything
that
is
altogether
dif ferent
artificially
you
can
produce
anything
right.
Now
artificially
people
are
polymerizing
those
polymers
and
that
polymerization
you
can
do
as
much
you
can
polymerize
depending
on
the
dif ferent-dif ferent
products
are
coming
up,
every
now
and
then
somewhere
other
kind
of
polymers
coming
in
the
market,
but
they
are
all
manmade,
they
are
not
natural.So,
natural
this
polymers
or
rather
poly
chain
right
chain
of
this
carbons
in
the
fatty
acids;
They
are
between
2
to
20,
and
out
of
that
16
and
18
are
more
occurent
than
any
other
and
beyond
24
they
are
seldomly
sin
right,
but
do
so
in
waxes
yes
if
it
is
more
than
that
instead
of
fatty
acids
instead
of
esters
of
glycerol
or
glycerides
it
forms
wax
right.
W ax
is
also
kind
of
this
comes
under
the
lipid
family
right,
This
also
comes
under
the
lipid
family ,
but
there
are
the
number
of
carbon
atoms
are
more
than
24
and
they
are
high
chain
long
chain
carbon
atoms
and
they
forms
waxes
between
C
4
to
C
10
the
occur
mainly
in
milk
fat
such
as
butyric
acid,
the
their
as
you
see
we
are
giving
here
that
CH
3,
CH
2
C
whole
2
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
2
COOH
that
is
1
3
4
including
the
carboxylic
acid
it
is
4
butyric
acid
right.
Again
I
say
the
subsequently
at
some
point
you
may
say
that
without
the
carboxylic
acid
this
number
will
be
C
3
right.
So
again
and
again
this
confusion
you
don’ t
keep
you
have
to
be
very
specific
that
is
why
explicitly
I
have
given
the
formula
for
butyric
acid
with
C
4
right.
But
if
I
say
that
butyric
acid
is
C
3
then
it
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
COOH
is
omitted
right.
This
is
excluded
excluding
that
C
O
O
H
butyric
acid
is
C
3
right,
in
that
case
it
becomes
odd
number
right.
Though
it
corresponds
to
butyric
acid
which
is
including
the
carboxylic
acid
is
the
even
number
right.
So,
don’ t
make
confusion
you
have
to
be
specific
and
the
moment
you
are
specific
you
can
write
like
this
that
yes
butyric
acid
is
this.
Similarly ,
are
some
other
gaseous
like
capric
acid
that
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
force
COOH
that
is
4
and
1
5
and
then
COOH
that
is
6
it
was
4,
C
4
,8
C
6
caprylic
that
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
6
COOH
then
capric,
there
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
8
COOH
right.
So,
all
these
are
occurent
in
milk
all
these
are
fatty
acids
occurent
in
milk
between
C
4
to
C
10
between
C
12
to
C
24
are
found
mostly
in
most
vegetable
and
animal
fats.
So
milk
contains
mostly
between
smaller
chain
that
is
4
to
10,
12,
1
was
up
to
24
it
can
be
available
mainly
in
some
plant
origin
vegetables
or
may
be
some
animal
origin
fats.
So,
depending
on
that
whether
it
is
plant
origin
or
animal
origin
depending
on
that
this
number
also
may
vary
we
will
also
come
sometime
may
be
lard
that
is
1
which
is
a
animal
fat
and
the
price
of
animal
fat
is
much
much
lower
than
that
of
the
either
milk
or
vegetable
fat
right.
Much
much
lower
and
the
quality
is
also
much
much
lower
quality
in
the
sense
the
assimilability
in
the
body
and
the
consumer
is
much
much
lower
that
is
why
their
price
is
also
very
low
you
can
easily
see
if
you
go
to
any
slaughterhouse
write
lot
of
animal
fats
are
thereright.
And
those
animal
fats
either
been
thrown
away
or
people
buy
with
very
very
limited
money
a
very
small
I
mean
amount
of
money
they
buy
the
1
of
the
reasons
that
is
not
true
even
if
you
go
and
if
you
do
not
need
to
separate
fat
just
the
whole
milk
if
you
buy
is
much
much
higher
right.
Though
you
are
getting
along
with
milk
fat
you
are
getting
protein
and
carbohydrates
and
many
others,
but
if
it
is
separated
then
the
price
will
go
even
higher
much
more
higher
right.
So,
that
is
why
the
fats
are
in
milk
it
is
small
chain
carbon
between
C
4
to
C
10,
C
12
onwards
is
normally
available
in
vegetable
fats,
or
animal
fats.
Fatty
acids
with
odd
number
carbon
atoms
are
found
in
animal
and
vegetables
in
odd
numbers
that
odd
number
includes
this
COOH
right,
this
COOH
is
included
,
but
they
seldom
exceed
between
1
more
than
1
to
2
percent
of
the
total
fat
right.
The
total
fat
which
is
present
out
of
that
this
odd
numbers
are
only
around
1
to
2
percent.
It
is
mainly
the
even
and
this
even
one
is
including
the
carboxylic
acid
group,
and
the
odd
one
is
also
including
the
carboxylic
acid
group.
So,
the
odd
numbers
are
rarely
found
is
small
in
quantity
less
in
quantity
and
percentage
wise
as
we
said
that
is
around
1
to
2
percent
and
mostly
occurent
in
the
higher
of
course,
higher
carbon
chain
C
12
to
C
24,
that
is
available
in
plant
origin
and
animal
origin
fats
right.
The
common
saturated
acids
are
lauric
acid
which
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
10,
COOH
Myristic
acid
that
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
12
COOH,
Palmitic
acid
that
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
14,
COOH
stearic
acid
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
16
COOH
right.
So,
these
are
common
saturated
acids
which
are
there.Now ,
out
of
that
out
of
that
let
me
see
yeah,
so
perhaps
one
blank
came.
So,
out
of
that
we
saw
that
up
to
16
we
have
said
that
is
Palmitic
stearic
acid
right,
and
there
are
unsaturated
fatty
acids
also
and
these
unsaturated
fatty
acids
they
do
have
double
bonds
and
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
single
unsaturation
or
multiple
of
unsaturation
or
multiple
unsaturations
depending
on
that
they
are
also
name
dif ferently .
Like
you
might
have
heard
that
there
is
a
term
called
PUF A;
that
is
poly
unsaturated
fatty
acid,
you
will
see
in
many
advertisements
of
fats
and
oils
they
do
claim
that
it
is
a
having
very
unsaturated
fatty
acids.
And
by
the
by
that
many
this
unsaturated
fatty
acids
are
not
normally
synthesized
by
our
body
or
body
are
not
able
to
synthesize
that
is
why
from
the
external
sources
they
are
being
supply
that
is
why
the
advertisement
it
is
it
is
being
highlighted
that
this
contains
poly
unsaturated
fatty
acids
and
this
is
much
more
better
for
your
body
that
is
what
it
being
claim.
So,
what
is
that
unsaturated
fatty
acids
that
both
number
of
carbon
atoms
and
double
bonds
characterized
characterizes
this
right.
Though
there
the
double
bond
may
vary
between
1
to
6
right,
usually
1
is
there,
but
you
can
be
more
than
one
crop
to
maximum
6
are
naturally
occurring
unsaturated
fatty
acids
available
in
that
some
of
the
names
are
like
this
Myristic
acid
or
it
is
Myristoleic
acid
Myristoleic
acid
is
CH
3,
CH
2.
Myristoleic
acid
is
CH
3,
CH
2,CH3,
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
3
CH
double
bond
CH
C
H
2
whole
7
COOH
right.
So
from
the
left
from
the
carboxylic
acid
group
side
it
is
C8
where
the
between
C
8
and
C
9
the
double
bond
is
right,
this
is
number
1
and
from
their
7
8
and
this
is
9
so
9
and
10
sorry
this
is
7
8
9
and
10
between
that
it
is
Myristoleic
acid.
Similarly ,
in
Palmitic
acid
it
is
it
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
5,
CH
double
bond
CH
C
H
2
whole
7
C
O
O
H,
then
Oleic
acid
it
is
CH
3,
CH
2
whole
7
CH
double
bond
CH
C
H
2
whole
7
COOH
here
you
see
that
number
of
double
carbon
atom
where
double
bond
is
1
8
9
again
here
also
between
9
and
10,
here
also
between
9
and
10
right,
but
this
side
the
numbers
are
dif ferent
here
it
was
CH
C
H
2
whole
3,
here
it
is
CH
2
whole
5,
here
it
is
CH
2,
whole
7
right.
But
this
side
all
of
them
have
the
same
configuration
right.
Then
from
oleic
acid
if
we
go
it
is
Linoleic
acid
where
it
is
CH
3,
CH
2whole
4
CH
double
bond
CH
C
H
2
CH
double
bond
CH
C
H
2
whole
7
COOH
again
8
9
between
9
and
10
position
1
and
then
1 1
12
between
12
and
13
position
another .
So,
2
double
bonds
in
Linoleic
acid
right;
in
Linoleic
acid
2
double
bonds
are
there,
so
the
more
the
double
bonds
are
there
in
unsaturated
fatty
acids
better
it
is
because
it
acts
if
the
external
if
oxidation
is
there,
then
oxygen
can
easily
combine
in
this
double
bond.
So,
this
can
be
taken
by
one
oxygen
or
another
oxygen
or
may
not
be
oxygen,
but
some
other
substituted
product
that
can
come
up
right.
So,
there
we
can
see
that
between
C
9
and
C
10
1
double
bond
and
between
1 1
12
between
12
and
13
1
double
bond
in
Linoleic
acid
right.
Similarly
in
Linolenic
acid,
Linolenic
acid
it
is
CH
3,
CH
2
CH
double
bond
CH
whole
3,
then
CH
2
whole
7
COOH
So
1
methyl
group
outside
and
then
CH
2
CH
double
bond
CH
whole
3.
So,
there
are
3
such
groups
CH
2
CH
double
bond
CH
3
unsaturation
is
there
in
Linolenic
acid
right.
So,
3
unsaturation
in
Linolenic
acid
and
there
it
is
CH
2
CH
double
bond
CH
whole
3
is
associated
with
1
side
with
methyl
group
and
the
other
side
with
rest
of
the
rest
of
the
earlier
that
8
C
8
or
9.
COOH
then
CH
2
whole
7
and
then
CH
double
bond
right.
So,
that
1
7
8
and
1
9;
So
9
position
those
things
are
same
like
this
right,
like
this
1
right,
here
it
is
COOH
CH
2
whole
7
and
then
it
is
the
double
one
which
is
coming
here
at
right,
and
this
like
this
is
that
the
3.
So,
this
is
3
double
bonds
here
we
have
2
double
bonds
and
in
all
other
cases
this
is
single
double
bond.Then
a
typical
another
one
call
Arachidonic
acid
Arachidonic
acid
is
CH
there
CH
2
whole
3
CH
2
CH
double
bond
CH
whole
4
and
CH
2
whole
3
COOH
right.
This
is
quick
call
a
where
we
have
4
double
bond.
So
we
have
given
we
said
between
between
1
to
6
double
bonds
are
there
naturally
occurring
unsaturated
carboxylic
acid.
So
we
have
given
example
upto
4
if
you
have
given
5
and
6
it
would
have
been
much
much
more
complex.
So,
but
it
shows
that
the
higher
the
number
of
carbon
atoms
there
is
a
possibility
of
unsaturation
more
in
that
lower
number
of
carbon
atoms
like
C
4,
C
6,
C
8,
C
12,
C
10,
their
this
unsaturation
possibilities
are
less
because
you
have
to
have
stereo
Chemically
stable
the
compound
also
has
to
be
stereo
Chemically
stable
stereo
means
in
the
special
arrangement
that
that
compound
has
to
be
stable
right.
So,
in
this
another
information
I
would
like
to
share
in
this
class
that
Oleic
acid
where
which
is
available
Oleic
acid
is
this
right
Oleic
acid
which
is
available
in
olive
oil
in
olive
oil
around
75
percent
it
is
Oleic
acid,
around
60
to
80
percent
Linolenic
acid
is
in
saf flower
seed
oil
saf flower
seed
oil
contains
around
60
to
80
percent
Linolenic
acid,
Which
is
also
having
a
single
double
bond
and
around
around
75
percent
is
the
Oleic
acid
present
in
olive
oil,
and
in
you
will
see
nowadays
people
have
also
started
using
olive
oil
as
one
of
the
one
of
the
oil
cooking
oil
for
themselves.
Many
people
who
can
af ford
of
course,
olive
oil
is
a
costlier
much
much
costlier
than
normal
available
oil
or
vegetable
oils.
But
vegetable
also
are
nowadays
the
prices
are
going
up
and
we
see
here
that
Linoleic
acid
is
around
60
to
70
or
80
percent
available
in
some
of
the
vegetable
oil
like
saf flower
seed
oil
right.
So,
like
this
we
need
to
know
some
of
the
chemistry
otherwise
it
is
not
possible
to
follow
why
and
how
and
when
etcetera
all
this
w’ s
are
to
be
answered
right.
W e
will
continue
this
fat
in
the
next
class
also.
Thank
you.
