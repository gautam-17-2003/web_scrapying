Milk
Fat
(Contd.)
So,
we
were
discussing
about
that
Milk
Fat
and
while
doing
that,
we
said
we
will
also
try
to
give
some
chemistry
of
the
fat.
Otherwise,
it
may
be
dif ficult
to
understand
right.
So,
we
came
up
to
saturated
fatty
acid
saturated,
right.
Now ,
if
we
this
was
our
last
class,
now
from
the
saturation
if
we
go
to
unsaturation,
here
of
course,
some
of
the
things
have
gone
beyond.
So,
essential
fatty
acids
are
those
which
man
or
animals
cannot
synthesize,
for
example,
poly
unsaturated
fatty
acids
or
PUF A,
such
as
linoleic
acid.
In
earlier
class,
we
have
seen
that
depending
on
oleic
acid,
depending
on
linoleic
acid,
there
the
number
of
unsaturations
are
1
or
2
or
somewhere
it
was
3.
So,
linolenic
acid
is
one
such
where
it
is
double
bond,
2
doubles
ones
and
we
call
it
to
be
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
or
PUF A.
This
I
said
in
the
last
class
also
that
people
do
capitalize
their
advertisement
on
that
because,
this
unsaturated
fatty
acid
the
human
being
or
animals
they
are
not
able
to
synthesized
in
their
body
system.
So,
that
is
why
they
are
called
essential,
why
essential?
Because
they
are
not
being
synthesized
by
the
body;
so,
that
has
to
be
supplemented
externally ,
right.
And
that
is
the
keyword
which
the
oil
producers
dif ferent,
they
do
capitalize
the
advertising
that
they
have
polyunsaturated
fatty
acid
in
their
oil,
whatever
be
the
vegetable
oil
or
whatever
be
the
other
oil,
right.
And
you
if
you
remember
we
said
that
this
olive
oil
oleic
acid
which
is
also
a
unsaturated
fatty
acid,
that
do
contain
around
70
80
percent
in
the
olive,
right.
Whereas,
saw
flower
that
contains
around
60
to
80
percent
depending
on,
again
depending
on
what
is
the
source
of
saw
flower
where
from
it
is
coming,
where
it
is
grown
up,
how
the
processing
is
done,
all
factors
come
into
and
it
varies
between
60
to
80
percent
of
the
unsaturated
fatty
acid
available,
right.
Linolenic
acid
they
are,
but
we
call
polyunsaturated
PUF A
linolenic,
where
it
is
more
than
one
unsaturation
is
there,
right.
So,
normally
these
are
acyl
derivatives
of
glycerol,
right.
Where
this
is
the
glycerol
this
has
this
double
bonds,
right
not
double
bonds.
So,
this
cell
groups,
right.
This
is
mono,
this
is
di
and
this
is
tri,
right.
Are
you
remember
I
said
the
cell
group
to
be
that
COR,
sorry
COR,
right.
This
was
C
COR,
right.
This
is
the
unsaturation,
this
is
called
the
acyl
group,
and
this
R
can
be
anything,
right
So,
there
this
acyl
derivative
of
the
glycerol,
that
is
either
monglyride
or
diglyceride
or
triglyceride,
this
can
be
said
to
be
mono,
this
can
be
said
di
and
this
is
triglyceride,
right.
So,
with
this
basis
let
us
now
proceed
to
a
the
milk
fat,
right.
So,
if
we
look
into
that
milk
fat,
it
is
commonly
known
as
butter
fat,
milk
fat
is
commonly
known
as
butter
fat.
And
generally ,
it
is
varying
between
say
2.5
to
6
percent,
could
be
lower ,
could
be
higher
depending
on
the
source
again,
depending
on
the
source,
depending
on
the
species
etcetera,
this
may
vary .
But
for
simplicity
to
have
the
idea
to
make
it
general,
we
call
it
around
3
to
6
percent,
right.
2.5
is
also
a
odd
number ,
3
to
6
percent
generally
we
call
that
fat
content
in
milk,
right.
Because
cow
milk
contains
less,
buf falo
milk
contains
more,
that
we
have
seen
in
the
earlier
class,
right.
And
so,
3
to
6
percent
is
the
commonly
milk
contents
fat.
Now ,
these
fat
molecules
are
this
fat
of
course,
they
are
not
said
molecules,
they
are
said
globules
because,
they
are
like
this.
So,
this
is
a
fat
globule,
right
and
in
this
globule,
there
is
a
fat
globule
membrane.
So,
this
membrane
is
there
and
that
is
called
FGM
or
fat
globule
membrane.
So,
it
is
made
of
approximately
98
percent
triglyceride,
0.2
percent
to
1
percent
phospholipids
and
0.2
to
0.4
percent
sterols.
Phospholipids
and
proteins
are
mostly
associated
with
the
FGM;
that
is,
the
that
is
the
milk
this
is
fat
globule
membrane.
So,
this
fat
globule
membrane
contents
phospholipids
and
proteins
mainly .
And
in
milk
fat
it
is
around
98
percent
triglyceride
0.2
to
1
percent
phospholipids,
and
0.2
to
0.4
percents
sterols
in
the
milk
fat,
right.
Now ,
if
we
get
around
18
to
25
percent
fat
so,
that
fat
is
called
single
cream
or
cof fee
cream
or
light
cream
or
table
cream
so,
any
name
that
can
be
between
18
to
25
percent.
So,
not
less
than
30
percent
they
are
called
light
whipping.
So,
whipping
I
remember
that
it
is
coming
to
my
mind,
now
that
I
had
said
it
that
whipping
means
when
you
are
incorporating
air ,
right.
Like
when
you
are
doing
omelette
and
other
things
with
egg,
that
time
you
do
stir
it,
and
during
the
stirring
what
you
are
doing?
Y ou
are
incorporating
air
into
it
that
is
why
it
is
becoming
fluf fy .
Otherwise
omelette
just
like
that
you
try
one
day ,
without
fluf fy
without
doing
that
we
just
put
it.
And
do
that
with
omelette
or
whatever
we
call
that
if
you
make
their
the
thickness
will
be
very ,
very
less,
whereas,
if
you
do
the
stirring
you
will
see
that
it
has
become
a
little
more
fluf fy .
The
same
quantity ,
but
it
appears
to
be
more
so,
that
is
why
it
is
more
lucrative
and
more
may
not
be
by
nutritive
value
you
are
changing
anything,
but
the
esthetic
value
of
the
food
you
are
changing.So,
that
is
where
the
this
your
are
this
thing
is
whipping
is
very
much
required
right.
So,
in
that
sense,
if
it
is
less
than
30
percent,
then
it
is
called
light
whipping,
if
it
is
more
than
not
less
than
36
percent,
then
it
is
called
heavy
whipping,
and
if
it
is
more
than
60
to
80
percent,
then
that
is
called
plastic
or
extra
heavy
cream,
right.
Similarly ,
butter
contains
around
82.5
percent
plus
minus
82.5
percent
cream,
and
butter
oil
contains
not
less
than
98
to
99.5
percent
fat.
Cheddar
cheese
contains
around
30
to
40
percent
fat,
ice
cream
around
8
to
20
percent,
evaporated
milk
not
less
than
8
percent,
and
whole
milk
contains
26
percent.
Now ,
all
this
exist
in
milk
in
the
form
of
minute
globules,
right.
Just
in
the
previous
slide
I
have
shown,
minute
globule.
So,
in
a
true
this
is
a
true
emulsion
of
oil
in
water ,
O
W ,
oil
in
water
true
emulsion;
where
the
emulsion
means
there
is
a
continuous
phase
and
there
is
dispersed
phase.
The
continuous
phase
is
one
which
is
more
in
quantity;
that
is,
continuous
phase,
in
this
case
water
is
the
more
quantity
more
quantity
wise
component,
and
in
that
the
oil
or
fat
is
there
that
is
way
it
is
called
oil
in
water .
Similarly ,
in
butter
it
is
the
reverse
where
is
more
component
is
the
fat
that
is
80
to
83
percent,
less
quantity
is
water .
So,
that
is
called
that
is
called
water
in
oil,
right.
One
is
O
W
and
another
is
W
O
emulsion,
ok.
Each
globule
of
fat
is
surrounded
by
a
very
thin
film
of
protein
or
the
serum
of
milk,
that
is
concentrated
on
the
surface
and
held
in
place
by
surface
attracting
or
some
absorption
material.
By
either
surface
attracting
material
or
by
absorption,
if
this
is
there;
The
concentrated
layer
surrounded
the
fat
globule
is
composed
of
certain
protein
and
fat
like
substances,
especially ,
that
is
called
lecithin,
and
the
other
day
I
said
about
lecithin
the
story
of
the
saas
bahu
I
said
now
I
remember
hopefully
here
we
are
finished
up
ok.
So,
milk
fat
that
contains
traces
of
fatty
acids,
some
vitamins
like
A
D
E
K,
and
some
enzymes,
right.
More
than
400
dif ferent
fatty
acids
of
which
predominance
are,
there
are
more
than
400
fatty
acids,
right.
Now
as
we
have
seen
fatty
acids
can
be
of
anything
which
are
bigger
carbon
right.
So,
more
than
400;
obviously ,
in
your
mind
it
may
come,
sir
I
said
long
chain
fatty
acid
short
chain
fatty
acids
there
is
a
true,
2
to
80
carbon
number
of
carbons,
right
are
you
said
their
naturally
occurring.
But
predominantly
between
2
to
20,
beyond
20
or
24
it
is
in
the
family
of
waxes.
In
the
lipid
family
it
maybe
even
higher
right.
So,
400
dif ferent
fatty
acids
are
there,
now
this
fatty
acid
suppose
one
fatty
acid
is
like
this.
Y ou
see,
this
is
one
carbon,
this
is
and
the
2
hands,
this
is
the
third
hand,
right
and
this
is
the
forth
hand.
So,
if
this
is
with
one
carboxylic
acid,
right.
If
this
is
with
one
methyl
group,
this
is
one
methyl
group,
this
is
one
methyl
group,
then
that
can
be
how
many?
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
right;
Or
if
it
is
CH
instead
of
CH
3
if
it
is
instead
of
CH
3
this
is
the
eraser .
So,
if
we
make
it
like
this
that
if
it
is
CH
2
CH
3,
right.
This
group
you
put
so
that
1,
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
6
membered
right.
So,
after
that
butyric
we
have
said
that
was
to
my
memory
it
is
either
capric
capric
acid
to
my
memory
right.
So,
there
either
capric
caprylic
hopefully
capric
acid.
So,
there
it
is
C
6,
but
that
was
straight
chain1
2
3
4
5
and
then
COOH,
right.
So,
these
was
straight,
but
here
it
can
be
like
this.
So,
how
the
stereo
chemically
they
are?
So,
depending
on
that
dif ferent
fatty
acids
though
same
number ,
dif ferent
fatty
acids
could
be
there,
that
is
why
though
we
said
C
2
to
C80
so,
automatically
it
come.
So,
there
should
not
be
more
than
70,
80
numbers
of
fatty
acids,
but
it
is
not
so.
This
is
in
a
in
numerable.
So,
that’ s
why
you
are
saying
that
more
than
400
dif ferent
fatty
acids
are
predominantly
in
milk
fat,
out
of
which
are
in
milk
fat
out
of
which
predominance
are
myristic
acid
which
is
C
4,
with
0
that
is
no
double
bond.
Palmitic
acid
with
C
16
with
no
double
bound;
Stearic
acid
with
C
18
no
double
bond,
and
oleic
acid
with
C
18
with
single
double
bond,
right.
So,
around
400
dif ferent
fatty
acids
are
there
in
milk,
right.
Predominance
are
C
14,
16,
18
with
single
or
no
double
or
saturated,
right
they
are
predominant,
ok.
Then
lipids,
proteins,
cerebrosides,
nucleic
acids,
enzyme,
trace
elements,
minerals,
trace
elements
like
minerals
some
bound
water
stabilize
and
prevent
fat
globule
from
coalescence
during
milk
processing
and
handling.
So,
all
these
factors
like
presence
of
lipids
presence
of
proteins
than
the
cerebroside,
nucleic
acid
enzyme,
trace
quantity
of
minerals
or
elements
some
bound
water ,
these
stabilize
that
is
the
primary ,
these
stabilized
and
prevent
milk
fat
globules
to
coalescence.
Coalescence
means
coming
together
and
burning.
Now ,
I
remember
I
said
that
the
thermometer
breaking
and
getting
that
mercury
droplets
or
globules,
and
when
they
are
coming
together ,
they
are
they
are
agglomerating.
So,
this
is
also
a
kind
of
agglomeration
of
the
fat
globules.
And
these
prevents
those
fat
globules
to
come
and
close
come
close
and
form
the
bigger
molecule
right.
So
now ,
let
us
go
perhaps
we
had
we
are
said.Now ,
FGM
this
prevents
attack
from
the
lipase
of
subsequently
when
we
will
go
to
other
constituents
of
milk,
there
will
see
that
there
are
n
number
of
enzymes
present
in
milk.
N
number
of
enzymes
are
present
in
milk,
right.
In
many
occasions
I
am
saying
that
in
our
saliva,
the
it
also
contains
lot
many
numbers
of
enzymes,
that
to
it
activates
it
comes
when
you
are
chewing,
that
is
why
you
are
asked
you
are
said
that
do
not
grab
the
food,
you
chew
and
the
during
this
chewing
that
saliva
secretion
is
in
secreting
enzymes,
right.
So,
milk
contains
naturally
many
numbers
of
enzymes,
one
such
enzyme
is
lipase.
Now ,
lipases
is
one
and
any
enzyme
by
this
time
hopefully
you
know ,
as
I
am
saying
that
has
when
things
are
coming
I
am
trying
to
explain
a
little
more.
So,
enzyme
their
name
as
a
s
e,
any
enzyme
is
ending
with
a
s
e
right?
So,
like
lipase,
lipase
right
so,
would
lipase
means
the
enzyme
which
is
acting
on
the
lipid,
right.
Lipid
was
the
bigger
umbrella
in
which
fat
is
also
there.
So,
enzymes
which
act
on
lipids
are
called
lipase,
right.
So,
this
fat
global
membranes,
they
do
protect
the
fat
from
the
action
of
the
lipase.
Otherwise,
otherwise
these
fat
molecules
since
lipase
enzyme
is
there
it
will
see
it’ s
food
is
their ,
food
is
that
fat
so,
fat
is
there.
So,
go
it
goes
and
breaks,
that
is
what
it
is
it
is
work.
So,
wherever
free
fats
are
like
that
available,
then
go
and
break
it,
that’ s
the
lipase
enzymes
activity .
But
it
is
not
able
to
because,
the
globule
is
already
protected
by
the
fat
global
membrane,
which
is
we
have
said
that
some
protein
some
lipoproteins
and
some
enzymes
are
also
there,
right.
So,
free
fatty
acids
are
fairly
soluble
in
water ,
and
are
situated
in
milk
plasma,
and
fat
free
fatty
acids
are
fairly
soluble
in
water ,
and
are
situated
in
milk
plasma
and
fat,
right.
Short
chain
fatty
acids
situated
in
the
milk
plasma
are
ionized
and
are
more
water
soluble
than
long
chain
free
fatty
acids,
where
this
long
chain
is
more
than
carbon
number
14,
right;
If
this
long
chains
are
more
than
carbon
number
14’ s.
Minerals
associated
with
the
fat
globule
membrane
are
copper ,
generally
between
5
to
25
percent,
iron
between
30
to
60
percent.
Other
minerals
include
cobalt,
calcium,
sodium,
potassium,
magnesium,
manganese,
molybdenum
and
zinc,
they
are
also
present.
W e
will
come
more
in
detail
about
when
we
are
talking
about
the
minerals
content
in
milk,
right.
Now ,
compound
lipids
also
occurred
in
milk
such
as
phospholipids
and
phosphatides,
right.
Phospholipids
or
phosphatides,
that
are
situated
mainly
in
the
fat
globule
membranes,
but
also
in
milk
plasma
lipoproteins
and
milk
micro
microsomes
it
is
present.
Phospholipids
and
phosphatides
are
highly
surface
active
and
polar
and
dissolve
poorly
in
both
water
and
oil,
right.
Lipids
can
be
crystallized
which
af fects
fat
structure
melting
range
rheological
properties
of
milk,
right.
So,
these
lipids
can
be
crystallized
which
af fects
that
lipid
content
in
milk
that
af fects,
the
fat
structure
of
the
fat
melting
point
of
the
fat,
or
melting
range
of
the
fat,
then
rheological
properties
of
the
fat.
Obviously
rheological
property
how
in
which
the
viscosity
comes
primarily
in
into
the
picture,
right;
Autoxidation,
that
is
autoxidation
where
it
is
oxidation
by
itself
of
the
double
bond
containing
fatty
acids
or
fatty
acid
residues
can
occur
leading
to
of f
flavours.
Now ,
if
there
are
lipids
present
in
milk,
not
if
milk
contains
lot
of
lipids.
So,
this
lipids
may
under go
auto
oxidation,
and
of
course,
this
oxidation
will
come
subsequently
in
more
in
detail,
right.
So,
there
this
autoxidation
may
produce
of f
flavour
in
the
milk,
which
is
of
course,
not
desirable,
right.
Then
we
come
to
this
that
whole
milk
contains
about
10
to
20
milligram
per
100-gram
milk
cholesterol.
So,
10
to
20
milligram
cholesterol
per
100
gram
of
milk,
that
is
around
and
where
milk
is
around
3-point
3
percent,
right.
Fat
amount
of
cholesterol
is
positively
correlated
with
the
amount
of
fat
present
in
the
product
or
in
this
case
milk,
right.
Obviously
if
the
fat
content
is
low ,
then
the
cholesterol
content
also
will
be
low ,
if
the
fat
content
is
high,
the
cholesterol
content
also
will
be
high,
that
is
why
it
is
said
10
to
20
milligram,
though
the
number
is
10
and
20
not
so
big,
but
in
milligram
per
100
gram
of
milk
so,
that
is
not
very
very
small,
right.
If
you
convert
it
in
terms
of
ppm
it
will
also
be
a
good
in
number
right
so,
ppm
means
parts
per
million
right.
So,
gram
and
milligram
is
10
to
the
power
3.
So,
when
it
comes
to
10
to
the
power
6,
then
it
comes
to
ppm,
right.
So,
this
you
convert
and
see,
that
it
is
several
100’ s
or
1000’ s
of
ppm
that
10
to
20
milligram,
right.
And
cholesterol
is
located
in
the
globule
membrane
and
approximately
10
percent
of
the
cholesterol
is
esterified.
Approximately
10
percent
of
the
cholesterol
is
esterified,
right.
Because
cholesterol
so,
with
O
L,
I
ending
with
O
L
anything
O
L
ending
with
O
L
normally
is
hydroxyl
having
hydroxylic
group,
right.
Hydroxyl
group
is
associated
with
the
naming
of
that
ending
with
O
L.
So,
cholesterol
is
such;
that
means,
there
is
also
hydroxyl
group
present,
the
moment
hydroxyl
group
is
there.
So,
there
are
fatty
acids
so,
this
free
fatty
acids
will
come
and
join
with
the
cholesterol,
they
are
by
binding
them
in
and
the
form
of
ester ,
right.
That’ s
what
it
is
sin
that
around
10
percent
of
the
cholesterol
is
esterified,
and
this
cholesterol
are
located
in
the
globular
membrane,
that
outside
putting
of
the
fat
globule
in
that
fat
globule
outside
membrane
is
the
cholesterol
present.
And
that
is
generally
10
percent
is
esterified.
Now ,
size
of
the
fat
global,
it
varies
between
2
to
30
microns,
we
said
earlier
also.
So,
the
lower
the
size,
more
is
the
number ,
the
higher
is
the
size,
less
is
the
number ,
right.
Because
biggest
size
will
have
less
in
number ,
smaller
size
will
have
much
more
in
number ,
right.
And
in
one
class
we
said,
that
this
fat
globules
can
be
seen
also
in
the
microscope
that
they
with
glycerol
as
the
medium,
then
they
will
be
this
globules
will
be
dancing,
right.
And
please
tell
me
that
this
by
which
law
this
can
be
said,
right.
This
is
the
free
movement
of
the
fat
globules.
I
gave
this
as
the
hint,
single
drop
of
milk
contains
about
10
to
the
power
8,
right.
100,
000,
000;
So,
10
to
the
power
8
number
of
fat
globules
are
single
drop,
single
drop
and
one
drop
is
how
much?
One
drop
normally
we
say
a
drop
which
comes
out
from
pipette
or
burette,
that
drop
is
around
0.05
m
l;
So,
0.05
m
l,
these
contents
10
to
the
power
8
number
of
fat
globules.
Now ,
imagine
that
1
litre,
half
litre
how
many
numbers
of
fat
globules
will
be
there,
right.
And
that
is
why
more
and
more
we
are
saying
about
the
stability
of
the
fat,
that
one
it
is
stabilized
by
that
lecithin
as
a
emulsion,
then
the
fat
global
membrane;
that
is,
where
cholesterol
is
also
playing
an
active
role
as
it
is
also
part
which
is
forming
in
the
membrane.
And
this
10
percent
of
the
cholesterol
is
also
getting
esterified
with
the
free
fatty
acids,
right.
So,
with
this
our
time
is
over
now .
Let
us
come
and
next
again
will
continue
with
the
composition
of
the
milk
fat.
So,
many
things
are
there
to
know ,
so
many
and
we
will
we
will
definitely
we
will
definitely
cover
as
much
as
possible
a
both
in
terms
of
chemistry
as
well
as
the
physics
of
the
entire
thing.
Because
this
is
the
one
which
we
need
to
understand;
And
ones
we
are
then
any
kind
of
processing,
we
will
be
much
better
of f
than
corresponding
may
be
mechanical
or
chemical
people,
who
may
not
be
doing
inside
of
it
so
much,
right.
Thank
you.
