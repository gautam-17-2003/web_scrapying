Types
of
Available
Milk
So,
in
our
this
food
Dairy
and
Food
Products
Process
and
Products
Technology
this
is
our
forty
eighth
class
right
and
we
will
discuss
today
on
milk
of
course,
that
is
the
base;
milk
is
available
in
the
market
in
different
forms.
Liquid
milk
as
what
you
get
every
day
that
we
have
dealt
with
elaborately
that
pasteurized,
homogenized
milk
which
you
get,
everything
we
have
said;
now
we
should
know
also;
so
what
some
other
types
of
milk
which
are
available
in
the
market
right?
So,
let
us
look
into
that.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
01:13)
And
for
that
different
milks
which
are
available
in
the
market,
we
can
say
that
raw
milk
which
is
available
as
fresh,
unpasteurized
milk
straight
from
the
cow,
which
we
use
to
get.
I
do
not
know
how
many
of
you
have
gone
to
different
milkman
and
different
milking
places,
but
in
our
childhood
we
had
no
other
option
other
than
going
to
those
milk
man
and
we
used
to
get
it
directly
from
the
cow
there.
So,
that
is
the
one
which
is
even
I
am
not
saying
it
is
not
true
in
urban,
but
in
rural
definitely
it
is
still
there
right.
In
rural
India
it
is
definitely
still
there,
that
people
are
going
directly
and1
buying
milk
from
the
milkman,
straight
away
from
the
cow.
So,
that
is
the
one
major
part
that
is
unorganized
sector ,
but
still
huge
volume
of
milk
is
utilized
or
is
being
supplied
by
the
rural
folk
right.
So,
another
one
is
the
whole
milk,
which
contains
no
less
than
3.25%
milk
fat.
So,
minimum
3.25%
milk
fat
the
other
they
we
said
if
you
remember ,
that
milk
is
priced
based
on
the
fat
content
primarily
based
on
the
fat
content
milk
is
priced
right.
Therefore,
whole
milk,
which
we
refer
to,
is
the
milk,
which
contains
3.25%
milk
fat.
It
must
also
contain
not
less
than
8.25
%
solid
not
fat
SNF
right
this
SNF
must
be
again
not
less
than
8.25%
almost
whole
milk
marketed
is
also
fortified
with
vitamin.
Nowadays
when
you
get
milk,
when
it
is
in
the
market
you
will
see
that
it
is
fortified.
Fortification
means
adding
externally
for
the
good
cause
right.
That
can
be
with
vitamin
that
can
be
with
minerals,
that
can
be
with
protein
or
that
can
be
with
anything.
So,
anything
which
you
are
adding
for
the
good
cause
for
the
good
health,
for
the
betterment
of
the
product
we
improve
the
product
selling
to
improve
the
product
not
only
quality ,
but
its
value
then
it
is
called
fortification.
So,
now,
a
days
you
get
also
may
fortified
milk
and
primarily
with
vitamins
fortified
vitamin
A
or
vitamin
D
they
are
fortified.
Then
low
fat
milk
which
has
sufficient,
milk
fat
to
remove
to
bring
the
levels
of
0.5
and
2%
right.
So,
low
milk
fat
this
also
has
different
names.
So,
we
said
0.5
or
2%
as
it
is
available
in
the
market.
It
also
contains
at
least
8.25%
solid
not
fat
and
it
must
also
contain
around
2000
IU
of
vitamin
A
per
kg
of
milk
that
is
also
mandatory
right.
Vitamin
A
is
added
to
offset
is
loss
caused
by
the
removal
of
some
of
the
fat;
because
vitamin
A
and
D
they
are
fat
soluble
right.
So,
and
milk
contains
enough,
I
mean
good
quantity
of
vitamins
both
A
and
D.
So,
if
e
is
it
is
particularly
A,
if
it
is
removed
if
the
fat
is
removed
then
along
with
fat,
this
vitamin
is
also
removed
from
the
milk.
So,
that
is
why
externally
this
vitamin
A
is
added
to
the
tune
of
third
1000IU
so,
that
the
loss
of
vitamin
is
compensated
due
to
the
they
when
you
are
removing
the
fat,
that
then
this
vitamin
fortification
can
remove
the
loss
of
vitamin
right.
2(Refer
Slide
Time:
07:08)
So,
you
can
find
milk
in
this
category
leveled,
they
are
one
low
fat,
2%
milk;
3
one
personal
milk
and
this
low
fat
could
be
0.5%
milk
right
which
we
have
already
said
right.
So,
there
is
for
low
fat
milk;
another
one
is
skim
milk
which
is
available,
and
this
is
also
contained
this
is
also
called
nonfat
milk
right
and
it
has
sufficient
milk
fat
remove
to
bring
the
level
to
the
tune
of
0.5%
of
fat.
It
also
should
contained
8.25%
solid
not
fat
and
must
be
fortified
with
vitamin
A.
This
is
also
mandatory
by
the
regulations
of
the
milk
authority ,
this
kind
of
definitions
are
introduced
otherwise
anybody
can
sell
anything.
So,
you
have
you
have
remove
fat.
So,
you
have
removed
to
vitamins
fat
soluble
vitamins.
So,
your
depriving
the
customer .
So,
that
you
cannot
deprived
customer ,
the
authority
regulatory
authorities
they
have
made
this
mandatory
or
this
kind
of
cap
on
the
on
the
on
the
vitamin
or
solid
not
fat
or
fat
content
of
the
of
the
milk
right.
So,
skim
milk
case
like
that.
Then
some
other
milk
like
chocolate
milk
right;
obviously ,
from
the
name
chocolate
milk,
it
is
appear
that
you
must
have
chocolate
fortification
or
chocolate
addition
right
so,
that
the
flavor
test
could
be
similar
to
the
chocolate.
So,
that
is
the
chocolate
milk
in
many
countries,
this
is
popular
right.
So,
this
is
made
by
adding
chocolate
or
cocoa
and
sweetener
to
2%
milk
that
is
why
that
we
said
different
milk.
So,
this
2%
milk
is
used
for
chocolate
milk
right.
So,
you
adding
externally
chocolate
or
cocoa
so,
that
you
get
the
chocolate
flavored
milk.
3
It
must
to
be
fortified
also
with
vitamin
A
and
addition
of
vitamin
D
is
optional.
Since
you
are
during
fat
again
you
supplement
the
vitamins
with
externally
addition
externally
adding
vitamin
A
and
vitamin
D
you
are
supplementing
the
loss,
you
are
compensating
the
loss
due
to
the
removal
of
fat,
because
you
are
brought
down
fat
content
to
2%
and
then
you
have
added
chocolate
or
cocoa
and
so,
vitamin
A
and
D
either
vitamin
A
only
or
vitamin
A
and
D.
If
you
D
is
optional,
but
A
is
not
optional,
A
is
a
mandatory
right
that
has
to
be
added
for
chocolate
milk
right.
(Refer
Slide
Time:
11:10)
Then
eggnog
right
this
is
another
name
eggnog
right.
So,
this
eggnog
says
that
it
is
a
mixture
of
milk,
egg,
sugar
and
cream.
So,
all
four
together
milk,
egg,
sugar
and
cream
they
are
in
combination
forming
the
eggnog.
And
this
it
may
be
also
contain
added
flavor
such
as
rum
extract
or
nutmeg
or
vanilla.
So,
depending
on
who
is
liking
which
flavor .
So,
these
are
the
flavors
which
may
be
added
like
rum
extract
or
nutmeg
or
vanilla
to
this
right.
So,
basically
it
is
the
that
eggnog
is
combination
of
milk,
egg,
sugar
and
cream
along
with
flavoring
compound
or
flavoring
materials
like
extract
from
the
rum
or
maybe
from
nutmeg
or
maybe
from
vanilla
these
are
added
externally
so,
that
the
flavor
is
according
to
the
choice
or
liking
of
the
customer .
So,
its
seasonal
product
and
most
readily
available
during
holidays
right;
so
depending
on
liking
area
etcetera
typically
in
developed
countries
because
their
choices
are
many
so
that
is
4
why
though
we
are
we
do
not
see
in
our
country
so,
much
other
than
in
typical
cities
in
big
cities
another ,
a
grade
cities
typical.
So,
you
may
get
it
is
not
of
course,
can
be
said
in
particularly
that
you
will
get,
but
it
is
the
available
in
our
country
also
where
because
it
depends
on
the
test
and
liking
of
the
people
right.
All
over
the
world
definitely
you
are
food
habits,
food
liking
are
I
mean
human
dependent
on
human
right
it
is
not
necessarily
that
what
you
like
has
to
be
liked
by
me
or
what
I
like
has
to
be
liked
by
you
that
is
why
so,
many
varieties
so,
many
things
I
have
been
developed
all
over
the
world
right
this
is
one
such
eggnog.
Then
nonfat
dry
milk
right
from
the
word
nonfat
dry
milk
dry
of
course
that
means
moisture
is
not
there
it
is
dried
and
non
fat
that
is
you
have
already
removed
the
fat
that
is
skim.
So,
nonfat
dry
milk
is
another
one
which
is
that
dried
skim
milk
also
it
can
be
called.
So,
is
the
product
obtained
by
removal
of
water
only
from
the
pasteurized
skim
milk?
So,
pasteurized
skim
milk
pasteurization
here
is
required,
because
you
have
killed
all
the
pathogen
and
during
drying
process.
So,
there
could
be
some
more
killing
of
the
organisms,
but
pathogen
killing
has
to
be
ensured
that
is
why
pasteurization
is
minimum
that
you
have
done
pasteurization
and
skim
milk
is
the
basis
from
which
you
are
making
it
right;
then
buttermilk.
So,
this
is
another
which
is
buttermilk
made
by
adding
a
special
bacterial
culture,
to
milk
to
produce
desirable
acidity ,
desirable
body ,
desirable
flavor
and
desirable
aroma
characteristic
of
the
product
right.
That
is
the
characteristic
of
the
product
buttermilk
which
you
are
getting
from
fermentation
by
adding
some
culture
right
known
culture,
which
you
know
that
this
will
develop
this
much
of
acidity
and
the
body
will
be
like
this,
flavor
and
the
aroma
will
be
this.
So,
you
can
tell
that
to
be
a
special
bacterial
culture
is
added
to
the
milk
to
produce
the
acidity ,
body
flavor
aroma
of
the
characteristic
product
that
is
the
buttermilk.
5(Refer
Slide
Time:
17:00)
So,
this
concentrate
is
the
is
then
homogenized
you
have
mix
them
and
we
have
cultured,
then
it
is
homogenized
and
then
fortified
with
vitamin
D,
packed
in
cans
sealed
and
then
sterilized
by
heat
right.
So,
your
canning
and
sterilizing.
I
do
not
know
whether
I
have
told
you
earlier ,
I
do
not
remember
if
I
had
told
then
a
reputation,
but
I
cannot
stop
telling
since
it
has
come.
Canning
is
such
a
product
is
such
a
process,
it
is
not
only
in
milk
not
only
in
liquid
food,
but
also
in
solid
foods
many .
You
might
have
seen
canned
juices,
you
might
have
seen
canned
pineapples,
canned
mango
canned
rasgulla
these
are
available
in
the
market.
Now ,
this
canning
is
altogether
have
different
industry ,
where
the
cans
are
basically
I
remember
I
had
told
quickly
that
from
different
sheets
right
from
different
sheets,
metal
sheets
they
are
made
and
the
cans
depending
on
your
size
whether
it
is
half
kg
or
one
kg
according
to
that,
the
volume
is
taken
up
and
there
is
no
welding
or
there
is
no
sealing.
This
sealing
is
done
by
the
seaming
this
process
is
called
seaming.
That
you
have
taken
sheet
and
that
sheet
you
have
made
a
fold
like
this
I
hope
I
had
said
like
this,
another
sheet
you
have
taken
I
made
a
fold
like
this.
So,
you
have
too
such
and
then
this
you
have
made
this
is
one
right
this
is
one
and
this
is
another .
So,
this
four
you
have
made
like
this
and
now
pressed.
So,
which
some
pressing
element
you
have
pressed.
So,
all
these
four
layers
1,
2,
3,
4
the
all
these
four
layers
and
then
pressed
and
it
becomes
leak
proof,
that
is
the
uniqueness
of
the
tin
can
rather
right.
Can
6
containers
are
never
sealed
with
welding
or
any
other
heat
sealing
method,
this
is
exactly
like
that
and
by
seaming
this
is
done
and
products
are
inside.
It
is,
nice
that
there
is
no
usually ,
I
am
not
saying
abnormally
the
usually
there
is
no
way
that
externally
something
we
will
come
in
or
from
internal
something
we
will
go
out
right
and
you
have
seen
that
this
cans
are
available
for
years
together
may
be
one
year,
two
year
there
is
there
is
no
such
limitation
that
within
such
and
such
type
this
has
to
be
right.
Though,
in
absence
it
is
a
mandatory ,
when
you
are
selling
a
product
in
an
enclosure
so
that
enclosure
must
have
the
date
of
manufacture
and
date
of
expiry .
So,
expiry
will
be
written,
but
generally
it
is
many
years
or
couple
of
years
right
ok.
So,
that
is
how
these
sterilized
and
canned
things
are
available
right.
Then
sweetened
condensed
milk;
sweetened
condensed
milk
is
another
item
which
is
a
canned
whole
milk
concentrate
prepared
by
evaporating
enough
water
under
vacuum
from
fresh
whole
milk,
it
reduce
the
volume
by
half.
From
fresh
whole
milk
the
volume
of
the
milk
is
reduced
roughly
to
the
half,
that
is
what
the
concentration
is
made
right.
So,
whatever
you
had
the
volume
is
made
to
half
and
this
concentrated
be
prepared
by
evaporation
and
enough
quantity
of
water
is
removed
under
vacuum
right.
This
is
sweetened
condensed
milk,
it
is
pasteurized
and
sugar
is
added
to
prevent
spoilage.
So,
in
this
case
sugar
acts
as
the
as
the
preservative;
sugar
acts
as
the
preservative.
So,
sugar
is
added
and
that
is
why
it
is
sweetened
also
its
preserves
both
the
purposes.
(1)
it
is
sweetening
and
(2)
it
is
acting
as
the
preservative
right
and
original
milk
is
boiled
of
or
rather
the
moisture
is
remove
the
level
of
50%
right
is
made
to
half
that
is
what
you
said
right.
So,
this
way
and
it
is
pasteurized
it
is
pasteurized
because
pasteurization
is
a
must
to
ensure
the
removal
of
all
the
pathogen
right.
Then
whipping
cream,
there
are
different
forms
different
names
of
creams
available
in
the
different
named
and
the
fat
contains
are
also
different.
So,
there
those
are
that
this
whole
milk
this
is
from
the
whole
milk
heavy
cream
that
contains
a
minimum
of
36
percent
fat
right
is
minimum
of
36%
fat
in
the
cream.
Then
light
whipping
cream
that
contains
around
30
to
36%
fat
right
light
whipping
cream
that
also
contains
around
30
to
36%
fat.
So,
heavy
cream
is
around
minimum
36%
or
more
and
light
whipping
is
30
to
36%.
So,
depending
on
the
fat
content
there
naming
are
also
different
right.
7(Refer
Slide
Time:
24:37)
Then
half
and
half
right
blend
of
milk
and
cream,
this
is
called
half
and
half
blend
of
milk
and
cream
that
is
10
to
12
percent
fat.
This
contains
10
to
12
percent
that
is
half
of
right
half
and
half
the
blend
of
milk
and
cream,
which
contains
10
to
12
percent
fat.
So,
fat
content
is
very
high
you
know
generally
in
ice
cream
ice
cream
is
also
called
heavy
fat
that
is
why
all
over
the
world.
Nowadays,
since
we
have
become
very
much
causes
and
the
fat
content
of
the
ice
cream
also
reduced
by
generally
ice
cream
also
do
content
around
10
to
12
percent
fatso
that
is
heavy
fat.
So,
half
of
that
is
why
it
is
called
half
and
half
is
a
blend
of
milk
and
the
cream,
which
to
together
forms
10
to
12%
of
the
fat
right.
Then
sour
cream,
which
has
18
percent
fat
this
is
very
high
fat
18
percent
fat
and
is
cream
is
and
is
cream
that
has
been
soured
by
lactic
acid
bacteria
right.
So,
already
you
have
lot
of
fat
and
it
is
also
sour.
So,
the
souring
has
been
made
by
incorporating
or
inoculating;
this
is
the
world
inoculating
lactic
acid
forming
bacteria
and
this
inoculum
that
is
lactic
acid
forming
bacteria
makes
the
milk
sour,
which
is
liked
by
many
people
you
will
think
why
it
has
become
sour.
So,
the
milk
is
spoiled
may
not
be;
the
many
people
may
like
that
soured
milk.
So,
they
for
them
this
milk
is
typically
made
by
the
fermentation
of
lactic
acid
forming
bacteria
and
they
this
is
called
LAB
lactic
acid
forming
bacteria
LAB
right.
So,
they
for
lactic
acid
and
mix
the
milk
sour
right.
So,
souring
of
milk
is
done
by
typically
lactic
acid,
but
the
fat
content
is
very
high
it
is
18%
right
18%
we
have
said
cream
to
be
around
30
to
36%
that
is
light
weeping
or
heavy
weeping
cream.8
So,
18%
is
many
not
be
equal,
but
it
is
not
so
less.
So,
very
high
fat
content
that
is
why
may
be
to
make
it
palatable
people
would
like
to
have
it
in
a
in
a
form
of
sour;
so
in
souring
form.
So,
they
would
like
to
have.
So,
that
is
why
this
lactic
acid
forming
bacteria
is
added.
So,
that
acid
is
form
and
it
becomes
sour
right.
Then
another
one
is
called
yogurt.
Yogurt
is
very
popular
all
over
the
world
this
is
also
another ,
which
is
a
fermented
product
of
milk
right
milk
fermented
and
this
is
by
fermentation
of
milk
produced
where
it
is
like
custard
I
do
not
know
whether
you
have
you
ever
had
custard
it
is
a
consistency
is
like
the
custard
like
its
consistency
is
like
custard,
but
this
is
also
a
one
fermented
one
where
this
some
organisms
are
added.
So,
that
the
desired
flavor
acidity
is
developed,
and
the
consistency
becomes
equivalent
to
the
custard
like
things
right
that
is
which
we
call
yogurt
any
this
yogurt
is
popular .
In
our
country
it
is
more
popular
in
the
cities,
I
do
not
know
about
the
interior
of
the
villagers,
but
cities
it
is
available,
you
get
many
types
of
yogurt
right.
And
it
is
made
by
fermenting
partially
skim
milk
right
partially
skim
milk
it
is
made
from
that
which
special
acid
forming
bacteria.
So,
that
is
what
that
acid
is
being
formed
by
the
acid
forming
organism
and
they
make
the
acid
and
the
flavor
right.
So,
we
with
this
today
we
complete
or
finish
the
class
because
time
is
no
more.
So,
in
the
next
class
let
us
see
what
we
can
discuss
and
complete.
Thank
you.
