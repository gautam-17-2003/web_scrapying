Heat Transfer by Radiation (Contd.)
So, good morning; we have been doing that radiation heat transfer ‘right’. So, in the
previous classes we have given some idea of radiation heat transfer, how radiation is
taking place, what is the role of these particles or like in convection in conduction we
need to have always some medium, but radiation does not need any medium even in
vacuum also it can radiate.
So, from those initial idea we let us now look into some problem. We also said that
emissivity ‘right’ and the Stefan Boltzmann constant that we have said and we now
utilize those thing into this class. So, this is the plus number lecture number 37 where we
are continuing with heat transfer by radiation ‘right’. This is a continued class ‘right’. So,
that if we know then we can directly go into a problem where this can be solved ‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:52)
There is a mass of gas at 600 K perhaps this one we have done. Yes this solution we are
done do because this is reminding me that this solution we have done where the epsilon
came out to be this ok. If we have already done, so, we are not going to repeat.(Refer Slide Time: 02:17)
So, next we go to this. This is a very important one that is radiation shield ‘right’. From
this figure we see that there are 3 or 2 parallel plates ‘right’ in between there is a
radiation shield and the properties of these parallel plates a properties values which are
given that this plate is at T 1 with an Ɛ1 emissivity and A as the area ‘right’. This plate has
a temperature T2 emissivity Ɛ2, but same area A and the radiation shield which you have
that is giving that T 3 at one end one side facing the plate 1 and the emissivity is Ɛ 3,1, but
having the same area A.
Whereas the other side facing the plate 2 that is having temperature T 3  emissivity a Ɛ3,2
and area A ‘right’. This is a very very important one. So, that if we understand one we
can do whether it is having single radiation shield or multiple radiation shields ‘right’.
Now, we go into that the Q o that is without any radiation shield the value of this would
have been as we have seen earlier is Aσ(T 14 – T24)/(1/ɛ1 + 1/ɛ2 – 1) that is had there been
no radiation shield ‘right’. This is between the 2 parallel plates how much whose who
which having epsilon 1/ ɛ 2 as the emissivities.
So, how much would have been the Q or the rate of heat transfer ‘right’ that simply like
this we can find out ‘right’. So, here we define another parameter called J or radiosity
which means radiation emitted by surface plus radiation reflected by the surface both
emitted as well as reflected this two summation is the radiosity ‘right’.We also define Eb or black body emissive power ‘right’ that is one black body emissive
power and epsilon emissivity and another one is F that is view factor like this is parallel
‘right’. So, had it been inclined like this the view factor would have been different. What
we affected is having now between them that view factor is had it been inclined like this
cannot be the same ‘right’. So, that is why this view factor has come in that a view factor
and we achieve since we are taking parallel plate. So, F 13 that is between this two and F 32
between these two are having view factor equal to 1 for large parallel plates ‘right’.
So, once we have all these then we can apply that electrical analogy or thermal resistance
concept thermal resistance already we have done many times in thermal that conduction
problems ‘right’. So, that same thing if we apply that a Q is flowing where first coming
to this surface. So, this is having a resistance equivalent to E b1 ‘right’ or rather at this
point you have a resistance of J 1 that is both radiation plus reflection together and this is
1 minus that resistance is (1 - ɛ 1)/ɛ1 ‘right’.
Second when it is coming to this surface is 1/A F 13 facing this that is along with the view
factor then the other side ‘right’. So, this is a this is for the view factor and another for
the emissivity there 1 minus that second resistance is (1 - ɛ 31)/Aɛ31 then the this side
emissivity that is (1 - ɛ 32)/Aɛ32 ‘right’ and the view factor that is 1/AF 32 and lastly the
resistance due to the due to this plate that is (1 - ɛ 32)/Aɛ2 ‘right’.
So, all these resistances we have ‘right’ and with this we can find out by change this
without the plate ‘right’ without the radiation shield that was this. So, this we can rewrite
with the shield.(Refer Slide Time: 09:12)
And we can see that now we can write with the help of radiation shield that the heat
transfer rate Q across this system with one shield that can be written as with one shield
that can be written as Q 1 = A σ (T14 - T24) ‘right’.

. This minus came from here ‘right’.
This minus came from here ‘right’. This is like that 1/ɛ 31 that minus this ɛ31/ ɛ31 that is 1
‘right’. So, this ɛ31 this ɛ32 we have taken it is here 1/ɛ 31 or 1/ɛ32. So, one more - 1 we get
it here. So, those 2 minuses are duly taken care of ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 11:07)
So, that is the Q ‘right’ and if emissivity of all surfaces are equal then we can write that
Q1 = A σ (T14 - T24)/[2(2/ɛ-1)]. So, many words ‘right’ and under this if there are n
number of shielding having equal surface emissivity then we can write Q n similar to this
is equal to A σ (T1 - T2) to the power (T14 - T24)/(N+1) this was 2 for a single shield so;
that means, 1 shield plus 1. So, n shield plus 1 is N + 1 ‘right’. 
So, A σ (T14 - T24)/ [(N+1)(2/ɛ - 1)] is the Q n ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:32)
So, if this is known then we can write hence the ratio of heat transfer rates for parallel
plate systems having N shields and no shield having N shields and no shield when all
emissivities are equal then we can write Q n and by Qn/Q  is equal to 1/[N+1] ‘right’.
For two concentric spheres or long cylinders with opaque surfaces having A 1 and A2
surface areas and T 1 and T2 temperatures and ɛ 1 and ɛ2 emissivities of the inner and outer
surfaces respectively and assuming that the view factor F 12 and 2 1 are whatever is all the
factors are equal to 1 then we can write that for A 1 is equal to we can write Q o equal to
A1 σ (T14 - T24)/ [(1/ ɛ1)+(A1 / A2)( (1/ ɛ2)- 1)]   that is for opaque surfaces having surface
areas A1 and A2. So, earlier we had same on the vertical plates we had same area ‘right’ if
you remember.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:15)
Now, here the areas are different one is A 1 and another is A2. So, and obviously, earlier
also we had ɛ1 ɛ2 they were different.(Refer Slide Time: 14:28)
Temperatures were also different it was at T 1 it was at T2. So, those things were ‘right’,
but now we have changed the area and if the area is changed then the for two such
system where two opaque surfaces are there and they are we said the either concentric
spheres or concentric cylinders whatever it be ‘right’ like this. So, this is one and another
is this. So, center is this Tt is not properly actually when you are drying in this you have
to be a little careful. So, like this ‘right’.
So, this area is different this area is different, but they are concentric ok. So, A 1 σ (T14 -
T24)/ [(1/ ɛ1)+(A1 / A2)( (1/ ɛ2)- 1)].(Refer Slide Time: 15:42)
Now, had if it is like that that these two areas are same then it becomes that parallel plate
having same area ‘right’. So, if A 1 = A2 = A then it becomes this is unity 1 and this
becomes A so; that means, it is reducing to that parallel plate. So, this is the limiting
situation and since it is satisfying means this expression is correct ‘right’.
Now, if radiation  shield  is  placed  between the two surfaces  and ɛ 31 and ɛ32 be the
emissivities of the shield add the surfaces facing the inner and outer surfaces of the
assembly respectively ‘right’. Now we say that we had this ‘right’ and this was the
centre. So, we are putting another radiation shield in between where this ɛ 31  and ɛ32 are
the emissivities of the shield ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 17:03)
So, if that be true then we can write like this that the rate of heat transfer across the one
which we I drew there it is neatly drawn ‘right’ of course, with the help of the facilities
having. So, the rate of heat transfer across considering F 13 and F32 is equal to 1 F13 means
that first and this is the second radiation this is the third ‘right’ like this.
 So, we are putting one layer we have put we are putting one like this ‘right’. So, that is
the shield ‘right’. So, this shield is having F 13 and F32 equal to 1 and we can write Q 1 = A1
σ (T14 - T24)/ [(1/ ɛ1)+(A1 / A2)( (1/ ɛ2)- 1)+ (A1 / A2)( 1/ɛ3,1+1/ɛ3,2-1)] ‘right’.
Similar as we have seen without the shield ‘right’ here only we have added that shield.
So,  if  this  is  true  then  our  Q  has  become

.  So,  this  is  similar  to  earlier  one
earlier shield one that whatever parallel shield or parallel plates we had the shield the
similar expression except the area ratios because the areas are different A 1 A2 and A3
because this area this area and the shield area they are all different ‘right’. 
Now, the limiting situation is that if all areas are same that A 1 = A2 = A3 if that be true is
equal to A then we can substitute this as A ‘right’ this becomes 1 this becomes 1 ‘right’
then for A1 = A2 = A3 this equation reduces to the same for the parallel plates ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 20:23)
Then it becomes epsilon it becomes epsilon sorry A σ T 14 - T24 (1/ ɛ1) + (1/ ɛ1) + (1/ ɛ2) (1/
ɛ1) + (1/ ɛ2) - 1 this is number 1 then plus this becomes 1; 1 by this 1/ɛ 3,1 + 1/ɛ3,2 - 1 that is
nothing, but the same equation as we did it for the parallel plates ‘right’. 
We can solve a problem like this 2 large parallel plates at T 1 = 900 K and T2 = 600 K
have emissivities ɛ 1 0.4 and ɛ2 0.8 respectively. A radiation shield having an emissivity
ɛ3,1  is 0.05 on one side and an emissivity of ɛ 3,2 is equal to 0.1 on the other side is placed
between the plates. Calculate the heat transfer rate by radiation per square meter with and
this is  with and without the radiation shield ‘right’.
So that means, you have to find out that heat transfer rate by radiation per square meter
with and without the radiation shield ‘right’. This solution is also not so tricky because
we have already found out what is the expression.(Refer Slide Time: 22:17)
So, if we solve it comes to like this that the heat transfer rate without the shield is
determined as 

 so much watt.
So, by substituting the values we get σ is 6.57× 10-8. This is what you have to remember
throughout  life  that  the  sigma  Stefan  Boltzmann  constant  is  6.57×  10-8  in  many
interviews or many such kind of; such kind of exams things are or that oral exams these
things may be asked ‘right’.
So, (9004 - 6004) ‘right’ over (1/0.4 + 1/0.8 – 1) ‘right’ this is Q o/A this has come 12,578
W ‘right’ 12,578 means 12.578 kW ‘right’. Then we also need to find out this was
without. So, we also need to find out width. So, the heat transfer rate with shield that can
be written as 

 ‘right’.
So, for the surfaces that is this surface and this surface and this is for the shield for both
the faces facing this and facing that ‘right’. So, if that is known then by substituting the
values sigma value 5.67× 10-8 ‘right’ and 9004  T24  - 6004 these are the 2 temperaturesgiven T1 and T2 over ɛ1 is given 1/0.4 ɛ2 is given 1/0.8 1 ‘right’ - 1 and ɛ 3,1 is given 0.05 is
1/0.05 ɛ3,2 given 1/0.1 or point given 0.1. So, it is 1/0.1 - 1 ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 26:19)
So, this on simplification gives the numerator to be 29,852.6 because that is how it such
big numbers can be handled. So, we write first the numerator do not do all at the time it
there may be a mistake ‘right’. So, or if the mistake is not there at the numerator if it is at
the denominator then the entire thing goes out. 
So, that is why first do that numerator. So, it is 29,852.6 and then the denominator that is
31.75 ‘right’. So, here having the same area otherwise if it would have been different
areas like A1 and A2 they are A3 then it would have been a little different than this ‘right’
this is for the same area of all.(Refer Slide Time: 27:23)
So, this has become 29,852.6 by 31.75 is 940.2 watt per meter square. So, without shield
the heat transfer rate was 12.5 kW whereas, this is 940; that means, almost 1 kW ‘right’.
So, 10 to 10 times the heat transfer has been reduced by putting the shield. So, this is
how and why the shield is being put and people do prefer for big things or for valuable
things to protect by from the radiation by putting radiation shields ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:33)
So, do us do similar problems here we have shown that it is almost one tenth or one
twelfth ‘right’ the without shield and with shield it is one tenth or one twelfth of thewithout with shield is one tenth or one twelfth of the with shield ‘right’ sorry without
shield I mean with shield the value is one tenth or one twelfth ‘right’ one tenth to one
twelfth of the with this is with shield without shield ‘right’. 
So, you can reduce the heat transfer rate by 10 times from the with shield by giving a
shield ‘right’ to the from the without shield by giving a shield ok.
Thank you.
