Thermal Resistance
 
So good afternoon, so we are continuing with the Thermal Resistance concept. And as in
the previous class we are said that, till now we have done irrespective of cylindrical or
rectangular or spherical coordinate. The resistance was seen series, all the resistances
where in series, but it is not unnecessarily all the time you will have all the resistances in
terms of series; it may be also in terms of a combination of series and parallel. So, we
will look into those also, ‘right’. So, we come to the class number lecture number 15,
where we shall highlight on thermal resistance, ‘right’. So, on thermal resistance will do
this today that earlier we have already done, the all spherical, cylindrical and rectangular
coordinate, ‘right’. So, if we now take that thermal resistance concept where, if you
remember we had said that equating equation number 1 and equation 3 and equation 4,
things like that again it will come here, ‘right’. So, the Q that quantity of heat is flowing
through any resistance is 
That means, you have been one side T a temperature and in another side T b temperature,
where in between  different temperature  ranges like, T 1, T2, T3, T4 you can have at
different locations, ‘right’. And in this case as we have said earlier that Q is equal to
delta T by resistance. So, here also that delta T each case delta T for the first case it is T a
minus T1 and its resistance is R a. So, Ra can be 1/ha just a minute, so I that is what it is a
composite medium, ‘right’.
So, this  is  a composite  medium  and in that  composite  medium,  we are doing this
resistance concept, ‘right’. So, environment is T a, with a Q heat flow is going on and
fluid is flowing at a temperature T a, ha and another this is temperature is going through a,
another environment is, with the temperature T b and it is flowing Q and heat transfer
coefficient is hb, ‘right’.So, at the surface we have temperature T 1, with conductivity of the material 1 to k 1
having the thickness L 1, coming to point 2, where it is T 2. And the second material is
having conductivity of k 2, and the thickness L 2 third material with the conductivity of k 3
at the temperature of the interface T 3 with transfer with thickness L 3, ‘right’.
If this be true then, we can write that Q quantity of heat is flowing where it is studying
where the temperature T a which are through a resistance R a at temperature T1, coming to
a temperature T1 through that resistance R 1, coming to the temperature T 2 through the
temperature resistance R 2 coming to the temperature T 3 and resistance R3 coming to the
temperature T4. And finally, through are we going out to that temperature T b where to the
Q flowing out, ‘right’.
So, this we have then this picture we have finally, made it like this that Q is equal 
 So, similar thing we have to find out, whether it is a series or parallel, in this case all the
resistances, which we have shown where under resistance under series condition, ‘right’.
So, all the resistance is where under series condition. So, it can be that it will be series or
it may be not in series, so that subsequently let us look into, ‘right’.
For this example, we have taken that on L length, ‘right’, L length, this side is insulated,
this side is insulated and the other perpendicular to this is also insulated. So, only one
dimensional heat transfer is occurring through this, ‘right’. And these 2 sides are at the
temperature T1, these 2 sides are at the temperature T 2 and this is divided into 2 pieces
that is this is one material, having area A 1 and conductivity k 1. This is another material
having A2 area and conductivity k 2. So, in this case it is appearing that the resistances are
not in series.So, Q quantity of heat is coming to the point temperature T 1 and then, a resistance of R is
R1 is equal to L/Ak1. Because the L is the length for both the slabs, ‘right’; both the slabs
the thickness is L through which it is following so it is L and the resistance is R 1 is
L/Ak1, ‘right’. And another resistance R 2 is equal to L/A2k2, A1, k1 was the first former
this and L/A2k2 is this, ‘right’. If this be true, then we can now use the parallel series or
series and parallel this concept.
So, here it is; obviously, appearing this R 1 and this R2 or not that is that Q is coming the
to this point and getting this distributed one through this and another through this. And
then getting conducted coming to this point T 2 this is also late coming to this point T 2
then, this through our again going out as a Q, ‘right’. So, that is what pictorially we are
demonstrated can this how? That Q is coming out this is here then through this resistance
that is L/Ak1 is equal to R1 and through this resistance equal to R 2 is equal to L/A2k2
coming to the point T 2 and going out as Q, ‘right’.
So, we have to solve this problem, ‘right’. So, this problem can be easily solved by the
thermal resistance, only we have to take care of the proper resistances. So, Q is ∆T total/ R,
‘right’ and in this case ∆T is equal to as it is written T a -Tb, ‘right’ and R is the total
resistance equal that is R.
And in this case that R is not in series, but in parallel, so for parallel resistance we know
that 1/R is equal to 1/R 1 plus, 1/R2, ‘right’ and R1, R2 are known. So, R1 was L1/Ak1; and
R2 was L/A2k2, ‘right’.
 So, if we do that, then we can see that this 1/R is equal to (1/R 1)+(1/R2) which on simply
which on substitution gives A 1k1/L plus A2k2/L, ‘right’. So, this on simplification gives
us; this on simplification gives us, perhaps here we are not taken and this we can write
this is equal to L, so A 1 which we are not further proceeded, but this can be written
A1k1+A2k2, ‘right’. So, if A1, k1; A2, k2, L are known, if T a and Tb are known, then Q you
can easily we found out, ‘right’ this is one example.
Another example can be; another example can be like this. So, you have T 1 as insulated, I
not insulate T1 on one side T2 on another side and other 2 sides are insulated, ‘right’; that
means, there is no heat flow from the other two sides. So, in this case we have a slab like
this another small slab like this, third is like this, fourth is like this and fifth one is like
this, ‘right’. So, 5 individual slabs of different length and conductivity are there and of
different type of flow pattern, ‘right’.
So, in one case, it is this T that is Q is coming through this T through this material at this
point and then getting distributed as earlier, ‘right’, getting distributed like this, ‘right’.
Coming to this point and then again they are joining each other for being this T 2 and then
going out as Q, ‘right’. So, this is the concept which we have utilized here.So,  Q  quantity  of  heat  is  coming  to  the  point  T 1,  which  the  resistance  of  R A
corresponding to this T 1, because this T1 can we corresponding to 1 h 1 and another Ta
which will give us R A. Then it has come to that point and that if it is assume that this is a
constant temperature boundary, this is also a constant temperature boundary that this
boundary is giving first resistance of this which is R A, so this is the material A, ‘right’,
So, that gives us R A and this again going through all these 3 one is R B and these RC and
another is RD there are in parallel. Then all these 3 parallel are coming to this point, from
this point and then going to the R E and to the temperature T 2 and then going out as Q,
‘right’..
So, we know A; we know R B, RC, RD, RE, then we can easily find out Q that taking that
RA is in RA is there. So, then we have 3 parallel resistances,  R B, RC, RD, ‘right’, which 3
are then going through R E and then going out as Q, ‘right’, this is as Q. 
So, RA plus, total R will be R A+1 /RB+RC +1 RD+1/RE, ‘right’ which we did in the
previous one also. So, ones R A, RB, RC, RD, RE are known we find out that value of Q,
‘right’, so this is another example of combination.Similarly, we can see that if the composite of two materials combined in parallel paths,
with the ends maintained at uniform temperature as shown earlier, what is the rate of
heat transfer Q across the composite medium? Given A 1 is 0.3 m2, A2= 0.5 m2, k1 =25 W/
mºC, k2=20 W/mºC, L 0.6 meter, T a =130ºC, Tb =30 ºC, ‘right’. So, from this problem it
appears that the insulation will be like this, ‘right’ that insulation will be like this.
Or insulation can be also like this, it is A 1, k1, A2, k2, L is constant. So, this is maintain
that T1 this is maintain that T 2, ‘right’. So, similar this if it is then, we know that 1/R,
equal to A1k1/L + A2k2/L, ‘right’. So, this means A 1 given 0.3, and L is 0.6, k 1 given 25
and L  0.6, A2 given 0.5, k2 given 20, L same 0.6. So, this becomes 29.16 that is 1/R . So, if it is so then Q is equal to delta T, i.e., T a -Tb over R. So, delta T is 130 minus 30
and 1 by R has the value of 29.16; so 1 by R into 29.16 equal to 2916.6 watt, ‘right’. So,
this is another example which we have found out.
Now, it was proceed further and see a different type of solution, a steel tube with 6
centimeter ID, 8 centimeter OD and k W/mºC is covered with an insulating covering of
thickness 2 centimeter and k conductivity point 0.25 W/mºC. A hot gas at T a equal to 350
ºC, ha equal to 500 W/m2ºC flows inside the tube
The outer surface of the insulation is exposed to cooler air at T b is equal to 20ºC with
heat transfer coefficient h b is equal to 50 W/m2ºC. Calculate the heat loss from the tube to
the air for a given H of 12 meter of the tube. Calculate the temperature drops during or
resulting from the thermal resistance of the hot gas flow, the steel tube, the insulation
layer and the outer air, ‘right’, so all the resistances we have to find out, ‘right’.
So, if we read it once more perhaps this will be today is a last problem because the time
which we have by that I hopefully we can complete  this one. A steel tube with 6
centimeter, ID 8 centimeter, OD and k 20 W/mºC is covered with an insulating covering
of  thickness  2  centimeter  and  k  conductivity  0.25  centimeter;  k  conductivity  0.25
W/mºC. A hot gas at T a 350 ºC, ha 500 W/m2ºC flows inside the tube.
Outer surface of the insulation is exposed to cooler air at T b is 20 degree centigrade with
hb equal to 50 W/m2ºC. Calculate the heat loss from the tube to the air for a given H of 12
meter  of  the  tube.  Also  calculate  the  temperature  drops  during  temperature  dropsresulting from, the thermal resistance of the hot gas flow the still tube the insulation layer
and the outside here, ‘right’.

So, this means that if we have different then, we can find out delta T also and that is what
is that we said the thermal resistance concept we will do it today and we will finish and
you have done it. So, you do it at home, practice with different problems of different
combinations. May be in terms  of series  in terms  of single parallel  or in terms  of
combination of series and parallel and then it will be very clear to you, ok.
Thank you, good day.1 2
