Heat Exchangers ( Contd. )
So, we if you remember in some one two classes earlier, we had given a problem to you
and said that you try and solve it; and if you can very good, if you cannot then we will do
some other day where it may take the whole class, because the concept as well the
problem itself was very lengthy, right. Obviously, this type of problem cannot come in
the exam; in the exam means when you are giving either end of this course exam or
normally any college exam also it is very difficult, because if it is taking half an hour for
us in the class, then it may take even 45 minutes to you in the normal exam class.
So, such a big problem may not come, but the advantage of doing it is that why you are
then emphasizing. The advantage of doing it is that, many other associated things we will
come across; and that will be one added learning from our side right. That is why I gave
the problem and I wanted you to first solve; if you could have a were excellent, but if
you could not then let us do it and that day itself I said that this problem, solution of the
problem may need trial and error may be because the time may be over. 
I did not do number of trials, but ultimately what would be the final or close to that I had
given perhaps on this; and said that whatever has been asked for we have done that right.
Perhaps you have been asked to find out the length, so for I remember, let us look into
that right. So, this is the lecture number 53 for the continuation of the heat exchangers,
right.  So,  lecture  number  53  we  are  doing  the  perhaps  the  last  class  for  the  Heat
Exchangers right.(Refer Slide Time: 02:57)
And in that case the problem which was given is like this; that determine the length of
tubes  in  a  two  way  pass  10  ton  refrigeration  TR,  right.  This  TR  is  generally  in
refrigeration used and that is called tonnage of refrigeration, 10 ton refrigeration TR or
10 TR it is in short said, shell and tube water cooled condenser.
Now, this I purposefully gave and I had given one more problem which we had solved, if
you remember correctly; that we had given a wall. And we said the along the wall and if
this is the x direction right and if say this is the 0th and this is the x direction right, for the
thickness L or whatever right; there is a temperature distribution in the x direction and
that temperature was a polynomial, distribution of temperature was a polynomial.
So, a + b x + c x2 + dx things like that, right; so, that polynomial temperature that was
solved and we found out different things in that right; and this is true in normal any cold
store right. And in the cold store if it is the evaporator right, if there is a compressor here;
then there is a condenser here and there is a expansion device here, and then this say
from the expansion device it goes to the evaporator again. So, it is evaporator, this is
compressor, this is condenser, and this is expansion device, right.
 So, this is the cycle and, if we put arrows then they follow like this right. This is a
normal vapor compression refrigeration unit; where this evaporator corresponds to 10
way pass to two pass two way pass 10 ton TR shell and tube water cooled condenser, not
the evaporator right. It is the condenser, this one; condenser is 10 ton refrigerationequivalent and that is water cooled. Now, again these condenser tubes are of several
kilometers in normal cold storages; these are several kilometers length right, and this is a
here it is said for that length of tubes in two way pass, right.
So, this is one another, may be another way like that right. Things like that so many are
there right. And over this they are spread of water that is what water cooled, right. And
that in many cases this water is which is being spread is not a good water for which the
problem is associated, there may be a scale farming which we have already said what is
scale farming that is falling, right. So, falling is happening on the tubes and that is the
damaging part, right. So, what we said two-way pass 10 TR shell and tube water cooled
condenser with 48 tubes arranged in 12 columns and R 22 as refrigerant, right.
So, the refrigerant which was getting through this condenser is R 22, right. So, that is
going through this, because it is after as we said after the compressor the condenser is
there. So, compressor is increasing the temperature and the vapor is being cooled through
the  condenser;  then it  is  just cool  phase change  from the  vapor to the  liquid  it is
happening there, and this condenser is cooled by water. The heat rejection ratio, this is
also a new thing perhaps in the last class we had given you some idea, so that you can
solve the problem; however, we will redo that. The condensing temperature is 40 °C,
right.
The water inlet and outlet temperatures are 23 and 30 °C. In this connection since we are
also saying this, and as I said this may be some additional information to you; not only
doing the problem, but also how the problem is being solved and associated things, that
you can cool down the temperature only to the level of wet bulb. So, you must know
psychometric and dry bulb DB and wet bulb WB temperatures must be known, right. So,
from the dry bulb you can come up to wet bulb not below that, right.
That is the reason why that in many cases you will see, in many cities during summer
that typical what we call that there is a blow of fan over a piece of not cloth, a piece of
some water absorbent  right or there is a trickle them. So, that is not being used in many
cities, where the humidity is very high right; if the humidity is very high, this difference
will not be very high. So, unless this difference is high the effectiveness of that will not
be so good, or effectivity of that will not be so good that is called desert cooler, right. So,
those desert coolers are not used in many cities where the your humidity is very high, okSo, this is 23 to 40 °C that is the temperature outlet of the water by which it is being
cooled. The tube inner and outer diameters are 12 and 14 mm respectively. The average
properties of the refrigerant and water are like this,  that for water viscosity of water is
7.5 ×10-4 k g per meter second. Thermal conductivity of water is 0.7 W/m.K; density of
water is 1000 kg/m3; Cpw of water that is it capacity or specific heat rather in this case
not heat capacity; heat capacity is m c p right there is the heat capacity
But here it is specific heat 4.2 kJ/kg.K or °C whatever you write; 1 / h s right surface heat
transfer coefficient is 0.000176 m/m.K or m. °C / W right; that is 1 / h s, that is surface
heat transfer coefficient is h s, o inverse of that is the resistance ok. So, µ w for R 22, that
µw is the viscosity at 12. So, here also viscosity at 12 for R 22 it is 1.8×10-4 kg/m.s; k
refrigerant is 0.08 W/m.K it was 0.7 for water, 0.08 for the refrigerant; ρ rf that is density
of the refrigerant is 1100 kg/m3, so it is heavier than water.
Then hfg or this is called latent heat or the phase change right; latent heat for phase
change that is for either condensation or evaporation whatever of the refrigeration. Then
refrigerant rather that is 165 kJ/kg. And conductivity of copper, because maybe the tubes
are made of copper, so copper conductivity has to be known. So, that is 390 W/m.K  or
°C, whatever you will write. Then we were also given that Nu = 0.023 Re0.8 Pr0.4 right.
And ho or heat transfer coefficient outside is 0.725 k f3 ρf2 g hfg /N that is number of tubes
row or column, right.
So, N do or do µf or µ, yeah in this case µ f ΔT; not small generally temperature difference
is denoted by ΔT and ΔT maybe time difference right. But time is independent, so
generally that is why whenever it is used, you may not be misled; because here it is used
as a variable right and time is independent. So, that cannot be, so it is point to the power
0.25; of course, I do not say that it cannot be ΔT also, T also maybe in some expression
depending on what you are ultimately finding out, ok.
So, from this the outside heat transfer coefficient is this, inside heat transfer coefficient is
not given and we have to find out determine the length of the tubes right. We have 48
tubes arranged in 12 columns. So, N is 4, 48 tubes in 12 columns like this the tubes are
there; and this column number is for 12. So, each column we have 4 tubes, right. So, N is
then becoming 4, right.
 (Refer Slide Time: 15:35)So, that is what we are doing. And before doing it, as we said that heat rejection ratio
which was told that; what is that? It is the ratio of heat rejected to the heat absorbed
right; whatever heat has been rejected by the condenser to the whatever heat has been
absorbed by the condenser. So, that is the ratio or heat rejection ratio it is called. It is not
tolerance that has to be condenser can be evaporator, because anything that will be
accepting something and then giving up something, right.
So,  the  ratio  of  whatever  absorbed  or  rejected  to  the  absorbed  right.  For  a  fixed
evaporator temperature as the condenser temperature increases the COP decreases and
the heat rejection ratio increases. For a fixed condenser temperature, as the evaporator
temperature decreases the COP decreases and the heat rejection increases, right.
So, we can write R = Q c / Qe. And since Qc from the first law of thermodynamics we can
say, Qc is Qe + Wc; means that work of the compressor right over Q e.
 So, this becomes 1. So, 1 + W c / Qe is nothing, but inverse of COP; or Q e / Wc right. We
call that COP is coefficient of performance is that inverse of W c / Qe or it is Qe / Wc
compressor. So, whatever we get the cooling or refrigeration and how much work the
compressor  has  to  be  has  to  do  for  that,  this  ratio  is  the  COP  or  coefficient  of
performance, right.
So, if we do this then we can write, that heat rejection in the condenser for a 10 ton
refrigerant plant is Q c = 1.3 × 10  ×  211 / 60, right. So, for a 10 ton refrigeration plant,
the heat rejection in the condenser Q c is 1.3 ×10 ×211 / 60 that is 45.7 kW right. Thisheat is rejected to the water, because we said that we had this condenser like that and we
have the sprays, right. So, water sprays were like this right, through the reverse. So,
water sprays were like that, and condenser tubes were like that.
So, this water is absorbing heat from the condenser and condenser is giving away the
heat. So, the temperature of the water goes up by 7 °C. The specific heat of water is
given and hence the mass flow rate of water can be found out. Water passes through 24
tubes in a time with a mass flow rate say wmif.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:59).
Then  we  can  write.  if  wmis  the  mass  flow  rate  of  water  that;  then
45.7kW23)(304.2mΔTCmQ w.
wpwwc ; inlet temperature  was 23 and exit
temperature of water was 30. So, this is 45.7 kW, right
So, from both the Q c s, we can write wm= 45.7 / 4.2 × 7 which we have just said, right.
So, this is equals to 1.55 kg/s. So, water flow rate is 1.55 kg/s; therefore, water per tube
is there are 24 tubes, 1.55 / 24 that is 0.065 kg/s is the flow rate of water in one tube or
every tubes. Reynolds number is Re = 4 wm/ π di w µw. So, that is 4 × 0.065/ 3.14 for π
di is 0.012 m and µw given 7.5× 10-4 = 9200.3.Since Reynolds number is greater than 2300, 9200, hence the flow is turbulent and the
heat, inside heat transfer coefficient h i may be found by the Dittus Boelter equation right;
which we had already said earlier.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:21)
So, from that Dittus Boelter equation h i, If we find out, to do that what we need to know;
first the Prandtl numberP prandtl number is C pw µw / kw = 4.2 × 1000 ×7.5×10-4 / kw is 0.7
given. So, it is 4.5. Nusselt number we need to know is h i di / kw is this is the relation;
Nusselt number is 0.023 into any Re0.8 that is 9200.30.8 and Pr0.4 that is 4.5 we have found
out to the power 0.4. So, this comes to 62.24 Nusselt number Nu, which is h i di / kw
So; that means, hi is equals to 62.24 this right, 6 × 0.7 that is k w / di that is 0.012 and this
comes to 3630.67 W/m2 . K or °C right.(Refer Slide Time: 23:56)
If this hi is known, then the refrigerant condenses outside the tubes right. The refrigerant
condenses outside the tubes 48 tubes are in 12 columns. Hence there are 4 tubes 48 over
12 in each column. So, N is equal to 4; 48 tubes 12 columns, so we have 48 by 12, there
is 4 number of tubes in each column, right.
So, we can write h o outside heat transfer coefficient as 0.725 times k refrigerant to the power
3 ρrefrigerant2 g hfg /N Do µrf ΔT1/4 right. So, if we substitute the values and this is that we had
corrected in the earlier one it was Δt. So, here we have corrected because ΔT is the
temperature difference.
So, we can rewrite it as 0.725 values of the property values, k rf  0.08, 0.725 right; 0.083
and ρ is 11002, g is 9.81, hfg is 165 kJ/kg.s 165×1000, right joules divided by N is 3, D o is
0.014, then µrf refrigerant is 1.8× 10-4 and ΔT which is not known yet.
So, by solving this we get 0.725; this whole part of course, here we have one cube and
here we have one square, which you have not written, but you have taken care hopefully.
And that is 0.725 times this numerator becomes 1.4×  10-3 / ΔT0.25, right.
So, we can write where ΔT is nothing, but T r - Tproduct outside o right T po; and ho that is
heat transfer coefficient outside is 0.725 into this on simplification can be written as
1938.85 and ΔT0.25, or these on simplification gives 1405.66 / ΔT0.25  right. Since we do
not know ΔT, so it may be required that we do that delta by trial, right.(Refer Slide Time: 27:48)
From the basic heat transfer equations we can write that what Q c = Ai hi (Tpi - Ts) = Ai hs
(Ts - Tw); where and Qc that can be written as 2 π L k copper (Tpo - Tpi) right divided by ln
(Do /Di) ; or Qc =Ao ho (Tr - Tpa) right. Again overall heat transfer coefficient that can be
written as; Qc =Uo Ao or Uo Ao (Tr - Tw). 
And therefore, we can write to 1/ U o = 1/ ho + do / de (1 /hs) + do / 2π kcopper (ln (do / di)) +
do / di (1 /hi). Or 1/ ho = 1/ ho  + the substitution of the values which comes equals to
0.000535 that is 1/ U o = 1/ ho plus this. Since we do not know ΔT, we are not able to find
out what is the ho.
So, for that let us first assume, first trial that ΔT = 5 °C that is (T refrigeration - Tpo), right. So,
we can write that h o is, condensation heat transfer coefficient h o is 1405 / 0.66 which we
found out to the power divided by 50.25 is 940.03 WW/m2. °C, right.
 (Refer Slide Time: 30:23)Therefore, the overall heat transfer coefficient that we can find out, as 1 / U o = 1 / ho +
0.000535 which we got expression earlier is equals to 1 / h o now we will found out
940.03 + 0.000535. So, this is 0.0016, right. So, inverse of U that is U o = 625 W/m2.°C.
And LMTD can be found out as (40 - 23 – 40) /30, because our outside temperature was
constant; that is the temperature at least the condenser is getting the refrigerant fluid is at
40 degree Centigrade which is having only a phase change. 
So, there will not be any change of temperature of the refrigerant, that will be at 40° ; but
the temperature of the inlet of the water and outlet of the water varying. So, (40 - 23 - 40
- 23 30 / ln (40 – 23/ 40 – 30) that comes to 13.19; so, we know you, we know LMTD.
So, Qc = Uo Ao LMTD; or from there we find out A o is Qc / LMTD × Uo = 45700 /625 ×
13.19 = 5.54 m2, right, we assumed it.
So, assumed ΔT has to be cross checked. How, ΔT is Q c / ho Ao. So, that is 45700
/940.03 ×5.54. So, that becomes 8.77. So, this is higher than what we assumed 5°. So, we
do a second trial and in that second trial same way we find out LMTD, we find out h o, we
find out Uo everything; and by doing that we have seen that the second trail, if it is ΔT is
7 °C instead of 5 and is correct assumption and there are 48 tubes of D o, right 0.014 m.
Hence Ao new or corrected A o becomes 48 π do L right; where L is A o / 48 π do. Ao we
have found out here 5.54 in the second trial, A o can be somewhere 5.1 or close to that,
right. So, Ao is 5.1 48 π and do is 0.014 which becomes 2.42.So, the length of the heat exchanger or length of that, yeah heat exchanger is 2.42 m per
tube, right. Length of the per tube that was our perhaps the problem which we had been
asked to do that what is the, yeah determine the length of the tubes. So, length of the
tubes is 2.52 m, right. So, with this we have solved the problem and you do the second
trial, and hopefully you will get the same result. So, with this let us stop, the time is up.
Thank you.
