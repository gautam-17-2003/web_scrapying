Heat Transfer by Convection (Contd.)
Good  morning.  You  remember  that  in  few  classes  before  when  we  were  doing
convective heat transfer and we had been given, we have been given here that lot of non-
dimensional parameters. So, those non-dimensional parameters on that basis I had given
you a problem. And, I told that you try and may be after some time we will come back to
that and solve so that you can also make it whether things are all, ‘‘right’’ or not
according to your solution, ‘‘right’’.
So, today also we will do that and again and again I repeat that once you are going
through the class then obviously, the class material you have to go through thoroughly
along with that try to solve as my problems other than those which are solved in the
classes. If you can do that yourself then you can come to know that yes you have
understood and you are able to solve unknown problems, ‘‘right’’. 
So, these unknown unseen problems because we had given you lot many relations and it
is not possible in classes to solve these problems differently. Otherwise that would itself,
will become a tutorial of the whole semester or of the whole course which perhaps will
not be permitted by the authority.
So, and I fully agree with you that if such kind of courses are also plotted that becomes
very helpful for you, but unfortunately it is not feasible. What we need to do is that we
will definitely do this and in now in this class in the heat transfer by convection may
continued class number or lecture number 36 will come back to that problem and solve,
‘‘right’’, but again we are managing the time because solution I have been doing it in
advance and not using the calculator over it. 
So, that that calculation will take itself a whole class, but yes at times it may be required,
but I am not sure where from I will get this calculator here. So, that is why I am not
utilizing, ‘‘right’’.(Refer Slide Time: 03:50)
So, let us go into that solution. We go to lecture number 36 and the problem is like this a
hot fluid with a mass flow rate of it was given to you. A hot fluid with a mass flow rate a
2,000 kg/h passes through. Let me yeah it is going off passes through a pipe having
diameter of 25 mm and thickness of 2.5 mm, ‘‘right’’.
So, hot fluid of mass flow rate of 2,000 kg/h passes through a pipe having diameter of 25
mm  and  thickness  of  2.5  mm.  What  will  be  the  film  heat  transfer  co-efficient,  if
properties of the fluids are as follows given. Conductivity is 0.5 W/m.°C viscosity  
1×10-3  Ns/m2, density ρ 1000 per kg 1,000 kg/m3. If average temperature of the fluid is
30 °C and the quantity of heat flow is 300 W/m, 300 Watt per unit length or per meter
what is the average temperature of the pipe wall? ‘‘right’’.
This is number1. Number 2 what will be the film heat transfer co-efficient if the flow
rate decreases to 1,000 kg/h keeping all other conditions same. Third one what will be
the film heat transfer co-efficient if the diameter of the tube is reduced to 12.5 mm
keeping all other conditions same as that of the problem 1, ‘‘right’’. So, let us quickly
look into a again a hot fluid with a mass flow rate of 2,000 kg/h passes through a pipe
having diameter of 25 mm and thickness of 2.5 mm. 
What will be the film heat transfer co-efficient, if property values of the fluid are given
as thermal conductivity is 0.5 W/m.°C, viscosity µ 1×10-3 Ns/m2, ρ density 1,000 kg/m3.
If average temperature of the fluid is 30 °C and the quantity of heat flow is 300 W/m.What is the average temperature of the pipe wall and second what will be the film heat
transfer co-efficient if the flow rate decreases to 1,000 kg/h. It was 2,000 kg/h and now it
is brought to brought down to 1,000 kg/h, ‘‘right’’. Keeping all other conditions same
only the flow rate is changed.
Another one; what will be the film heat transfer co-efficient if the diameter of the tube is
reduced to 12.5 mm keeping all other conditions same as that of the problem one,
‘‘right’’. So, if we look at the first problem we had this pipe whose diameter D is given
as 25 mm, ‘‘right’’, 25 mm and the thickness of this tube is 2.5 mm, ‘‘right’’ and a flow
rate which is flowing is 2,000 kg/h, ‘‘right’’ and all other fluid properties are given. 
This is problem number 1. For problem number 2 again it is same that same d same
thickness, but the flow rate is instead of 2,000 it has been brought down to 1,000 kg/h,
‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:30)
And in the third case it is said that instead of all other things now you reduce the pipe
diameter, ‘‘right’’ and this new diameter is 12.5 mm, ‘‘right’’. So, what is the heat
transfer  co-efficient?  So, you see in 3 different  situations  you are  finding  out heat
transfer co-efficient and as you said in the earlier class that heat transfer co-efficient is
function of many parameters many ways the heat transfer co-efficient will vary and that
is why there is no general equation as for all the things, ‘‘right’’ because it is dependent
on many parameters which we have already said, ‘‘right’’.Now, to solve it as we know that we have to find out the different property values, we
have  to  find  out  different  non-dimensional  parameters  and  these  non-dimensional
parameters; obviously, will be Reynolds number, Prandtl number, Nusselt number these
numbers  and  by  this  time  we  have  more  or  less  memorized  the  non-dimensional
numbers, ‘‘right’’. 
So, if you have any doubt about the non-dimensional numbers. So, before solving it
again have a brushing of these non-dimensional parameters which we had given and then
come to the solution, then it will be easy for you to understand, ‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:28)
So, let us look into that. First thing is that we have been given mass flow rate 2,000 kg/h,
‘‘right’’  and  in  SI  units  mass  flow  rate  is  kg/s,  ‘‘right’’.  So,  kg  per  hour  to  be
transformed into kg per second, ‘‘right’’ so, that we have done 2,000 kg/h, ‘‘right’’. So,
2,000/3,600 is 0.56 kg/s. So, mass flow rate we have got in kg/s.(Refer Slide Time: 12:16)
Next the diameter of the pipe was given 25 mm, ‘‘right’’ and mm is not the SI unit
directly because all other units are in meter. So, that has to be converted into meter. So, it
is 0.02 pipe meter 25 mm /1,000, ‘‘right’’ 25/1,000 it is nothing, but 0.025 mm, ‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 12:52)
So, we got the diameter then we need to know the heat transfer area, ‘‘right’’. So, area of
heat transfer is this is for pipe. It is π/4 D2, ‘‘right’’ D is given D is already 0.025. So, π/4
D2 if we put the value of D as 0.0252 and multiply that with π/4 it comes to 3 not point 3not 49 or 0.00049 m2, ‘‘right’’. So, area also we got. Next comes flow rate has been
given, ‘‘right’’ and area we have found out density we know.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:48)
So, what is the velocity because this pipe when you have a flow rate of Q, ‘‘right’’ or Q
rather this is the flow rate when you have a flow rate of Qthrough a diameter D and the
density of the material is known, then velocity through this you can find out by knowing
the flow rate area and density, ‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 14:21)
So, this is possible as ρAv
m. mis the mass flow rate, ‘‘right’’. mis in the mass flow
rate. So, you see it is mass flow rate. So, it is kg per second, density over density.
Density is kg/m3 and area is m2, ‘‘right’’. So, this m2and m3 goes out 1 m remains and
this kg, this kg goes out. So, the unit remains is meter per second that is the unit of the
velocity, ‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:09)
So, we can find out the velocity as m/ρA that is 0.5 either 55 or 56 rounded off ok. So,
55 is written here by 1,000 into 0.0049 and this comes to 1.12 perhaps it will be 1.122
like that. So, that is why if it is not rounded that 0.56 taken may be it is 1.122 like that it
will come. However, so it does not matter whether it is 1.12 or 1.122 our objective is the
method or procedure by which we are able to find out, ‘‘right’’.(Refer Slide Time: 16:02)
So, we have obtained that velocity through the pipe. Next comes what is the Reynolds
number Re. So, Re we know is Dvρ/µ all the values are given D given v we have found
out ρ given µ also given. So, substituting them into this equation Dvρ/µ by substituting
the value of ρ 1000, D as 1.12 and 1 point sorry v as 1.12 D as 0.025 and D sorry D as 1
yeah 125 over 1 µ1 × 10-3, ‘‘right’’.
So, this leads to 28,000. So, (Refer time: 17:06) is highly turbulent. Whether turbulent or
not that is not our look out at this moment, but we have to find out the value and the
value is 28,000, ‘‘right’’.(Refer Slide Time: 17:29)
So, if that be true then we find out next the Prandtl number. Prandtl number we know is
Cpµ/k, ‘‘right’’; so, the value of C p given value of mu given value of k given. So, Prandtl
number once the fluid is fixed then the Prandtl number will remain unchanged, ‘‘right’’
if the property values does not change then only, ‘‘right’’.
So, we are finding out Prandtl number as C pµ/k Cp given is 4.18 ‘‘right’’; µ a 4.18
perhaps kilojoules. So, into 1,000, ‘‘right’’ into 10-3 that is µ 1 ×10-3 1 I have not written
over k k given is 0.05, ‘‘right’’. This comes to 8.36, ‘‘right’’. This comes to 8.36. For a
check let us look that really this is 4.18 kJ, ‘‘right’’.(Refer Slide Time: 18:41)
That is Cp specific heat which was given temperature fluid 30 °C, heat flow is 300. What
is the fluid temperature, ‘‘right’’ yeah 4.18. Perhaps this was not given here. So, that is
why suddenly it struck me that I did not read out the value of C p while telling the
problem. So, the value of C p is 4.18 kJ/kg.°C.
So, Cp value is equal to 4.18 kJ/kg.°C, ‘‘right’’ for that fluid, ‘‘right’’. So, that this value
was not given. So, incorporate into it. So, while doing the problem perhaps we have seen
that it was not given and perhaps we have taken it, ‘‘right’’. So, here that is what we
have taken it 4.18 into 1,000.(Refer Slide Time: 20:00)
So, that is in J/kg.°C µ is 1× 10-3 and k 0.5. So, this comes to 8.36. I repeat that the value
of Cp we have assumed is 4.18 kJ/kg.K, ‘‘right’’ or per /kg.°C, ‘‘right’’. So, once we
know C through a Prandtl number, once we know Reynolds number then we can use the
earlier relations given, ‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:48)
So, one of the relation was Nusselt number is equal to 0.023 Re0.8 × Pr0.3, ‘‘right’’. So,
this Nusselt number is 0.023 × Pr0.3 or it was Pr1/3 that is that is equal to 0.33, but we have
taken the parse decimal here, ‘‘right’’.(Refer Slide Time: 21:27)
So, if that be true then from this value already Reynolds number is known Prandtl
number is known. So, we can write Nu= hD/K hD/K is Nusselt number, ‘‘right’’ which
we had said earlier also that Nusselt number is hl/k where l was the characteristic length,
‘‘right’’. So, in this case we can write that the value of this is this D is of course, in terms
of your 0.025 ‘‘right’’ and this value has come to h is not known, ‘‘right’’. So, from the
given relation that 0.023 Re0.8 × Pr0.3. 
So, if you put this and the value of Reynolds number is 28,000 value of Prandtl number
is 8.36 to the power of this. So, this value comes to 157.04, ‘‘right’’. So, this value
comes to 157.04 which is nothing, but equal to Reynolds number and that reynold
number is we know hD/K, ‘‘right’’. So, from this we can say that Nusselt number being
hD/k h is (k ×Nu)/D or is (0.5 × 157.04)/ 0.025, ‘‘right’’. So, that comes to 3140.8 W/
m2.°C ‘‘right’’.
So, here we have seen that the value of heat transfer co-efficient has come very high as
to the tune of 3140.8 W/m2.°C.(Refer Slide Time: 24:04)
Where if you just keep in mind the situation we had that π whose diameter was given
0.025, ‘‘right’’ and whose another thing was given flow rate was given as a 2,000 kg/h.
And, it was given that diameter was there and other property values were given that is C p
that is we have introduced C p then µ then k then ρ this values were given.
So, from those given values we found out Reynolds number Prandtl number use the
relation  Nu=0.023 Re0.8 × Pr0.3. So, this is  not having any correction that  viscosity
correction if you remember there was another equation, but this is a simpler equation. So,
that would have been µ/µ w. So, you need to know µ w also µ is given here 1 ×10-3, but not
given at the wall also.
So, there we have found out what is the value of h ‘‘right’’ 3140.8, ‘‘right’’. So, the
other equation other second one which we have to find out that average temperature was
30 °C q/ L given was 300 W/m q then becomes equal to h A (T average - Tpipe) = h × 2 π r2 ×
(Taverage  - Tpipe), ‘‘right’’.(Refer Slide Time: 26:19)
From where we can write q over r into 2 π r h T average Tpipe ‘‘right’’ or (Tpipe – T) Tpipe =
Taverage – [(q/r)/(2πrh)], ‘‘right’’ and this comes to equal to T pipe = 30 - [300/(π)] there is
3.14 × D because 2 r so, D. So, 0.025 into this h 3140.8 and that came to be 28.78 °C.
So, the pipe temperature  average  temperature  of the fluid was 30 degree. So, pipe
temperature came to 28.78 °C, ‘‘right’’.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:05)
And, the pipe had a thickness of 2.5 mm, ‘‘right’’ this you keep in mind.(Refer Slide Time: 27:23)
So, for the last solution for the last problem if we look at this was again we will find out
first the Reynolds number. Now, what has been done now the diameter has been reduced,
‘‘right’’ diameter has been reduced to from 25 mm to 12.5 mm, ‘‘right’’ keeping all
other things at identical.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:58)
In the previous one what we did. It was if you remember it was given that yeah this is
second this was given this was T average Tpipe we have found out that was to be found out. In
this that m dot is 1,000 kg/h, ‘‘right’’ 1,000 kg/h is 0.277 kg/s. So, we found out theaverage velocity which is 0.56, ‘‘right’’ from this relation then from Nu = Re0.8 × Pr0.3 we
found out that Nusselt number to be 90.21 then from the relation of Nusselt number is
hD/K we found out the value of h which came to be 1804.2 W/m2.°C and that is the h
which you were asked to find out.
For number 3 problem we had been given diameter 12.5. So, area we got by π/4 d2,
‘‘right’’. So, it was 0.0012 m2 velocity we found out is 4.66 and then we found out the
heat transfer co-efficient from this, ‘‘right’’. So, Reynolds number was ρDv/µ which was
58,250 from this relation and Nusselt number is 0.023× Re0.8 × Pr0.3. 
So, these times this makes 282.24 as Nusselt number. So, if Nusselt number is 282.24
from the relation Nusselt number is D / k h is found out to be 11,567.2 W/m2, ‘‘right’’.
So, this way you try to solve problems and then get into the subject more and more, ok.
So, next we will go back to what we were doing that radiation heat transfer, ok.
Thank you.
