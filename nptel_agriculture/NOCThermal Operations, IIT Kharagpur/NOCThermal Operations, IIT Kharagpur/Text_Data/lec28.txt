Heat Transfer by Convection (Contd.)
Good afternoon, my dear students. So, we were discussing about the Convective Heat
Transfer, ‘right’. So, when we are discussing about convective heat transfer we have
seen in convection there are two types: one is that where it is by nature or by the
buoyancy force and there it is due to the density difference of the medium of the fluid
rather and fluid we have said that it is either liquid or gas, ‘right’. 
So, that density difference causes the natural convection or it can be by the application of
some forced air or forcing that medium to move and that is called forced convection by
explicitly by application of fan, ‘right’ and we were to the point where the convective
heat transfer is meaningful and that we have to determine, ‘right’.
So, now we are in the lecture number 28 that is Heat Transfer by Convection and this is
continued, ‘right’. These we have already done.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:57)
So, now we are coming to this point that a way to determine the heat transfer coefficient
h, ‘right’, a way to determine the heat transfer coefficient h is by applying the lumpedcapacity formula, ‘right’. If the Biot number that is hl /k is less than 0.1, ‘right’ which we
have already shown earlier also that if the Biot number; this is Bi or in cases it may be
also written as NBi like many that dimensionless numbers are written as n of that number,
‘right’ Reynolds number you have come across by this time that is N RE, ‘right’ similarly
in Biot or NBi can be many numbers will come across afterwards, ‘right’.
So, this is applicable when Biot number is less than 0.1 and the conductivity k of the
material is or of the object is very high, ‘right’ and this L that is characteristic length is
obtained as V/A or volume of the object over the surface area available of the object for
heat  transfer  is  the  and  this  was  this  is  what  we  have  said  earlier  also  as  that
characteristic dimension of the object, ‘right’, and N Bi we have said to be the Biot
number which signifies the ratio of internal conductance or in the internal conduction
resistance to surface convective resistance, ‘right’. 
This  means  that  if  Biot  number  is  greater  than  0.1,  ‘right’,  there  is  large  surface
convective resistance that is large surface heat transfer coefficient. Solution of it can be
more complex method such as Heisler charts and analytical solutions.
So, by applying so, by applying that lumped system analysis that N Bi is equal to hl/k if
we know the Biot number we can find if it is less than 0.1 that solution if you remember
θt is equal to θ0e-mt that solution we can utilize and from there we can find out the heat
transfer coefficient, ‘right’. This is one and another could be from the Heisler chart
which also we have done already, ‘right’. So, heat transfer coefficient h can be found out.(Refer Slide Time: 05:37)
Now,  if  the  object  is  cylindrical  the  dimensionless  parameters  used  to  determine
unknown variables  are  as  follows  that  Fo we have  already  said is  Fourier number
 dimensionless temperatures θ that is 
 , Bi we have already said
inverse of Biot number is there and that that in some cases is written instead of 1/Bi in
some cases it is written as m in some of the books some of the places in place of 1/Bi it is
written as m and which is k/ hl. 
And, in another case which we had said earlier with capital X if you remember, so, that
can be represented as n again that is x/l where x at any distance position and l is the
characteristic length, ‘right’.
So, these things are already said, but there may be though it is the recapitulation it is like
that how at different books and different sources things are also presented. See, in some
case if you find that instead of Biot number this is m and n that time you may feel cold
that this was not told. So, this is like that ok.
So, Fourier number is plotted in the X-axis and theta in the Y-axis, ‘right’; m is used for
determining the slope, and n is used to determine the increment of the slope, ‘right’.
Variables introduced in the dimensionless numbers are alpha that is thermal diffusivityof the object, X is the one dimensional position in the object and this way we can say that
this is close to the plotting Heisler chart which we have done like this that you have in
the X-axis Fourier number there is 
  and in the Y-axis you have theta that is (T t -Te)/
(T0 - Te), ‘right’ and we had a plot of this m and n, ‘right’ these are for Biot number or 1
by Biot number equal to m and these are for different x or the for x by l, ‘right’.
So, depending on whether it was for Fourier number or center temperature or inside
temperature that will dictate how you are plotting, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:20)
So, if you solve a problem like 10 centimetre thick slab initially at 160ºC is data is
immersed  in liquid  at  60ºC  resulting  in  heat  transfer coefficient  of 1200 W/m2  oC.
Determine  the  temperature  at  this  center  line  and  at  this  surface  100  second  after
immersion. Properties for this slab are alpha is equal to point α is equal to 1.0 × 10−5
m2/s; k is 210 W/m oC; Cp is 0.9 kJ/kg oC; ρ is 1600 kg/m3, ‘right’.
I repeat the problem a 10 centimeter thick slab initially at 160ºC is immersed in liquid at
60ºC  resulting  in  heat  transfer  coefficient  of  1200  W/m2  oC  ‘right’  determine  the
temperature at the center line and at the surface 100 second after immersion. Properties
for slab are alpha is equal to 1.0 × 10−5 m2/s; k 210 210 W/m oC; Cp is 0.9 kJ/kg oC ρ is
1600 kg/m3 this is one problem.Second problem you try a long steel cylinder having diameter of 10 centimeter and
initially at 30ºC is placed into an oven at 200ºC having local heat transfer coefficient of
150  W/m2  oC  ‘right’.  So,  it  is  150  W/m2  oC.  Calculate  the  time  required  for  the
temperature to reach 100ºC. Also calculate the corresponding temperature at radius 5
centimeter. Given α = 5.0 × 10−6 m2/s; k 30 W/m oC, ‘right’.
You repeat that a long steel cylinder having diameter of 10 centimeter and initially at
30ºC is placed into an oven at 200ºC having a local heat transfer coefficient of 150 W/m2
oC. Calculate the time required for the temperature to reach 100ºC. 
Also  calculate  the  corresponding  temperature  at  radius  5  centimeter.  Given,  alpha
thermal diffusivity thermal diffusivity to be α = 5.0 × 10−6 m2/s and thermal conductivity
equal to 30 W/m oC, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 13:37)
So, these are the two problems and let us and I say that you try a third problem is also
given that a metallic sphere of 10 mm is initially at uniform temperature a metallic
sphere; that means, we are giving that three types of problems one is slab, another is
cylinder and the third is sphere, ‘right’.
So, a metallic sphere of radius 10mmis initially at uniform temperature of 200ºC. It is
then quenched in water bath at 10ºC having h of 5000 W/m2 oC until the center of sphere
cools to 30ºC. Calculate the time required for cooling this sphere properties of sphere are given α = 7.00
× 10−6 m2/s; k conductivity with 30 W/m oC; specific heat Cp = 800 kJ/kg oC and density
of this sphere material is ρ = 1500 kg/m3, ‘right’.
You repeat, a metallic sphere of radius 10 mm is initially at uniform temperature 200ºC.
It is then quenched to quenched means suddenly it is it is cooled, ‘right’, quenched in
water bath at 10 ºC having h or heat transfer coefficient of 5000 W/m2 oC until the center
temperature of the sphere equal to 30 ºC. 
Calculate the time required for cooling this sphere properties of the sphere are α = 7.00 ×
10−6 m2/s; k conductivity to 30 W/m oC; Cp specific heat to be 800 kJ/kg oC and density is
1500 kg/m3, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:35)
So, this three problem I hope we can solve it here like this: that Slab thickness = 0.1 m ;
Initial  temperature  ‘T i’  =  160  0C;  Liquid  temperature  ‘T ∞’  =  600C;  Heat  transfer
coefficient ‘h’ = 1200 W/m2 0C;  Time of immersion ‘t’ = 100 s; Thermal diffusivity ‘ α’
= 1.46 x 10-04 m2/s; Thermal conductivity ‘k’ = 210 W/m 0C; Specific heat ‘Cp’ = 0.9 kJ/
kg 0C; Density ‘ρ’ = 1600 kg/m3
So, what we have to do? We have to find out the centre temperature T 0 and the surface
temperature TL, ‘right’. These two we have to find out, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 17:56)
To do that let us solve it that first we find out the Biot number, ‘right’. Biot number is,
hl/k from the given properties and given values we see that hl/k is 0.286. Why? Let us go
back that how the properties were given that slab thickness is 0.1 meter, ‘right’ sorry slab
thickness is 0.1 meter, ‘right’ h has been given 1200. So, hl /1200 this is 0.1. So, that
means, 0.1 by 2 is the characteristic length.
So, 1200 into 1/2 is the hl and k conductivity here was is given 210 W/m 0C. So, 2×210.
If you solve it will come to that point to something like that, ‘right’. So, 210 one 0 goes
out. So, it is 120 by 42 hl/k, ‘right’. Oh this l is half 0.01 slab thickness of 0.1 this is
centimetre, not meter, ‘right’ that C has gone out; so, 0.1 centimeter. So, that is this into
10 to the power minus 2, ‘right’.
So, that is how it will come that 120×10-2; that means, it will become 1.2 and this 2 into
21 is 42. So, 1.2 by 42, this will come to somewhere the value which we have said,
‘right’. So, that means, it is coming somewhere closer to 0.2, ‘right’ or 0.3 rather.
So, that if we see that how much we have obtained we have obtained 0.286, ‘right’ that
this implies that when it is 0.286 that is the Biot number being high. So, lumped system
analysis cannot be done, ‘right’. So, that the lumped system analysis is not valid and 1/Bi
= 3.5 inverse of 0.286 is 3.5.And, finding the Fourier number from the Heisler chart we if we find out the Fourier
number then from Bi is equal to 0.286 and 1/Bi is 3.5. If we see that and Fourier number
if that is  
alpha is given, t is also given, l is also known. So, we know the Fourier
number and Fourier number comes to equal to 5.84, ‘right’ and the value of theta is from
the plot of Fourier number versus theta for 1 by Bi equal to 3.5 then from that graph we
can find out that what is the value of theta and this value of theta came to be 0.27, ‘right’
this came up to be 0.27, ‘right’. Here we have shown Fourier number is  
 that is
. So, only the thing which is asking me that here we have
taken 0.1 by 2 that is it is 0.1 meter, but here what we have done we said that was to be
0.1 centimeter, but it is not true it is 0.1.
So, Bi which we have done to be equal to hl/k; h was 1200, ‘right’, l is 0.1 if it is and k is
210 ‘right’. So, h is 1200.1. So, 120/210. Yes, it is 0.1 centimeter yes it is 0.1 centimeter
and if it is 0.1 centimeter then only it is coming this. So, what we said earlier it was 0.1
meter, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 24:25)
So, that is what that hl/k was 1200 into 0.1/2 into 210, ‘right’. So, that 0.1 became this in
went to up. So, to a 120/210×2. So, 420. So, 120 by 420 or this point goes out, so, 12 by
42 somewhere it is 0.286, ‘right’. So, 0.1 meter true. So, Fourier number came to be 5.84
and if Fourier number is 5.24 if 1 by Bi is 3.5 then from the Heisler chart we can find out
that the value of theta which is 0.27, ‘right’. If the value of theta is 0.27 then T 0 from
here of course, this is that 0 means that center temperature, ‘right’; T 0 is the center
temperature.
So, center temperature we have to find out that is what we have been asked to do. So,
. So, we found out the center
temperature to be 87.
Now, we are asked that find out the surface temperature, ‘right’. From Heisler chart
again we can do for a plane wall for the given Bi and given X/L is equal to 1. Why X/L
is equal to 1? Because that if it is a cylinder it was for cylinder I hope it was 0.1, ‘right’ if
we h l by k; l was 0.1 if we remember that. So, oh the thickness was 0.1 (Refer Slide Time: 27:37)
Then you can say that for X/L ‘right’ for X/L is equal to 1. When L a X is on the surface,
‘right’ when this is if this is the material if this is the center then when X is the surface
that time we can say that this X is nothing, but equal to L. So, it is XL/L that is equal to
1, ‘right’. That is why we have taken X/L is equal to 1 and from the Heisler chart we can
find out the theta 0 is 0.83 corresponding to X/L is point X/L is equal to 1, ‘right’. This is
from the second chart where we had done it earlier, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:32)
So, we can say that So, this way from Heisler chart we can also find out the temperatures at the center as
well as at the surface, ‘right’. So, today we have come to the end of this class. We have
given you three problems out of which one we have already done here and others two
you try. Maybe next class we will solve those two problems and you will also be able to
check up, ‘right’ and I will also be able to counter check whether we have done it
correctly or not, ‘right’, ok.
Thank you.
