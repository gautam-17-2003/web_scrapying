Lecture - 32
Heat Transfer by Convection (Contd.)
So, you are handling non-dimensional parameters which are useful, maybe mostly for
heat transfer and some also could be for mass transfer, ‘right’. So, we come to that
lecture number-32 with some more relations are under different situations, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:43)
For example, in this case if it is a annular passage in many cases you may need it, ‘right’,
‘right’. Like, you have a double tube heat exchanger, ‘right’. So, in that case, a fluid
which is flowing in through this, it is annular, ‘right’. So, there you need to know how
the heat transfer to be calculated? So, here such situation we are bringing are that is
called Stefen’s correlation based upon the results of Hausen that is where it is D h = Do -
Di, hydraulic diameter is D o-Di.
And Reynolds number is U or v whatever we call, this is U that is the UDh/μ ,‘right’,
UDh/μ. And Nusselt number is  /KhDh ,‘right’. In that case, Nusselt number is afunction of like that a 467.08.0
)/(117.01)/(19.0)/(Nu
LDPeLDPeDDf
hhoi , ‘right’. Where 0.1 <
Pr < 103 and 0 < Di / Do < 1 and Re < 2300 this is valid. 
But  other  relation,  where  this  Nu or  the  way  it  is  symbolized
8.0)/(2.166.3Nu oiDD for  outer  wall  of  annulus  is  insulated.  If  inner  wall  of
annulus is insulated, then this 5.0)/(2.166.3Nu oiDD , where it was 0.8, ‘right’.
And third case is like this, none of the wall is insulated. So, this is simply one case it was
outer one is insulated, second case it was inner wall is insulated and in third case none of
them  are  insulated,  it  is  simply  annulus  this  as  it  is.  So,


0.2)/D(D0.10243.66Nu
oi ,‘right’,  this  is  if  none  of  the  walls  are  insulated,
‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 05:02)
So, similarly some more correlation if we look at, if it is a f(D i/Do), then there it is as
follows for the three cases. 5.0/14.01/oioi DDDDf i.e., where the outer annulus
was insulated, then outer wall; then case II, where the inner wall was insulated that is this
one was insulated. So, where, 3/1/14.01oiDD. And  IIIrd  case  was  none  of  the  walls  were  insulated,  ‘right’,  then  it  is
1.0/14.01oiDD. So, you see these only the power that is varying, ‘right’, all other
things  are,  ‘right’.  So,  for  turbulent  flow  that  was  for  laminar  flow  Dittus-Boelter
equation is utilized, ‘right’, in most of the cases this is very useful. And valid for fully
developed turbulent flow and properties are evaluated at the bulk temperature; and the
relation is nNuPrRe023.08.0 rather Prn, this is valid for Prandtl number between 0.6
and 100. 
For heating; for heating n is 0.4, for cooling n is 0.3 and Nusselt number is hD i/K,
‘right’, as well that Reynolds number is μvρDi and Prandtl number is KμCP, ‘right’.
So, it is very important, I were like to highlight once more, this side it is fully utilized
that is, ‘right’ not visible. However, this for turbulent flow this Dittus-Boelter equation is
very useful, valid for fully developed turbulent flow. 
As a regarding this fully developed turbulent flow, let me also tell you that what we
mean by fully developed turbulent flow? That when a flow is happening; for example, in
your house you have put the; you have put that tap on, ‘right’, at least maybe in your
lifetime once or twice it might happen that during your maybe you are taking bath and
that time from the shower suddenly there was no water, no flow of water, ‘right’ that
may happen. 
And when the new water came, the waters when it was being coming to your shower; it
was not a continuous, maybe a little and then again a little, then again a little, like that
gradually it is flowing, ‘right’, this situation we called that this is not the fully developed,
‘right’. This situation we call it is not fully developed that when if it is like this there is
no development, but we take that this is fully developed and until the flow is fully
developed or turbulent flow is there, this is not valid. 
So,  it  is  valid  for  fully  developed  flow  and  properties  are  evaluated  at  the  bulk
temperature. And the relation isnNuPrRe023.08.0. Of course, generally for gaseous
Prandtl number or for cooling this 0.3 or if it is heating n is 0.4. And Prandtl number this
is valid between 0.6 to 100 and Nusselt number is related as hD i/K and Reynolds numberis rho Di over  μvρDi and Prandtl number isKμCP. So, this is the Dittus-Boelter
equation. 
Similarly, this we had already said once Sider-Tate equation, the difference between as I
said earlier that Dittus-Boelter equation and Sider-Tate equation is that here you are not
taking care of that viscous effect on the wall, ‘right’, that viscous effect on the wall you
are not considering. So, in Sider-Tate this is also taken care of and the variation of
viscosity with temperature is included and there you are getting Nusselt number is here it
was 0.023, it is 0.036; Re0.8; Prandtl number was with 0.3 for cooling, 0.4 for heating
whereas, here Prandtl number is 0.33 one-third. 
And the viscosity correction is 14.0/w, where w is the viscosity at the wall, ‘right’.
So, this is the difference between the Sider-Tate and Dittus-Boelter equation both is valid
for turbulent flow. 
(Refer Slide Time: 12:35)
But in one case it is valid, rather it is it utilized without the viscosity correction and the
other case it is utilized with the viscosity correction factor, w/. Some other cases are
also  very  important  for  example,  if  heat  transfer  coefficient  from  the  flow  over  a
horizontal plate; if the flow is laminar, so we have a horizontal plate like this so and fluid
is flowing over it, what is the heat transfer coefficient. If the flow is laminar, this relation is given as 3/15.0PrRe332.0xxNu  and valid for
isothermal plate that means, this plate is isothermal at constant temperature, ‘right’, so
this is one.
Another 3/15.0PrRe332.0xxNu  and this is also valid for constant heat flux, ‘right’. So,
heat  flux  earlier  we  have  said  in  many  cases  many  times,  so  I  am  not  repeating.
Turbulent  flow,  if  it  is  then  Nusselt  number  L,   850Re037.0Pr8.03/1  L LkhLNu
 ,‘right’. This is valid when the situation is isothermal for constant temperature. 
Critical Reynolds number has been taken to be 500000. For constant heat flux, Nusselt
number with respect with L, with respect to L is 4 percent more than that of isothermal
condition. Free convection heat transfer coefficient, we are now shifting from the forced
conviction  till  now,  because  turbulent  flow  was  there,  so  that  was  under  forced
convection to free convection that is natural convection by buoyancy. 
So,  if  it  is  isothermal  case,  then  vertical  flat  plate  and  cylinder.  In  that  case,  so
1/4Gr.Pr0.55Nu;  valid  between  104<Re<109.  And  it’s  1/3Gr.Pr0.1valid  for
Reynolds number between 109 to 1013. 
For air, this 1/4t/L42.1Nu and valid before 104 to 109 Reynolds number. And is
equal to 1/3t31.1is also valid for Reynolds number between 109 and 1013, hopefully.(Refer Slide Time: 16:41)
A lot we have given some a little more are there. Like situation is like this if it is
horizontal cylinder, then Nusselt number is 0.53, 1/4Gr.Pr0.53Nu, where Reynolds
number is between 104 to 109. And is 1/3Gr.Pr0.13, again it is valid between 109 to
1012 Reynolds number. 
And if for air,  1/4t/d32.1Nu valid between Reynolds number is between 104 to
109. And 1/3t24.1, this is valid between 109 to 1012 Reynolds number. 
Another case where, upper surface of heated plate or lower surface of cooled plate. So,
you have two plates; in that case this upper surface is heated or the lower surface is
cooled. So, in that case the for plate 1/4Gr.Pr0.54Nu valid for 2 ×104 and 8 ×106
Reynolds number is equal to 1/3Gr.Pr0.15, this is also valid between 8 × 106 to 1011
Reynolds number. 
For air, this 1/4t/L32.1Nu, this is valid for 2 ×104 < I mean, Reynolds number is
between 2 ×104 and 8 ×106. And this is valid for or is equal to 1/3t52.1, where
Reynolds number varies between 8 ×106 and 1011, rather 1011, ‘right’. 
For lower surface of heated plate or upper surface cooled. So, earlier it was this upper
was heated, lower was cooled; now the upper one is cooled and the lower one is heated,
‘right’. So, for air 1/4Gr.Pr0.27Nu, valid between 105  to 1011 Nusselt  Reynoldsnumber and is related as 1/4t/L59.0, where Reynolds number varies between 105 to
1011. 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:06)
Then a little perhaps this is the last that constant for constant heat flux under the vertical
plate, 5/1Pr6.0GrNux, this is true for 105 Grashof number between 105 to 1011. 
Horizontal  cylinder,  under  diameter  Nusselt  number  under  diameter  defined  under
diameter rather 4/1Pr6.0Gr valid between 106 to 1013 Grashof numbers. And Grashof
number is 

kxqgw,‘right’. (Refer Slide Time: 21:17)
So, let us now at least look at some problems which can be solved, ‘right’ with this. For
example, air at the thermal pressure of thermal pressure air at the sorry, air at the normal
pressure passes through a pipe having an internal diameter of 25 mm and is heated from
30 to 90 °C. What is the film heat transfer coefficient h i between air and the pipe wall; if
the average velocity of air is 15 m/s? 
And to solve the problem given properties of air at the this should be f said of given
properties of air at the average temperature of 60 °C are like this density 10.5 kg/m3,
viscosity equal to 0.02 centipoise, conductivity 0.03 W/m.°C and specific heat 1.0 kJ/kg.
°C. 
Here one thing at least we should explain, because for the long term we are saying air
film  heat  transfer  coefficient  why not only heat  transfer coefficient  why, film  heat
transfer coefficient what is that? It is like that we have said here that normal flow or
pressure, blah blah this thing, so we have a pipe, ‘right’. I am not that confident that if I
change the color whether that will be a permanent or not; however, this is good enough
we can see. 
So, this is a pipe, ‘right’ and air is flowing through this, ‘right’. Now, as we said earlier
also that when this air or any fluid is flowing whether it is the air or water or any fluid is
flowing; if this is the pipe, ‘right’; the layer which is close to the pipe, ‘right’, the layerwhich is close to the pipe that will not move, this is called clinging to the surface, ‘right’.
So, it is clinging to the surface it is not moving, because the surface is stationary, ‘right’.
So, the heat transfer coefficient at this and the heat transfer coefficient whether it is
turbulent or natural does not matter; obviously, turbulent will have more value, natural
will have less, but still the film heat transfer coefficient which is on this is much lower
than that at this, ‘right’, because here you have some; here you have some turbulence or
some movement. Here there is no such so, the film heat transfer coefficient has to be
found out, because that is equivalent to giving the resistance, ‘right’, so this we have to
keep in mind. 
Many cases we may have to find out, this type of heat transfer coefficient and we will be
finding out depending on the situation as we have given many relations, some are other
relation may be very much effective or useful and will be utilized, ‘right’.
So, let us solve this problem at least in this class that air at the normal pressure passes
through a pipe having an internal diameter of 25 mm and is heated from 30 to 90 °C.
What is the film heat transfer coefficient h i between the air and the pipe and here also
one h is missing and the pipe here f is missing and the pipe wall if the average velocity of
air is 15 m/s. So, hi between air and the pipe wall, so that is to be determined.
Given, property values of air at the average temperature of so 30 and 90 average is 60, so
at the average temperature of 60 °C as density equal to 10.5 kg/m3, viscosity is equal to
0.02 centipoise, conductivity is equal to 0.03 W/m.°C, specific heat equal to 1.0 kJ/kg.
°C. 
So, if this is given, then first thing which we should do is to find out the Reynolds
number, ‘right’. So, Reynolds number is dv, ‘right’, dvwhatever form we call
it,  ‘right’.  And  Reynolds  number  must  be  over  the  tongue,  ‘right’,  dvis  the
Reynolds number. If you are an engineering student and if you are not able to tell
anywhere that Reynolds number is dv, and then obviously the other side will feel
very bad. 
So, whether it is in heat or mass or any heat transfer of any energy or in any normal class
other, you must know at least Reynolds number as non-dimensional parameter, so that is
dv. So, we find out dvas 10.5 × 15 × 25 × 103, ‘right’, this is what is given; 25our density is given 10.5 and dv is given, we have been given 15 m/s, ‘right’, so v is
15, d is 10.5 and sorry, rho is 10.5, v is 15 and d is 25 × 10-3, 25 mm, ‘right’.
So, 25 × 10-3/  given 0.02 centipoise, one centipoise is 10-3 Pa.s. So, 0.02 into 10 to the
power minus 3, so that means it is 196895; 1 9 6 8 9 5 Reynolds number. So, it is under
high turbulence. 
Similarly, Prandtl number let us find out and that comes to be equal to ( ×10-3×1)/0.03,
where this is Cp /k ,‘right’; Cp given is 10 kJ oh sorry, 1 kJ/kg.K or kJ/kg.°C that is 1,
‘right’ and  is 0.02 centipoise, C p /k , k is 0.03. So, Prandtl number is this is not mu,
this should be 0.02, ‘right’, 0.02 into 10 to the power minus 3 into 1 by 0.03 that comes
0.00067.
So, from the Sider-Tate equation we can find out or Dittus Dittus-Boelter equation we
can find out that4.08.0Pr.Re.023.0Nu , because it is being heated. So, this comes to
be equal to 21.25. So, from the definition of Nu=hd/k where h is can be found, k is
known, Nusselt number is known 21.25 and d is known. 
So, it comes to be 25.504, ‘right’, so much W/m.°C. So, this way try to do application of
these formulae and solved as many problems as you can ok. So, time is up.
Thank you.
