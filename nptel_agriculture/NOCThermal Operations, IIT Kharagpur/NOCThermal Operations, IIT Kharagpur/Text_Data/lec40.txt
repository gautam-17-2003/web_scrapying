Boiling (Contd.)
Good Morning. So, we were discussing about the Boiling mechanism, ‘right’. We had
shown you that now in this 40th class, we will continue with that boiling. Maybe some
problems we will solve that will give us more idea about the boiling mechanism, ‘right’.
We have seen that there were 4 zones; a, b, c and d. So, first one was natural convection,
‘right’ and then that nucleation nucleate boiling, ‘right’ and in the third zone it was film
boiling and fourth was no, fourth was film boiling and third zone that came down,
‘right’. So, with this let us go to that class 40th and let us now look at some problem,
‘right’ and empirical relations. 
(Refer Slide Time: 01:28)
So, some empirical relations are there for estimating the boiling heat transfer coefficient.
So,  for water  boiling  on the  outside  of  the  submerged  surfaces  at  one  atmosphere
pressure  absolute  and  have  been  and  this  have  been  developed  by  some  of  the
researchers, ‘right’. For a horizontal surface that h is 1043 ΔT1/3, when q/A less than that
is flux is < 16, ‘right’. So, again q/A means this is W/m2, ‘right’. In some cases this is
used capital Q, ‘right’ or q/A is small q normally, ‘right’ that is flux ok.(Refer Slide Time: 02:40)
However, here we are using q/A that is Q and this is 16, not q this is q/A that is flux W/
m2 ok. So, that empirical relation is in the horizontal surface. It is 1043 ΔT1/3 when it is <
16 and h is 5.56 ΔT3 where q/A is between 16 and 240. For vertical surfaces h is 537
ΔT1/7 when q/A < 3, whereas, h is 7.95 ΔT3, when q/A is between 3 and 63, ‘right’. 
So, q/A is the in the kW/m2. It can be Watt or kW that does not matter, ‘right’. So, kW/
m2. And ΔT is Tw - Tsaturated, ‘right’, Tw - Tsaturated means you have that if this is the water,
so you have the vapor and liquid there at the same temperature. So, that is the saturation,
‘right’. 
So, there is a equilibrium between the vapor and the liquid, ‘right’ and that temperature
is known as T saturation ok. And this is in Kelvin and h is in W/m2°C, ‘right’. So, this is
these are some of the relations which we will use afterwards. (Refer Slide Time: 04:51)
For pressure correction, if they are we because all were said in terms of 1 atmosphere
pressure. So, if there is relation or requirement for pressure to be corrected, so that
pressure correction is the values of h at wall atmosphere is multiplied by (p/1)0.4. So,
whatever value of h you are obtaining at atmospheric pressure if the pressure ratio that is
p/1 atmosphere that is that value of h which you are giving getting that (p/1)0.4 is taken as
the pressure connection, p is the new pressure and 1 is the atmospheric pressure, ‘right’. 
For forced convection, boiling inside the tubes h is 2.55 ΔT3, ep/1551  W/m2°C that is the
value of h for forced convection boiling, where p is in kilo Pascal kPa, ‘right’. This is not
in atmosphere, this is in kilo Pascal. So, it is e power p/1551 W/m2°C that is the forced
convection, heat transfer coefficient, ‘right’.
In the case of film boiling heat transfer rate is low in view of the large temperature drop
is used which is not utilized effectively, ‘right’. So, one empirical equation for horizontal
tube is like this h is equal to1/4
vpvfgvlv3v
ΔTDμΔT)0.4Cg(hρρρk0.62


 .
So, this is for horizontal tube, ‘right’ the value of h. obviously, all v’s are for vapor and
‘ls  are  for  liquids,  ‘right’.  So,  the  relation  is  like  that  h  is1/4
vpvfgvlv3v
ΔTDμΔT)0.4Cg(hρρρk0.62



 , ‘right’ or that is this can be said to the power
0.25, ‘right’. So, if we look at the values I mean where we said b n l are for vapor and
liquid, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:47)
So, that is what is k v is the thermal conductivity of the vapor in W/m°C, ρ v is the density
of the vapor in kg/m3, ρl is the density of the liquid in kg per meter cube, h f g is the latent
heat of vaporization in J/kg, D is the outside diameter of the tube in meter, a µ v is the
viscosity of the vapor in Pascal seconds, this is in Pascal seconds mind it. 
Mu has different units for different places earlier we had use C p or p that is price or we
have used Newton. So, wherever it is required accordingly you use it. Here it is Pascal’s
second, g is acceleration of gravity in m/s2 and ΔT is Tw - Tsaturated where Tsaturated is the
temperature of the saturated vapor, ‘right’. 
And  the  property  values  all  these  property  values  are  calculated  at  the  average
temperature  of  (T w +  Tsaturated)/  2,  i.e.,  saturation  temperature  and  wall  temperature
average this is the temperature where the property values are evaluated, ‘right’. (Refer Slide Time: 10:30)
So, once we know this type of problem then we can solve once we know this type of
relations that is how to find out the heat transfer coefficient though these are empirical
relations, but very handful and very handy and we can utilize them effectively, ‘right’.
For example, in this problem this is a typical boiling problem that water is being boiled
at 1 atmosphere absolute pressure in a steam jacketed kettle with steam condensing in the
jacket at 120 °C. The inside diameter of the kettle is 0.762 m and the height is 0.9 m. 
This type of kettle is used in food industries for making jam jelly marmalade. In many
small scale industries you will see there were steam jacketed kettle in which the steam is
outside the jacket and outside the kettle in the jacket and inside there is that I mean that
jam or jelly the mixer or the content of that jam jelly, ‘right’. So, normally jam jelly is
made from either say fruit or maybe from artificial sources whatever it be. So, it is water
sugar pectin and acid all these four mixture; however, that is beyond us at this moment,
‘right’. So, 0.762 m and height is 0.9 m.
The bottom is slightly carved, but is assumed to be flat. Both the bottom and the sides up
to height of 0.762 m are jacketed, ‘right’. So, heat is transferred through a 3 mm thick
stainless steel with a heat transfer with thermal conductivity of 20 W/m.°C mounted on
the kettle surface. Inside the jacket the heat transfer coefficient h i, it should be h subscript
i, hi of the condensing steam is 10000 W/m2.°C. Now, what do you need? Predict the
boiling heat transfer coefficient h o for the bottom surface of the kettle, ‘right’. So, we repeat. Water is being boiled at 1 atmosphere absolute pressure. Now, again since
it has come, so absolute pressure and gauge pressure there is a difference, ‘right’. If you
have a gauge by which the pressures are measured, ‘right’. So, fluid is coming here, this
is like what we call to be like watch or similar kind of thing, ‘right’, dial rather. So, that
there is an indicator, ‘right’. 
So, this indicator moves as the pressure goes up and up, ‘right’ and this is at 0. So, when
it is at 0 that is called absolute pressure equivalent to gauge pressure. So, that one
absolute 1 atmosphere absolute is equivalent to 0 gauge pressure, ‘right’, that you mind
it. So, this since it has come we have also explain this.
So, water is being boiled at 1 atmosphere absolute pressure in esteem jacketed kettle with
steam condensing in the jacket at 120 °C. The inside diameter of the kettle is 0.762 m
and the height of the height is 0.9 m. The bottom is slightly curved, slightly curved
means like this there is a reason also for that. Since, it is not part of this and time is also
very valuable, so this curvature is made because that material which is being used they
are food material, ‘right’. 
And if it is not properly cleaned then there may be had it been square like this there
could have been that corner. This corner may contain some food material which if it is
not cleaned after the process is over, if some leftover is there, so there is a chance that
the microbes can invade and may contaminate. So, that is why purposefully from the
engineering point of view this is made a little curvature, ‘right’. Why it is that I have
explained ok. So, both the bottom and the sides up to height 0.762 m are jacketed,
‘right’. 
We will show that in diagram. Heat is transferred through a 3 m thick stainless steel with
a k or thermal conductivity to be 20 W/m°C, ‘right’ mounted on the kettle surface. Inside
the jacket the heat transfer coefficient h i of the condensing steam is 10000 W/m°C.
Predict the boiling heat transfer coefficient h o for the bottom surface; this of course ho
has to be that o has to be suffix or subscript, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 17:28)
Now, if we look at the problem which has been given that looks like this, ‘right’. So, this
is a steam jacketed kettle, ‘right’. This is how it is jacketed, ‘right’ and height is given
and this thickness is given and water at saturation is 100 °C. Steam at 1 atmospheric
pressure is there and we have to find out and this is the T wall. T wall is not this outside;
Twall is this which is in contact with the liquid, ‘right’. So, T wall is that and ΔT is equal to
Twall - Tsaturation, ‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:37)
So, with this let us solve our problem let us solve our problem. And we then come to this
solution like this that inside metal surface temperature is unknown, ‘right’. It has not
been said what is the wall temperature, ‘right’. This is T wall and what is the temperature
there this has not been said. 
So,  inside  metal  surface  temperature  is  unknown.  So,  let  us  assume  that  the  wall
temperature is 105 degrees centigrade. So, ΔT is T w - Tsaturation that is 105 - 100, so 5 °C or
5 Kelvin, ‘right’. As we said that the difference in centigrade and Kelvin is same. So, h o
we can use a ration of 5.56 Δ T3 or 5.56, 53 or is equal to 695 W/m2.°C. So, q/A that is it
flux is h ×ΔT since we know Q is equal to h A ΔT. So, that we can write q/A is equal to
h ×ΔT, ‘right’. So, that becomes equal to 695 is h o we have found and ΔT is 5 is 3475 W/
m2 , ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:19)
So, let us now well we have assumed T w whether the assumption is correct or not you
have  to  justify.  Let  us  now  check  validity  of  our  assumption  by  calculating  the
resistances of the condensing steam, R i of the metal wall T w and of the boiling liquid R o. 
Assuming equal areas of the resistances for 1 m2 because if we go on changing that area
meter square that A 1 then A2 or A3 for different cases then it will be more complicated.
So, we are assuming that area of heat transfer has sin for all and that is 1 m2, ‘right’. We
have to find out the resistances, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 21:14)
So, Ri is 1/hiA, Ri is 1/hiA that is 1/(1000×1), ‘right’, h i has been given 1000; 10000. So,
1/(1000×1); that means, 1 × 1 ×10-4 that is Ri, ‘right’. What are these R i? Ri is if you
remember we had this and then we had this, then we had a jacket inside which that steam
is condensing, ‘right’. So, we have one resistance here with h i, ‘right’ that we have
found out Ri . So, this is the film resistance or the wall.
Then we have to find out R w that is this resistance that is to the wall, this is the wall,
‘right’ through the wall what is the resistance. So, that becomes equal to Δ x / kA,
‘right’. And Δx we have been given 3 mm, so (3/1000) / k is given 20 W/m2°C and area
we have assumed to be 1, ‘right’. So, this has this is coming 1.5×10-4. So, Ri and Rw are
more or less very close, ‘right’. 
Then Ro and then what is that R o? This was our material and now outside that is our
condensing. So, Ro we have found out in this resistance that is film resistance we have
found out this metal resistance. So, this is the R o, that is the steam which is coming and
giving heat here, ‘right’. So, R o is 1/(ho×A). R o has already we have already found out h
o with that relation. So, it is 1/(695×1) that is 1.44 ×10-3, ‘right’. 
So, some of these resistances are ∑R that is some of the resistances is equal to R i + Rw
+Ro, ‘right’. So, this becomes equal to 1×10-4 + 1.5×10-4 + 1.44×10-3, ‘right’. So, that
comes to be 1.69 ×10-3 that is the total R, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 24:34)
Now, if we find out again q, q becomes the temperature drop actress the boiling film is
ΔT is equal to (Ro/ΔR) × ΔT that is (120 – 100) . So, R o is 1.44×10-3, summation of R is
1.69×10-3 and this ΔT is 20, so 17.04. So, the wall temperature becomes 100 +17.04 is
117.04 which is much above the assumed which was 105, ‘right’. So, this is higher than
that assumed value of 105 °C. So, first assumption it did not leak. 
So,  you know  this  is  called  trial  and  error  method.  When  you  are  more  than  one
unknown is there and you have less number of equations, then you do solve with the trial
and error means you assumed one and then find out that with the assume value and if it is
matching very good, if it is not matching you have to reassume, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 26:16)
Now, reassumption will be there, 105, let us assume that 110 °C is the wall temperature,
‘right’. Then delta T is 110 – 100 or 10 °C, ‘right’ and h o why that equation we got 5560,
‘right’, 5560 W/m2 the same equation which we have used 105 °C. And by the same way
you found out Ri, Ro and Rw, ‘right’. So, you can find out all of them. And new R o is now
17.98×10-5 by the same process we have found out, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:17)
If Ro is found out like that as 17.98×10-5 then we can say that ∑R or all the resistances is
2.948×10-5 again. By the same way we have found out earlier R i, the same way now R ihas been found out, the way R o has found out the same way now R o has been found out
and Rw of course, Rw also by the same way, but R w will remain same because you are not
changing the material, ‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 27:58)
If that is not, so ΔR that is ∑R is 2.948×10-4, ‘right’. This is °C/W, ‘right’ resistance. So,
ΔT, then again is R o/ΔR, ∑R, ∑R ×(120 – 100) °C which was given which means we
have already found out this is 2.948, ‘right’. 
Ro has been found out in the previous slide 17.98×10-5, ‘right’. ∑R is 2 point which we
have found out here 2.948×10-5 and this ΔT is 20. So, this comes to 10 for 12.198 °C.(Refer Slide Time: 29:03)
So, the Tw is 100 + 12.198 °C is 112 point, this should be 100 + 12.198. So, this is a
mistake. So, it should be 112.198. So, our assumed value was 110, we got 112.198. So,
next value if you take assumed value as 112.198, I hope you will get very close to 112 or
113 °C that you will be the final answer, ‘right’. So, this way by trial and error you could
find out, by a trial and error you could find out the value of the assumed T w which was
not given, ‘right’.
Hope  we  have  solved  this  and  we  have  come  to  T w as  12.198.  So,  the  boiling
expressions, boiling heat transfer coefficients and the problem solution we have done.
So, we can now the time is up. So, we can close it and then we will next class we will go
for the condensation ok.
Thank you very much.
