Lecture - 52
Heat Exchangers ( Contd. )
So,  good  morning,  we  have  been  doing  epsilon  that  is  effectiveness  of  the  Heat
Exchanger  and  perhaps  we  have  completed  up  to  the  parallel  flow.  What  is  the
expression for effectiveness whether C min or Cmax is hot fluid or cold fluid depending on
that, we had developed the expressions. Now we will do the same for counter flow. So, it
is the lecture number 52 on Heat Exchangers, this is continued.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:26)
And if we look at for parallel flow I support counter flow, counter current flow then we
can write this ɛ = T c; obviously, here missing is that T c1 and this is Tc2, right.
Because we could come to know from here, because we multiplied these thing with this
and this thing we kept intact. So, we get that T c, oh no we took these thing there and
these thing here rather this way, we brought it here and we took it there; so we can come
to know that this was T c1 and this was Tc2, by some mistake we could not make it, right.
So, here it is Tc1  and here it is Tc2. So, (Th1 -Tc2) = 1 / ɛ (Tc1 - Tc2); or this Th1  if you
separate, then we get T c2  plus this, so 1 / ɛ (T c1 - Tc2). So, again on rearranging we canwrite (Th1 -Tc1) = (Tc2 - Tc1); because we have added one T c1 here, we have also added one
Tc1 here.
So, that is why it is going up. So, plus 1 / ɛ whichever was here (T c1 - Tc2). So, this can
further be rearranged as (T h1 -Tc1) right; this is equals to (T c1 - Tc2), if we take  (Tc1 - Tc2)
common, right. So, 1 / ɛ comes first minus 1 because here it is (T c1 - Tc2), one negative
will come right.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:58)
So, if that be true, then we can rewrite that no heat loss why you are saying; that
normally any heat exchanger though there is if this is a heat exchanger; obviously,
depending on the fluids right and this is in this particularly it is counter flow.
So, depending on that whether it is co or counter whatever it be, there will be some heat
loss with the surrounding right. So, that cannot be avoided, but for all practical purposes
if we assume that surrounding heat loss is negligible and that is what we are assuming
that there is no heat loss, then only we can easily do it; otherwise taking account those
heat loss will make it more complicated, right.
So, it can be done, I am not saying it cannot be; but that will make it more complicated
the whole system. So, we can write C max (Th1 - Th2) = Cmin (Tc1 - Tc2), right. And Cmax and
Cmin we had said in the previous day, in the previous class rather; then (T h2 - Th1) is -
Cmin / Cmax (Tc1 - Tc2), because it was (T h1 - Th2).Now we have made T h2 = Th1 minus right; so we have kept this on that side and brought it
to this side, so that is why T h1 minus. Then (Th2 - Tc2) that can be written as (T h1 - Tc2)  -
Cmin / Cmax because we have added here 1 - T c2 we have also added on right side - T c2. So,
Cmin / Cmax times (Tc1 - Tc2).
So, this can be again rewritten (T h2 - Tc2) = 1 /ɛ right; which we have seen earlier 1 /ɛ (T c1
- Tc2), right -Cmin / Cmax as usual into (Tc1 - Tc2).
(Refer Slide Time: 06:48)
So, this on further simplification, we can write that (T h2 - Tc2) = (Th2 - Tc2) = (1 /ɛ - Cmin /
Cmax) (Tc1 - Tc2) right. This is done by subtracting values of (T h2 - Tc2) and (Th1 - Tc1) right.
And from the relation, what we know q = U A ΔT lm; we can write that C min (Tc1 - Tc2) = U
A ΔTlm instead of that we write (T h2 - Tc2) - (Th1 - Tc1) / ln (Th2 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1), right.
So, here all the time mind it that this difference minus this difference should be always
on the numerator, this difference and denominator this difference, right. So, then at least
this part will not be wrong; but in actual when you are having, then you have to take care
that flow direction right and which one is parallel or which one is counter that you have
to take care, ok.
So, we write Cmin (Tc1 - Tc2) is this; then we can rewrite this as C min (Tc1 - Tc2) = UA right
times, instead of this we write (1 /ɛ -  C min/Cmax) (Tc1 - Tc2) – (1/ɛ -  1) (Tc1 - Tc2) /ln (1/ɛ -
Cmin /Cmax) / (1/ɛ - 1). (Refer Slide Time: 09:21)
So, this we can further simplify, writing that ln (1/ɛ - C min / Cmax) / (1/ɛ - 1) = U A / C min
(1 - Cmin / Cmax) right. Or ln of this that (1/ɛ-1) / (1/ɛ - C min / Cmax) this we just inverse is
equals to UA / Cmin that is why we have brought to a negative here, we have inversed it
times 1- Cmin / Cmax right.
So, this means (1/ɛ - 1) / (1/ɛ - C min / Cmax) is equals to, this we can write exp[- UA/ C min
(1 - Cmin / Cmax) right.
(Refer Slide Time: 10:36)
So, this we can further write in this form, that 1/ɛ - 1 = 1/ɛ exp[- UA/C min (1 - Cmin/Cmax)]
- Cmin /Cmax exp[- UA/Cmin (1 - Cmin/Cmax)] right. Or we can rewrite that, 1/ɛ (1 - exp[- UA/
Cmin (1 - Cmin/Cmax)] right this = (1 - C min/Cmax) exp[- UA/Cmin (1 - Cmin/Cmax)] right. Or ɛ
we can write in the form 1 - exp[- UA/C min (1 - Cmin/Cmax)]  / (1 - Cmin/Cmax) exp [- U A /
Cmin (1 - Cmin/Cmax).
 (Refer Slide Time: 12:16)
Now, this we can further rewrite this way, that you we define a term that is called UA/
Cmin; we define a term that is called UA/C min. And this we can term as Number of
Transfer Units or NTU Number of Transfer Units NTU, right. If we define UA/C min as
NTU and explain it from the equation that here, q = C min (Tc1  - Tc2) that we know which
is equals to UA ΔT lm, right.
So, we can write UA/C min = (Tc1  - Tc2) / ΔTlm. So, our NTU which we are calling as UA/
Cmin right, this is nothing but ΔT that is (T c1  - Tc2) right sorry, there is (T c1  - Tc2)  right
over ΔTlm, right. So, if that be true, then we apply it that UA / C min as NTU.(Refer Slide Time: 13:49)
And we can write that UA / C min, UA / Cmin is the ratio of rise or drop of the fluid,
temperature of the fluid with minimum heat capacity and the log mean temperature
difference that is what we had shown in the previous slide also. That, in the previous
slide this was our thing, that UA / C min sorry, UA / Cmin was ΔTc right or (Tc1  - Tc2)  right,
(Tc1  - Tc2) that is why we are saying rise or drop; because we do not know whether that is
(Tc1  - Tc2) is positive or (Tc1  - Tc2) this is negative right. This we do not know. Since we
do not know we are saying that rise or drop ratio of the rise or drop of the temperature
this is the ratio to the log logarithmic temperature, right.
So, because ΔTlm is nothing, but not a temperature but a ratio right; because that was also
ΔT by some ΔT. So, it is dimensionless, right. So, we can say that U A / C min is the ratio
of rise or drop of temperature of the fluid with minimum heat capacity and this is the and
the log mean temperature difference that is the ratio. Now if C H = CC = Cmin, right. So,
that is C hot is equals to or heat capacity of hot fluid is equals to heat capacity of cold
fluid is the minimum heat capacity.
If that be the case, which may be the case in regenerative heat exchangers; regenerative
heat exchanger are those where your extra fluid or extra heat which is not utilized or the
unutilized heat can be regenerated or utilized by sprinkling or preheating, whatever be
the case right. So, that is called regenerative heat exchanger.So, if that is used, the hot fluid may be used to preheat incoming cold fluid or the reverse
we can say the cold fluid can be reused to preheator to or cold fluid can be use to reduce
the temperature of the outcome of the hot fluid; whatever be the case depending on that
your regeneration of the heat will be there and then depending on the flow direction for
parallel flow from the equation already we had, epsilon is equals to 1 minus exponential
minus U A / Cmin (1 + Cmin / Cmax) / (1 + Cmin / Cmax), right
So, in that substituting C min / Cmax = 1, because here we had taken it to be that; then if we
substitute that then we get.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:59)
Then we get ɛ = 1 – exp [-2UA/C min / 2], right. And for counter flow that was for parallel
flow Cmin is, if Cmin = Cmax; then (Th1 - Tc1) = (Th2 - Tc2) = ΔTlm; and (Th1 – Th2) = (Tc1 - Tc2)
and of course, this (T h1 – Th2) = (Tc2 - Tc1) this is this is (Th1 - Tc1) is (Th2 - Tc2) = ΔTlm ok,
and (Th1 – Th2) = (Tc2 - Tc1) = ΔTlm.
So, if that be the case, then UA/ C min = ΔT / ΔTlm = yeah this is (Tc1 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1)
right, this one right. So, this is (T c1 - Tc2), so (Tc1 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1), right. So, we can write
that substituting this value of (T h1 - Tc1) from this (Th1 - Tc1) = (Tc1 - Tc2) / 1/ɛ - 1. We can
rewrite UA/Cmin = (Tc1 - Tc2)/ (Tc1 - Tc2) (1/ ɛ -1); that is equals to 1/ ɛ -1 or 1/ ɛ -1 = 1/U
A /Cmin.
So, this we can then write in this form.(Refer Slide Time: 20:29)
That 1/ ɛ = 1+ 1 / UA / C min = U A /Cmin + 1/UA / Cmin, right. So, ɛ = U A / C min /1 + U A /
Cmin, this we can write in the form of NTU, right.
So, where UA / Cmin is was nothing but, that NTU right. So, this is NTU / 1+ NTU right.
So, that is what we are expressing in terms of number of transfer units and that is related
with the epsilon that is effectiveness right.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:58)
Now if we look at the effectiveness versus NTU, if we look at effectiveness of parallel
flow heat exchanger is always less than that of the counter flow heat exchanger. How,you see for comparison we are writing NTU; if it is NTU, NTU you we said U A / C min
right, that was the NTU.
So, if that is equals to 1 right, then for parallel flow you that effectiveness ɛ = 0.43;
whereas, for counter flow it is 0.5. So, this is less than, right. So, this is less than this.
Similarly if it is for NTU = 3, right; effectiveness for parallel flow is if it is 0.5 then that
for counter flow it is 0.75, again parallel flow is less than counter flow, right.
Similarly, if it is 5 NTU = 5, then it is for parallel flow 0.5; then for counter flow it is
0.83. So, all the time counter flow is higher value for effectiveness than that of the
parallel flow and if NTU = 10 and then for counter flow effectiveness is 0.5 whereas, for
a sorry for parallel flow effectiveness is 0.5; whereas, for counter flow it is 0.9, right.
So, we can say that, this counter flow heat exchanger has always higher effectiveness
than that of the parallel flow, right. So, this means that counter current heat exchangers
are more effective right.
(Refer Slide Time: 24:15)
That we can also see from here, that this table says that effectiveness relations for heat
exchangers is like that NTU is equals to U A s/ C min and C = Cmin / Cmax = m Cpmin /m dot
Cpmax, right.
So, if heat exchanger type is like that double pipe and if the flow is parallel, then the
NTU relationship is like this: ɛ =1 – exp[- NTU ( 1 +c / 1+ 1+ c)]; where c = C min / Cmaxright. Similarly for counter flow, the same ɛ is 1- exp[- NTU ( 1 - c / 1 – exp[-NTU (1-
c)]. For shell and tube one shell pass 2, 4 etcetera tube pass, right shell pass one; that is
the external fluid which is going out is having one pass whereas, the other one has 2
passes or 2, 4, 6 whatever passes, right. So, here we can have baffle and do the passes.
Then there ɛ is 2 (1+ c+ 21c) (1- exp[ - NTU 21c/ 1 – exp[-NTU 21c] right.
For cross flow where single pass both fluids unmixed right; if C max is mixed then oh for
both fluid unmixed ɛ = 1 - exp[ - NTU 0.22 / c] (exp[ - c NTU0.78 – 11]. Or if Cmax is mixed
or Cmin is unmixed; then ɛ =1/ c (1 exp[ - c (1 – exp[- NTU]. Or if C min is mixed and Cmax
is unmixed just the reverse, then ɛ =1 – exp[- 1/c (1- exp[-c NTU].
If all four heat exchangers with c is equals to or if all heat exchangers with c = 0; then c
= 0 means Cmin is 0, right. So, epsilon is 1 – exp(NTU), 1 – exp[ - NTU] right.
(Refer Slide Time: 27:41)
So, we can write, that NTU relations for different double tubes, different heat exchangers
type are also like this right. When all the inlet and outlet temperatures are specified, the
size  of  the  heat  exchanger  can  easily  be  determined  using  the  LMTD  method.
Alternatively,  it  can  be  determined  from  the  effectiveness  NTU  method  by  first
evaluating  the  effectiveness  and  from  it  is  definition  and  then  the  NTU  from  the
appropriate NTU relations, right.(Refer Slide Time: 28:23)
 (Refer Slide Time: 28:26)
So, this is how we have done the summary and that is where we are coming to the end of
this class particularly; where we have done for NTU Number of Transfer Units in terms
of effectiveness, right. So, with this let us stop, the time is up so.
Thank you.
