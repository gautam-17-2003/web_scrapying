Log Mean Temperature Difference
So, good morning. We were discussing about the Log Mean Temperature Difference. So,
we were in the beginning of that derivation of how the log mean temperature difference
for co-current, counter current are to be determined, how the expression is developed
based on the heat transfer equation s. So, that we are continuing here, ‘right’. So, this is in
lecture number 47, we are doing log mean temperature difference, ‘right’.
 (Refer Slide Time: 01:10)
So,  let  us  quickly  look  at  where  we  were   that  is  we  started  here  that  log  mean
temperature difference I am not going to emphasize again on this. This was for counter
current and this was for co-current and this is the general equation; general equation for
heat transfer, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 01:30)So, that we had taken to dq is m -mh Ch dTh, from there we came to the point that dT h of,
we came to the point that dT h of rather d(Th - Tc) / dTh - Tc  we said that this cannot be;
this cannot be taken of the reason being one is that is 1 and other is 2, that is why that
either 1 and 2, depending on whether it is 1 and 2, this cannot be taken up. That was
made equal to -U because that dq was in terms of U, -U (1/mhCh + 1/mcCc) dA. This is
where perhaps in the last class we had stopped, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:39)
Now, if you look at this expression we can say that integrating this that dT h - dTc - Tc
over dTh over Th - Tc, ‘right’. If we integrate and put the limits and limits where 1 and 2,that is inlet and outlet, ‘right’. So, inlet and the outlet, if we do that, we can say that ln of
that sorry ln of that that ln ((Th2 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1)) is that expression, ‘right’.
So, this is equal to minus UA (1/mhCh + 1/mcCc), ‘right’. Now, assuming that total heat
transferred be q, assuming total heat transferred be q, then q = mhCh × (Th1 - Th2) that is
mass mc ΔT, ‘right’. From this, we can write this for the hot fluid and for the cold fluid
we can write mcCc (Tc1 – Tc2). Here also that at m c Δc same thing we are writing, ‘right’.
So, in both the cases here you see you can say earlier we had written minus, but here it is
there is no minus because we have taken care of the due minus T hot to 1.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:33)
If 1 is inlet and 1 is inlet and 2 is outlet if that from is implemented here, then this (Th1 -
Th2) = ΔT and this is the + ΔT; that means, h1 to h2 it is decreasing. Whereas, this is T c2 -
Tc1, cold fluid 1 which was entering is less than cold fluid 2 which is exiting is higher,
‘right’. So, Tc2 - Tc1 is also a positive one. That is why there is no negative sign. So, m h Ch
we can write this to equal to q / (Th1 - Th2) and mc Cc can be written as q / (Tc2 - Tc1) from
this relation, ‘right’.
Therefore, if we take the log we can write this equation ln (Th2 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1) which
was equal to minus UA that 1 /mcCc and mh Tm h Ch that we are now replacing, ‘right’,.
So, that is equal to  (Th1 - Th2)/q  + Th (Tc2 - Tc1)/q, ‘right’. So, this is that. So, we are
replacing this with that 1 /mhCh + 1/mcCc with this, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 06:40)
Then, we can further simplify it and already we have this side ln, so we can further
simplify and write that is equal to UA sorry that is equal to UA {(Th2 - Tc2)/q - (Tc2 - Tc1)/
q}. The reason being you see that earlier in the earlier slide we had shown that this U
was written negative, ‘right’ So, that negative we are taken care of by introducing it
inside and this is now minus, ‘right’. So, we can write q = UA {(Th2 - Tc2) - (Th1 - Tc1)},
over all ln {(Th2 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1)}, ‘right’. So, q is equal to this we can write.
Hence, log mean temperature difference that can be written as ΔT lm is nothing, but this
part, ‘right’ and this part is (Th2 - Tc2) – (Th1 - Tc1) / ln {(Th2 - Tc2) / (Th1 - Tc1)} that is the
log mean temperature difference, ‘right’. Then, we can rewrite and say that this is the log
mean temperature difference, where it is T h2 - Tc2 sorry, it is Th2 - Tc2; and Th2 - Tc2 ok.
(Refer Slide Time: 08:46)Let us look into really this is one, this is another, ‘right’, so T h1 and this is Th2 and this is
Tc2 and this is Tc1, ‘right’. And this T h1 - Tc1 is this one and Th2 - Tc2 is this one, ‘right’. So,
this is what? Say we say ΔT 2 and say this is ΔT1 ln (ΔT) it is 2 - Tc2 / Tc, Th1 - Tc1.
 (Refer Slide Time: 09:39)
Now, this can be simplified and written as T, that ΔT lm or let us write here ΔT lm  is equal
to this we can write ΔT 2 and this we can write ΔT 1 over 1n of this we can write ΔT 2 and
this we can write ΔT 1.
So, if properly they are written or the nomenclature is given, rightly then we can say that
LMTD is (ΔT2 - ΔT1) / ln (ΔT2/ΔT1) or the vice versa that ΔT lm can be written as (ΔT1 -ΔT2) / (ΔT1  - ΔT2) sorry, over ln  (ΔT1/ΔT2), ‘right’. So, this can be properly written,
‘right’. 
You see, if ΔT2 is low or less then ΔT 1, so there will be negative, but here that will also
be taken care off. So, here also you have ΔT 2  < ΔT1, the value which will come of ln
which you will have all negative so this negative and that negative will go off, ‘right’.
So, this is how ΔTlm we can write.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:32)
Now, again it comes another important thing is that LMTD correction factor. The earlier
which we have shown that LMTD, that LMTD was ΔT lm and whatever we had written
that was true for counter current or co-current, ‘right’. But if it is a cross flow like this,
‘right’, if it is a cross flow then it is not that is easy to find out for that there is a
correction factor for LMTD which has to be introduced. And what is that? So, it was
shown in plate shell and tube and cross flow heat exchangers that, the flow directions
may change from parallel to counter flow over the whole length of the heat exchangers.
For this reason, the log mean temperature has to be used with the correction factor, for
shell  and  tube  heat  exchangers  two  dimensionless  temperatures  ratios  influence  the
correction factor F as P = (Tc2 - Tc1) / (Th1 - Tc1) and Q = (Th1 -Th2) / (Tc2/Tc - Tc1) and a
product of QP is (Th1 -Th2) / (Th1 - Tc1) where all these T’s are in Kelvin, ‘right’ So, if youlook at how it is proceeding that the correction factors F, how it is proceeding we can get
it from solving problem, ‘right’.
 (Refer Slide Time: 13:46)
It  is  like  this  that,  moist  air  is  heated  from  30  ° C  to  70  °C by  hot  water  whose
temperature changes from 90 to 80 ° C. Determine the true temperature difference if the
heat exchanger is of the following type. Number 1, pure parallel flow, number 2, pure
counter flow, number 3, average temperature difference and number 4 pure cross flow
with one row of tubes. So, there is no multiples, nothing, nothing single, ‘right’.
So, I repeat moist air is heated from 30 to 70 ° C by hot water whose temperature changes
from 90 to 80 °C. Determine the true temperature difference if the heat exchanger is of
the following type, a pure parallel flow, or pure counter flow or average temperature
difference and pure cross flow with one row, ‘right’. So, first let us try with the parallel
flow, ‘right’.
So, if the parallel flow means as we have shown this is the axis, this is the length axis,
this is the temperature, ‘right’. Then the flow direction is like this, ‘right’. And we had
taken a volume element from where why extension we have done this equation, ‘right’.
So, we got LMTD was equal to delta T m or normally mean or log mean it is written lm.
So, it is (ΔT2 – ΔT1) / ln (ΔT2/ ΔT1). And in this given problem, we have been given T h1 is90 °C, Th2 is 80 °C for hot fluid and T c1 is 30 °C and Tc2 is 70 °C for moist air or we can
write cold fluid, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:42)
So, if this is true, then we can write for parallel flow T h1 = 90°, Tc1 = 30°, so ΔT1 = 60°.
So, Th1 = 90°, Tc1 = 30°, so this is the ΔT 1, ‘right’. And Th2  is 80°, so this one is 80° and
Tc2 = 70°, so this one is 72°. So, their difference is ΔT 2 = 10 °C. So, that ΔT1 came to be
60 and this ΔT2 came to be 10°.
(Refer Slide Time: 17:51)
Then ΔTmean or log mean we can write is 10 that T 2 ΔT2 – ΔT1. So, 10 - 60, ‘right’. Let us
erase. (10 – 60) / ln (10 / 60), ‘right’. So, (10 – 60) is -50 and if you take 10 / 60 that is 1
/ 6 ln (1/6) that will have some value with negative. 
So, this two negative will go off and ΔT lm as come up to be 27.9 ° C. This you can also
check with your calculator, ‘right’. Since, we have cannot do it here with the calculator
were perhaps we can also do, but yes let me check whether we have, yes, we have a
calculator here.
(Refer Slide Time: 18:42)
So, if we have a calculator here. So, we can write view scientific, yes. So, if that be true
then if we see this, ‘right’, we can say that this was 10 minus this will go. So, 10 - 60 that
was minus 50 over again 10 / 60. So, you see this has become 0.2166. And if we take its
ln then it is -1.0. So, earlier we had -50 on the numerator, so dividing this becomes 27.9°,
‘right’. So that means, we have, ‘right’ly are correctly done which you also have seen it
we have checked it, ‘right’. So, 27.9  °C is the ΔT log mean for parallel flow. 
(Refer Slide Time: 20:05)For counter flow we can write here. So, this is the flow direction, this is the flow
direction, ‘right’ and this is T h1, this is Th2, this is Tc1, this is Tc2, a T vs L plot we have,
‘right’. So, in that since T h1 is 90, Tc2 is 70. So, Th1 is 90, Tc2 is 70 and ΔT1 we can write to
be 90 - 70. So, this was 90 and outlet of c told was 70, so ΔT if we say one that ΔT 1 is 20,
‘right’. Similarly, T h2 is 80, that is Th2 is 80 and Tc1 is 30. 
So, Tc1 is 30, so ΔT2 that is this one is 80 - 30 that is 50, ‘right’ that is 50. So, 50 and 20 is
correct. Now, we can write ΔT log mean ΔT lm = (50 – 20) / ln (50/20). That is, if we
again see that with the help of a calculator, if we again see then we can see that 50 - 20 is
equal to 30, ‘right’ divided by, so we have 50 /20, ‘right’. This will be taken ln, so that is
this one. So, if we divide, so that is 32.7, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 21:57)
So, we got 32.7 as the ΔT log mean for counter current, ‘right’. So, for counter count we
got 32.7 °C as the log mean temperature difference, ‘right’. Now, third one was available
temperature. So, average temperature of the hot fluid is what? So, this was T h1 and this
was Th2. So, Th1 was 90 and Th2 was 80. So, average of that is 85 ° C. So, average
temperature of the inlet or fluid is 85 ° C.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:29)
Similarly, average of the cold fluid is this was exit 30° inlet was sorry inlet was 30, exit
was 70. So, 70 + 30, 100 / 2 is 50 °C, ‘right’. So, we have inlet 85 exit 50. So, (85 - +50)/
2 that is or we can say simply already we have done that average.
(Refer Slide Time: 24:05)
So,  this  can  be  the  average  temperature  is  average  delta  T,  average  temperature
difference is ΔT 85 - 50 that is 35 °C, ‘right’. 35 °C is the average temperature difference
because we have taken the average of the in hot fluid, we also have taken the average of
cold fluid. So, the difference is the average of the hot and cold fluid, ‘right’. So, that is
what average temperature we have seen.(Refer Slide Time: 24:56)
Then it is remaining that is 4th. Fourth one was that what is the temperature for LMTD.
For the cross flow cross now for flow we have F = ΔTlm or mean over ΔTm cross flow or
mean temperature log mean temperature for cross flow that is the F. 
So, if that be true we can write ln ((1 – P)/(1-QP)) for this and ΔTm cf is (Q – 1) ln ( Q /
(Q + ln (1 – QP))), ‘right’, where P = (Tc2 - Tc1) / (Th1 - Tc1) and Q = (Th1 – Th2) / (Tc2 -
Tc1), ‘right’ and QP is (Th1 – Th2) / (Th1 - Tc1).
(Refer Slide Time: 26:18)
So, with all this parameters let us substitute the values and we get that P = (70 – 30)/(90
– 30) that is 0.67. Q = (90 – 80) / (70 – 30) that is 0.25. And then F = ln ((1- 0.67)/(1 -
0.1675)) / (0.25 - 0.1) × ln (0.25 / (0.25 + ln(1-0.167))) which comes on simplification as
minus on the numerator -0.925 and on the denominator -0.991. So, this ratio comes to be
0.933, ‘right’.
So, the mean temperature difference that can be written as ΔT lm, ‘right’ equal to F× ΔTm,cf
= ΔTlm cross flow. So, ΔT lm cross flow that is then it is 32.7 4, ‘right’, 32.7 4 ×  0.933
that is 30.54 °C, ‘right’. So, ΔTm has become 30.54, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:08)
So, out of this 4 we see that ΔT counter current, ‘right’, that gave a value which is very
very good, but that was very close to the average, ΔT average. Since, the temperature
differences were small, so Δ Tlm values were not that significantly different. But if the
ΔTm is or rather if the difference of temperatures are very high then definitely the on the
ΔTlm or LMTD that will be highly appreciated. 
So, that is why when the difference is high Δ Tlm is taken and if the difference is less, then
the average temperature (T1 + T2) / 2 or ΔT of hot - ΔT of cold is taken as the average
temperature, ‘right’. (Refer Slide Time: 29:03)
So, with this for the log mean temperature difference finding out, since the time is over.
So, let us call it a day that LMTD for counter current, co-current and for the cross flow
we have found out with a numerical value, ‘right’. And we have also shown with the
calculator on the screen that the things which we have collected corrected or which we
have done were correct, ‘right’. So, with this let us end this class. Stop this class here.
Thank you.
