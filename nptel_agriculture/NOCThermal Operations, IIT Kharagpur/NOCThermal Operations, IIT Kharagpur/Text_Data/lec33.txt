Lecture - 33
Heat Transfer by Convection (Contd.)
Good morning. So, we are doing some problems on the application of the relations which
we have given, ‘right’ and this is lecture number 33.
(Refer Slide Time: 00:41)
Yeah we are doing it; I think this one will give you the problem and I wish that you solve
it. And if you are not able to solve then only on the next maybe next to next class or
some other classes, we will come back to this solution and then you can and that time we
will of course, do hurriedly. May not be directly with the convection by that time if it is
over; then because I will show give you some time so that you can do it ok.
So, the problem is that it is a also similar to the relations which we have handled; that hot
fluid with the mass flow rate of 2000 kg/h, passes through a pipe having diameter of 25
mm and thickness of 2.5 mm. What will be the film heat transfer coefficient if properties
of the fluid are as follows; k is equal to 0.5 W/m.°C, viscosity mu is 1× 10-3 N.s/m2 ρ=
1000 kg/m3; if average temperature of the fluid is 30 °C and the quantity of heat flow is
300 W/m; what is the average temperature of the pipe wall? Second, what will be the film heat transfer coefficient if the flow rate decreases to 1000
kg/h; it was 2000 kg/h, now it is 1000 kg/h keeping all other conditions identical or
same. Third what will be the film heat transfer coefficient if the diameter of the tube is
reduced to 12.5 mm keeping again all other condition same, ‘right’. So, this solution you
do and if you are not able to then we will come back to a solution after some time,
‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 03:39)
So, now let us go to free convection ok; free or natural convection till now we have
handled with forced convection, ‘right’. And free or natural convection by definition it is
due to the buoyancy or density difference; the flow is happening and there is a heat
exchange, ‘right’. 
So, generally the simple correlations are like this that there is a number called Rayleigh
number which is Ra; may be in terms of del, i.e., thickness is equal to Grashof number;
in  terms  of  again  del  thickness  into  Prandtl  number.  So,  this  comes  to  be
23chδδv)δTgββ(PrGrRa .
And Nu in terms of , Nu that is not Nu; Nu that is, Nusselt number in terms of is
mnHRacNuwhere H and m deviously these are the two constants which are tobe determined, ‘right’.  is the thickness of the fluid, ‘right’; so this Nusselt number is

HRan, where Ra is Grashof number into Prandtl number as we said,   is the
thickness of the fluid layers in annulus; it is D o/Di thickness is (Do-Di)/ 2, H is the height
of the fluid layer.
Once  the  Nusselt  number  is  computed;  the  mean  heat  transfer  coefficient  h m is
determined from its definition as δkNuhδm ‘right’. Nusselt number is equal to h / k
or hm / k; hm / k. Total transfer of heat Q rate across the fluid layer for a given h m is;
)T(ThAQchmm, where the mean area A m depends on the geometry like plane layer
Am is Aw or wall area.
Cylindrical  annulus,
ioiomAAlnAAA;  outside  area  over  in  inner  area.  For  spherical
annulus it is iomAAA. For fluid continue contained in a horizontal enclosed space
where  the  viscous  forces  overcome  the  buoyancy  forces.  And  the  fluid  remained
motionless as a result the heat transfer across the fluid layer is by pure conduction.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:50)
And the Nusselt number can be defined as; Nusselt number can be defined as this that
chchTThδTTk or  1khδNuδ, ‘right’, where  is the thickness; it should be
I S is the thickness of the fluid layer and the temperature difference is sufficiently small. 
For more accurate empirical correlations, for free natural convection in enclosures are
like this. What we have? Here is that system; system is this we have an enclosure which
has a height equal to H, thickness equal to . And with the plane this is 90°; phi is 90°,
hot surface is at Th this is the hot surface; at T h and the cold surface is at T c; this is the
cold surface, ‘right’. 
So, under this condition; if it is a vertical layer that like this if it is a vertical layer, let
aspect ratio is H / is equal to a, ‘right’ H/  is the aspect ratio is a; where H is the
height of the fluid and is the thickness of the fluid. Experimentally for air; a is equal to
5 to 110 and72δ102 to10Ra. 
So, there natural or free convective heat transfer was determined or were determined.
And correlations proposed are like this  max32190Nu,Nu,NuNuo  means any one of Nu 1,
Nu2 or Nu3 maximum of that is the Nusselt number. So that means, you need to know
Nu1, Nu2 and Nu3, ‘right’. So, from there you select one maxNu or Nusselt number max
where, 3/11065.0RaNu. 
3/13

RaRaNu .
And  0.272
3aRa0.024Nu ,‘right’;  a  is  the  aspect  ratio,  H/ ;
Pr
vδTTgβPrGrRa23chδ , ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 12:33)
So, knowing this; this is a relation for free convection or natural convection. The Nusselt
number is defined as   4.3073.0δHRa0.073Nu1/91/3900 
 perhaps this we have
done as the solution, ‘right’. 
Two square vertical parallel plates of dimension 0.5 m by 0.5 m; separated by a distance
is equal to 5 cm contains air. One plate is at 400 and the other plate is at 300 K;
calculate the rate of heat transfer by the free convection across the airspace and compare
this Nusselt number and the one obtained with approximation, ‘right’.
So,  given  the  properties  of  air  at  350  K  is.  s v /m 10076.225 ,
/sm 102.983α25 .  -13K 1086.2350/1 . And k = 0.03 W/m.°C, ‘right’.
Now, H/; H is 0.5 m,  is 5 cm, ‘right’. So, 0.5/0.05, ‘right’ is equal to 10 ‘right’. So,
from this relation; if Rayleigh number can be found out I think this was found out. So, it
came out to be Nusselt number to be 3.79 simply. (Refer Slide Time: 15:32)
But if we want to see that Nu 1, Nu2 which we have done if we want to see that, then we
have  to  find  out  like  this  that  the /Prv,
   )10983.2)(10076.2/()05.0)(300400)(1086.28.9(/553 3 2    vTTgRach
. So, it comes to5104.3.
Aspect ratio or a found to be; a=H/  ‘right’. So, H/ was the aspect ratio equal to 0.5/
0.005  so;  that  means,  it  is  10.  So,  from  1;
4.22103.40.06050.0605RaNu0.335 1/31  ,  ‘right’.  So,  Rayleigh  number  we
have found out5104.3; so this came to be 4.22. Now, Nu 2 that is in the second these
are more accurate ‘right’; we said Nusselt number you find out either in terms of Nusselt
number 1 or 2 or 3 in any three expressions and whatever is the max that you take,
‘right’.
So, Nusselt number 2 was more complicated was 1 plus by substituting the values,
expression  already  we  had  shown  earlier;  I  am  not  repeating  here.  So,1/33

6310/Ra10.104Ra1


 .  So,  this  on  simplification  gives

1/33

  ,‘right’. 
So, this on simplification gives 4.36, ‘right’ and the third one which would like to do is
Nusselt number equal to  272.0
024.0
aRa and this is equal to  272.05
10104.3024.0
and the aspect ratio we found out to be 10; so by 10; so this is equal to 4.13. So, out of
these three; 4.22, 4.36 and 4.13; we see that Nu 2 is equal to 4.36 is the max; so Nu max is
equal to 4.36, ‘right’.
Now, once we have the Nu max; we use Nu90 that is because you are set the vertical. So,
4.36)Tk(TqδNu
ch90 .  So,  Nusselt  number  we  are  taking  4.36  and
4.36)Tk(TqδNu
ch90 . From there 
δkTT4.36qch,‘right’. 
And this is equal to 
0.0503.00030044.36q  is 261.6 W/m2. So, q the flux heat flux
we got 261.6 W/m2. So, to know the total Q; we must know q × A, ‘right’. So, this is the
flux and if area is multiplied; then we know the total heat flow or heat rate flow rate.
So, total transfer rate across the gap is capital Q = q × area and that becomes equal to this
we have got 261.6 times;  area  we had a plate,  ‘right’. So, plate  means  it has  two
dimensions given 0.5 and 0.5,‘right’. So, the area becomes 0.5 into 0.5; so 0.52.(Refer Slide Time: 23:36)
So, that becomes equal to 65.4 W; so Q we found out to be 65.4 W. So, this is according
to the best relation we have, ‘right’; we used Nu is equal to Nu 1, Nu2, Nu3; out of which
the maximum we have taken we saw Nu 2 was the maximum, ‘right’. And this is the
accurate way of determining the heat transfer or rate or heat transfer coefficient or
Nusselt number whatever we call.
Now, we had seen in the beginning; there is a very simple correlation for Nusselt,
number  for  vertical  plate  like  that.  So,  it  is
 51/91/390 104.3073.0δHRa0.073Nu0 
, ‘right’; 1/9
δH
. And this becomes
0.073 Rayleigh number; 3.4; 105. We have already found out 1 by 3 means 0.33 times H
by δ; that is 10 to the power – 1/9 is -0.11; which came out to be 3.79. So, 3.79 in this
case and in this case we got 4.36, ‘right’; so the difference is less than 15%.
So, the accurate one which we have done is more than 15% of the approximate one;
whereas, in the approximate one you can do it and remember also the relation very easily
as  /)(073.03/1HRa; that is aspect H by a or h by  δ that is aspect ratio to the
power -1/9 ‘right’, that came to be 3.79, ‘right’.
So, this is less than 15% from the accurate one, ‘right’ and I; I think we had also seen in
the previous slide something like this yeah. So, this was the more simple, ‘right’ the9/13/1/)(073.0HRa . So, when we saw that we thought that what suddenly to us;
so this was the solution of this problem. So, 0.073 × 3.4 that was found out after was in
the next slide we got it that Rayleigh number is 3.4×105, to the power 0.33 and H/ δthat
is aspect ratio to the power -0.11 or -1/ 9. So, it came out to be 3.79, ‘right’.
So, this is how if we look at that this was for free convection; we can utilize the relations
to find out free convection and the solution of the free convection, ‘right’. So, I hope we
have come across the convection more or less and conduction more or less very much
thoroughly. And since we are also going very fast; I mean fast in the sense what time is
also going out, so we have other things to cover. So, next class we will try to go into the
radiation, ‘right’.
Thank you.
