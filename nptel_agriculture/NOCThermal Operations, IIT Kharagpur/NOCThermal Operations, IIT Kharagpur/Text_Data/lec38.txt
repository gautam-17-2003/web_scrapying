Lecture - 38
Heat Transfer by Radiation (Contd.)
Good morning. So, you were continuing addition heat transfer. Now we are in the lecture
number 38. So, it should be Radiation Heat Transfer continued, ’right’. So, we have seen
that when there are 2 parallel plates and there was a shield in between then what is the
radiation due to that shield whether that shield is really reducing the heat transfer rate or
not that we have seen and with problem also we have found out that the reduction is
substantial around 10 to 12 times or even more depending on the values of emissivities,
’right’.
We have also seen that if that was for parallel plate, but we also have seen for cylindrical
or spherical shaped objects or surfaces where the surface area was varying that was A 1,
A2 and A3, ’right’ 2 surfaces A 1 and A2. So, in between the shield was given A 3 and with
that the expression for the heat transfer rate that we have determined, ’right’. Now, again
look a let us look into some problem. So, that we are confident about the development,
’right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 02:18)
So, problem is like this that 2 parallel plates at temperatures T 1 and T2, at temperatures T 1
and T2 and have emissivities ɛ 1 and ɛ2 where ɛ1 is 0.9 and ɛ2 is 0.4. A radiation shield
having the same emissivity has epsilon 3 on both sides is placed between the plates. So,
ɛ3 is not given, ’right’. Calculate the emissivity ɛ 3 of the shield if the reduction in
radiation loss from the system is aimed at 10% of the same without the shield, ’right’.
So, now what we are saying that yes we have 2 parallel plates and we have put one shield
in between and the emissivities of these 2 parallel plates are known. And the emissivity
of the shield is not known, but it is said that the emissivity on both the sides are same of
the shield that is the assumption.
That the shield has on the both the sides the same emissivities and the parallel plates
emissivities are given. Now, it is required that by putting that shield you want to reduce
the heat loss by 10%, ’right’ heat loss to 10% not by 10% heat loss to 10% you want to
bring down, ’right’ and if that then what should be the value of emissivity of the shield,
’right’ this is the problem.
(Refer Slide Time: 04:55)
So, the solution of it if you want to see that this means the ratio Q 1 is to Qo that is with
and without shield that should be 110, ’right’ that is what we have been said that the ratio
of  Q1 to  Qo should  be  10%  or  110,  ’right’.  So,  the  ratio  if  we  put

 this is with shield and without shield is

.
Here only one thing we are achieving that the area of the parallel plates and that of the
shield are same, ’right’.
Area of the parallel plates and that of the shield are same this is what we are assuming,
’right’. Then this ratio comes down to because your this part goes up with this part,
’right’ and then only we have this denominator goes on the top 1/ɛ 1 + 1/ɛ2 - 1. 
And , the new that this denominator that remains that is 1/ɛ 1 + 1/ɛ2 - 1 + 1/ɛ3 + 1/ɛ3 - 1 this
should be 1/ɛ1,3 and 1/ɛ3,2, ’right’. Typically it should be 1/ɛ 3,1 and 1/ɛ1,3 the typical should
be 1, 3 and that is 3, 2. So, that ɛ 3 is not known we have to find out.
(Refer Slide Time: 07:43) 
 (Refer Slide Time: 07:55)
And, this ratio is 1/10, ’right’. If this be true then let us solve it and find out that this is
nothing, but 1/10 is [1/Ɛ 1 + 1/Ɛ2 – 1] / [1/Ɛ1 +(1/Ɛ2 – 1)+( 1/Ɛ3 + 1/Ɛ3 -1)] if we simplify
that as 1/Ɛ3 -1 that is the values are given of Ɛ 1 and 2 (1/0.9 + 1/0.4 – 1) here also 1/0.9 +
1/0.4 – 1 and this is nothing, but (2 - Ɛ 1) / Ɛ3 sorry (2 – Ɛ3) / Ɛ3, ’right’.
So, this on simplification we can write that 2.61 because this value has become 26.1,
’right’. This value has become 26.1 so, 26.1 because that is here, no this value has
become 2.61 not 26 2.61. So, 2.61 × 10 ,’right’ so, this into this 2.61 × 10 that is 26.1.
(Refer Slide Time: 09:39)
And, this side when we are taken here this is 2.61. So, 2.61 Ɛ 3 2.61 Ɛ3 and this is not
minus this should be plus. So, plus 2 2 - Ɛ 3, ’right’ is 26.1, ’right’. So, we can write 26.1
this is over Ɛ3 26.1 Ɛ3, ’right’ and 26.1 Ɛ 3 yeah 26.1 Ɛ3 -  2.61 this 2.61 Ɛ3 and this is plus
Ɛ3. So, minus Ɛ3 this is equals to 2. 
So, it is plus not minus, ’right’. So, this becomes the equal to 26 minus 2.6 minus 1 26
minus 2.61 minus 1. So, 2 by that is Ɛ 3 and that is coming 0.088. So, the values of Ɛ 3 is
0.088, ’right’. If this emissivity value is so low then you can bring down the lost or by
addition to it is without the shield whatever is the loss, you can bring down it to 1/10th of
that, ’right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 11:42)
So, that means, in other words if we had these two shields which has one emissivity of
0.9 and the other emissivity of 0.4 if this is there then whatever heat loss Q was there
without the shield the value of that we do not know. But, now you are asked that 2 tear
shield of the same area all 3 have the same area A ,’right’ and put a shield or bring the
same area where the Q shield normally we are expressing is at Q 1 ,’right’
So, this Q shield over Q o  that must be equals to 1/10. So, these two values are known
what is the value of this Ɛ 3 this is the problem which we have emphasized and we have
solved  it  that  the  value  comes  to  0.088  Ɛ,’right’.  So  that  means,  you  see  that  the
reduction in radiation by putting the shield can be so, drastic,’right’.(Refer Slide Time: 13:20)
Next let us  look into  another problem. This  is  a really  handy problem that a cryo
container. Now in this regard let me also give a little I do not say it is preamble a little
information more that cryo containers are like that which are normally double walled,
’right’, like this they are double walled they have a neck here actually should have been
like this much more. Sorry. 
So, actually it should have been like this, ’right’. So, there is 11 1 1 stopper cork here,
’right’. There is 1 stopper cork here and this double wall is may be under vacuum or
some inserting material. So, inside there are cryogen. Now cryogen means say liquid air,
liquid  helium,  liquid  nitrogen,  liquid  oxygen  all  these  are  called  cryogen,  ’right’,
temperature of who which are may be 150 °C - 170, 180, 190, 200 or helium temperature
is 4 K helium temperature is 4 K.
So, they are kept under this kind of double wall system like the thermo plus you have a
similar one, but with much much better insulation ,’right’. So, these things are to be kept
inside. This is the solution of that kind of problem ,’right’. So, you have a double wall
container and you want to put a shield in between such that the radiation heat loss is
minimum such that the because of the heat loss heat which is coming in the liquid is boil
off and then that comes out of this ,’right’. 
So, that comes of this and this is what if you keep may be normally we handle say 26
litre container or 55 litre container. So, say if it is a 26 litre container by 3 4 days or even1 week if we keep this liquid unused with that cork on the top there is a movable and if
you are keeping it like that. So, by 7 days this boils off and it becomes empty, ’right’.
That means a continuous heat is being flown, ’right’. So, this is the similar problem I get
the little preamble of that. So, that understanding becomes more and easier.
(Refer Slide Time: 16:44)
So, a cryo container having diameter D i 50 cm and Do 70 cm continuing a cryogenic
liquid such as liquid nitrogen at temperature 77 K, ’right’ 77 K means somewhere minus
196 °C  ,’right’. So, you think such a low boiling liquid is inside. Outside temperature of
the container that is atmospheric temperature T 2 is 300 K, ’right’ normal 300 K means
somewhat 27 °C that is a room temperature, ’right’. 
The emissivities of the inner and outer tanks Ɛ 1 is 0.1 and Ɛ2 is 0.2 respectively, ’right’.
So, this is the similar problem as we had given you like this ,’right’; so, similar problem.
So, now, what do you need? You are now a spherical radiation shield having a diameter
D3 is equals to 60 cm with an emissivity of Ɛ 3 equals to 0.05 on both the surfaces. So,
new this one is put which has emissivity Ɛ 3 on both sides this phase also that phase also,
’right’.(Refer Slide Time: 18:36)
So, if that is put that the 0.05 on both the surfaces is placed between the 2 cylindrical
walls. Calculate the rate of heat loss from the system by radiation and also calculate the
rate of evaporation of the cryogen that is liquid nitrogen if h fg that is latent heat of
vaporization is for say liquid nitrogen is 2 × 105 W.s/K W.s/K means watt is J/s and there
is another second per not Kelvin this is kg sorry that g is missing, ’right’ g is missing
somewhat type of mistake.
(Refer Slide Time: 19:42)
So, it should be kg not k W.s/kg means what are joules per second and you have a
second. So, it is J/kg normally that is the thing J/kg, ’right’. So, 200 kJ, ’right’ 200 kJ/ kg
is the latent heat of vaporization of liquid nitrogen, ’right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 20:23)
So, what we need to do we what do we need to find out. We have to find out that the heat
loss from the system by radiation after giving the shield and we have to find out even
after giving the shield what is the; this is called boil off, ’right’ this is called boil off. So,
what is the boil off of the cryogen that is liquid nitrogen, ’right’. So, rapidly we go
through  the  problem  once  again  a  cryo container  having  D i 50  cm  and  Do 70  cm
continuing a cryogenic liquid that is liquid nitrogen at temperature T 1 77 K outside
temperature of the container is at T 2 equal to 300 K.
The emissivities of the inner and outer tanks are Ɛ 1  = 0.1 and Ɛ2  = 0.2 respectively.
Spherical radiation shield having a diameter D 3 = 6 cm with an emissivity of Ɛ 3 = 0.05 on
both the sides or both the surfaces is placed between the 2 cylindrical walls.
Calculate the rate of heat loss from the system by radiation and also calculate that
calculate is not written also calculate the rate of evaporation of liquid nitrogen if h fg that
is latent heat of vaporization of liquid nitrogen given is 2 ×105 W.s/kg, ’right’. So, to
solve it let us take that radiation heat loss with shield and that is Q 1 equals to A1 σ (T14 -
T24) because diameters are different D i is 50 Do is 70 and D3 is 60, ’right’ 3 diameters are
there. So, the areas are also different A 1, A2 and A3 they are all different, ’right’.So, we are we need to find out areas and the expression for Q is Q 1 equals to A1 σ (T14-
T24) / 1/ σ 1 / Ɛ1 + (A1 / A2) × (1 / Ɛ2 – 1) + (A1 / A3) × (1 / Ɛ3,1 +1 / Ɛ3,2 – 1)+ 1 / Ɛ3,2 – 1 so,
much Watt, ’right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 23:27)
So, if we now find out the solution that Q 1 is nothing, but the areas first A 1 and A2. We
have to find out, ’right’. So, diameters are given. So, area is A 1 = πD2, ’right’. So, πD2 if
that is there then we find out A 1  to be π × 0.52 ,’right’ and σ is 5.67 × 10-8 Stefan
Boltzmann constant and T 1 is 77 K. So, 774 and T2 is atmospheric temperature that is 300
K so, 3004.(Refer Slide Time: 24:28)
Divided by Ɛ1 given is 1/0.1 Ɛ1 is 0.1, ’right’ and + 5/72 5/72 that is A1/A2 A1/A2 since it is
πD2. So, we have π going out. So, it was A 1 was 5 and A2 was 7. So, 5/ 7 square or A 1
was whatever 50 and 70, ’right’ 50 and 70. So, 0 goes out π (5/7)2, ’right’ and into 1/ Ɛ 2,
i.e., 0.2 – 1  that is this part.
(Refer Slide Time: 25:24)
This part is A1/A3, ’right’ A1 is 50 and A3 was 60 cm. So, that becomes 5 by 6 ratio
square ,’right’ and this times 1/0.005 that is the Ɛ 3 + 1 by point 0 0 0.05 not point 00
1/0.05 + 1/0.05 – 1, ’right’. So, this comes equals to minus 359.14 / 29.12, ’right’. So,this is minus 12.33 Watt, ’right’. So, that Q is minus 12.33 watt; that means, heat is not
going out heat is coming in, ’right’. So, we have this. This is called dewar. These are
called dewar d e w a r. So, in the dewar the heat is not going out Q 1 is not going out Q 1 is
coming in, ’right’ that is why it is the negative 12.33 Watt, ’right’ so.
We have 12.33 watts of the Q which is penetrating into the dewar. So, what is the
evaporation rate then we know h fg and hfg was 2 × 105 W.s/kg here we have corrected
per kg there it was if you remember only small k was there g did not come in. So, Q 1 /
hfg is this is 12.33 and the h fg is 2 2 × 105.  
So, that is 6.2 × 10-5; so, much kg/s, ’right’. This Watt, this Watt goes out this second
remains and this kg goes on the numerator. So, kg per second 6.2 × 10-5 kg/s; so, you
convert it into per day we will see it is also some kg.
(Refer Slide Time: 28:18)
So, that becomes 6.2 × 10-5, ’right’ into 3,600 is hour into 24. So, that becomes so much
kg/day, ’right’ and you will see that per day it will be losing some 8 to 10 kg or even
more or 7 to 8 kg or even more. So, that is the loss of from the dewar. This is a great
example which is a online example or practical example we are giving, ’right’.
So, with this we come to the end of the topic perhaps radiation, ’right’. So, we come to
the end of the topic radiation. So, you do problems and solution and wish you all the
best.Thank you.
