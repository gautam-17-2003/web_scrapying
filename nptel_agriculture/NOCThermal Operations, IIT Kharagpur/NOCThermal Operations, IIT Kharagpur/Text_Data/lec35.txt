Heat Transfer by Radiation (Contd.)
 So, we are in the process of Radiation Heat Transfer, ‘right’. We have done a little on
preamble. I do not say preamble some understanding of the radiation. If we look at more
in a little detail and we have seen that a Stefan Boltzmann constant is one of the primary.
So, this is lecture number 35 under radiation heat transfer. 
(Refer Slide Time: 00:55)
So, if you look at the electromagnetic spectrum, this is explicitly for a for understanding
a real thing this is that this is under visible, ‘right’ visible wave length that this lambda is
micrometer you see 10-5, to 10-4, -3, -2, -1 10, 0, there is 1, 10, 102, 103, 104. 
So, -5 to -4 and here we are saying that electromagnetic radiation covers a wide range of
wavelength from 10-10 µm for cosmic rays to 1010 µm for electrical power waves, ‘right’.
Out of which you see gamma rays are within this range, -4 to -5. Then X-rays are
between -2 to -4 in µm ultra violet rays are somewhere between say 1 to 10-2 within that
range and between 0.1 to 1 is our visible range, ‘right’ 0.1 to 1 is our visible range out of
which the lowest is violet and the highest is red, ‘right’.So, violet, blue, green, yellow, red, red, vibgyor, ‘right’ so, indigo is in between; so, this
is the visible range and the thermal radiation range is within that that is 0.1 to 102 that is
under thermal radiation. Whereas, infrared is between somewhere say 1 or a little bit low
less than 1 to 102 or 100 and micro wave is between 102 to 103 and half, ‘right’ between
less than 104. 
So, this is how the electromagnetic spectrum that is looked into ‘right’. This is more than
radiation for information so that you have the idea of the spectra of the electromagnetic
radiation or spectrum, ‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 04:09)
Now, let us look into a problem that a mass of gas at 600 K, ‘right’ and at 600 K, ‘right’
this is ɛgas corrected which will come afterwards is 0.19 10 to the power one 0.19 ×1.35
that is 0.256 which will come at the end. 
A mass of gas at 600 K and the total pressure of 1.5 atmosphere contains 10% water
vapor over a path length of 0.8 m. Calculate the emissivity of the gas given from a graph
of emissivity that is E gas E g of water vapor at a total pressure of one atmosphere for the
gas temperature of 600 K and p wL of 0.12 to be 0.19, ‘right’. So, p w is water vapor
pressure times L, so, p wL that it is meter atmosphere which will see afterwards, ‘right’. 
So, from a  graph of the  emissivity  so, epsilon  g versus  this  p wL we find that  the
emissivity is 0.19, ‘right’. So, we have to find out that the emissivity of the gas becausethis Eg water vapor at total pressure of 1 atmosphere has been found out has been given
as 0.19. So, what will be when our pressure and a total pressure of 1.5 atmosphere
having 10% water vapor, ‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 06:30)
So, the value which we have gotten epsilon g from the graph, ɛ g as 0.19, that is not the
actual one because, we need a pressure correction, ‘right’. So, the partial pressure of
water vapor in the gas mass is p w equal to 0.1×1.5 because 10 point 10% water vapor is
equal to 0.15 atmosphere because total pressure is 1.5 out of which 10 % is water vapor.
So, it is 0.1×1.5 is 0.15. 
Then, the factor pwL for water vapor that becomes equal to pwL=0.15; the distance was
0.8, ‘right’ path length was 0.8 m. So, 0.15 × 0.8 is 0.12 m atmosphere, ‘right’. Given
emissivity is at a total pressure of 1 atmosphere. Hence a correction for pressure is to be
done incorporated from the graph of the average of partial pressure of water and a total
pressure of 0.825 atmosphere versus a correction factor for a value of pwL equal to 0.12
atmosphere which is about 1.35. 
Once we know this correction factor from the graph we can correct it as ɛ g correction =
0.19 which is the value we obtain for 1 atmosphere and the corrected to the pressure is
1.35. So, 0.19 ×1.35 is 0.256. So, the ɛ has become 0.256.(Refer Slide Time: 08:51)
If you remember we had said that the value emissivity value that varies between 0 to 1,
earlier in the last class we had said. So, it is never more than 1, ‘right’ and cannot also be
equivalent to negative. 
(Refer Slide Time: 09:08)
So, after this problem let us look into this. This is also another very good example which
in many cases we come across, ‘right’. Here we have taken a plate 1 and 2. So, this is
plate 1, this is plate 2. Plate 1 is at a temperature of T 1 with emissivity of ɛ 1 and a area ofA; plate 2 is temperature T 2 emissivity a ɛ2 and area A and we have kept a shield, this is
called radiation shield, ‘right’. 
So, we have kept a shield radiating shield where both the phases they are at temperature
T3, but emissivity’s are different at one phase it is 3, 1 and another phase it is 3, 2 this is
this phasing 2, this is phasing 1. But, all are having the same area A because this same
plate we are putting in all three, ‘right’. 
So, in this case the general governing equation is 

Qo so much Watt and
there been no shield, ‘right’, without shield it would have appeared like this. Now, let us
define one factor called J or normally known as radiosity or that is the radiation emitted
by a surface plus radiation reflected by a surface. So, emission plus reflection together is
the J or radiosity, ‘right’. So, that J once we so, that is what here we are making J and J
this is J1, so, J3,2; J2; J3,1, ‘right’.
And Eb let us define that to be a black body emissive power E b. So, it is plate 1 that is E b1
it is plate 2, Eb2 and this is the shield E b3, ‘right’. So, ɛ is the emissivity and F which
comes here also F which is nothing, but view factor means how much is visible a view
factor that is also very much important. That we have a plane like this out of which some
portion is this portion is may be visible, but back side some are not visible. So, in that
case the view factor comes in. 
So, view factor is F 1,3 that is this F1,3 between this and F 3,2 between this, ‘right’ is assume
to be one for large parallel plates, ‘right’. If these be true then this situation can easily be
related as that Q quantity of heat is coming ‘right’ Q quantity of heat is coming and first
is coming to this plate number 1. So, that we are denoting it to be this E b1 that is causing
a resistance. So, this we can easily relate like the electrical resistance analogy or thermal
resistance analogy, ‘right’. 
So, a resistance equivalent to

2,31


A. So, all these distances are there and if we this is
the electrical resistance analogy or thermal resistance analogy as we have done earlier in
conduction, ‘right’.
(Refer Slide Time: 15:02)
So, if we look at the solution of it the heat transfer rate Q across the system with one
shield because we had given only one shield this was plate 1; this was plate 2 and this is
the shied that 

happened how? 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:12)
If we if we simplify this one then it becomes ɛ 3,1 - ɛ3 ɛ3,1-1/ɛ3,1. So, it becomes 1/ɛ 3,1 – 1,
‘right’. Similarly, from here this can be that 1 - ɛ 3,2, ‘right’. So, this way 1/ɛ 3,2, no the
other way it will be; it will be like this. 
(Refer Slide Time: 17:54)
1/ɛ3,2 - 1; this is from here and this one also 1/ɛ 3,1 – 1, ‘right’. So, if this two minus is a
taken care of that is how it is 1/ ɛ 1 + 1/ ɛ2 - 1and 1/ɛ3,1 from here and 1/ɛ 3,2  from here
minus that another 1, ‘right’ this is how it came up. 
(Refer Slide Time: 18:32)
So, this can be now equated that Q 1 is nothing, but if there are if emissivity of all
surfaces are equal, ‘right’ that is all surfaces emissivitys are equal that is ɛ 1 = ɛ2 = ɛ3,1
everything all are coming equal. Then we can write if there are n number of shields
having equal surface emissivity that will come, but if there equal then it comes to be
equal to Q1 equal to a 


 because we said all if emissivity of all surfaces are
equal, ‘right’. So, that equal if that be equivalent to epsilon, ‘right’.
Then this is 1/ɛ + this is 1/ɛ, ‘right’ -1 this is also 1/ɛ this is 1/ɛ 1. So, -1 - 1, 2, so, here
we have taken 2 common here also we got 1/ɛ 1/ɛ that is 2/ɛ. Here also we got 1/ɛ 1/ɛ
2/ɛ.
So, 2 if we take common then 2/ɛ - 1 is the Q 1, if all have the same emissivity epsilon,
‘right’. That is for a single emission shield, ‘right’ we had two plates in between singleemission sheet, then if they all have the same emissivity then we can write simplified for
a of the heat transfer rate as 

(Refer Slide Time: 21:04)
Then it comes it was for a single plate emission shield, ‘right’. But, if we have N number
of emission shields having equal surface emissivity then we can write this to be equal to
you see for a single it was 2, 1 plus 1, ‘right’. So, then we can write for N number of that
this is 

, ‘right’.(Refer Slide Time: 21:53)
So, I hope it is understandable that this 2 came to be equal to this was for 1 shield. So,
that 1 shield can be written as 1 shield plus 1 if and there been 2 shields then it would
have been 2 shield plus 1. So, it would have been 3, if it would have been 3 shields then
it would have been 3 shield plus 1; that means, it would have been 4. Like that if we have
N number of shields then it is N + 1 and this of 2. 
So, it was (N+1) × (2/ɛ - 1) that is what is the Q N, ‘right’. So, we found out Q 1 or we
found out QN had there been same emissivity for all the surfaces equal to ɛ, ‘right’. 
(Refer Slide Time: 23:02)
Now, let us look into hence the ratio of heat transfer rates for parallel plate system
having N shields and no shield when all emissivitys are equal are like this Q N/Q is
nothing, but 1/(N +1), ‘right’. Why it is so?
(Refer Slide Time: 23:44)
Because, we saw that; we saw that here it was this factor; it was this factor which is
common in both the cases, ‘right’. It was this factor which was common for both the
cases, ‘right’. So, this goes out, cancels out when there is a ratio. So, Q N/Q1, ‘right’ this
was like this 1/(N +1), ‘right’. So, that is what exactly we have shown in the next page
that is QN/Q is 1/(N + 1), ‘right’. 
For two concentric sphere or long cylinders with for two concentric sphere or long
cylinders with opaque surfaces having A 1 and A2 surface areas, T1 and T2 temperatures,
ɛ1  and ɛ2 emissivity of the inner and outer surfaces respectively and assuming F 12 = 1, we
can write, for A1 = A2 = A we can write that 

Qo, ‘right’. (Refer Slide Time: 25:29)
So, for A1 = A2 = A, this equation reduces to the same for parallel plates, ‘right’. A 1 = A2
= A so, this becomes 1 and this becomes A. So, it was same as for parallel plate A × ΔA
× σ × (T14 - T24) /((1/σ1+ 1/σ2)-1), ‘right’. 
But, if it is we said two opaque surfaces having areas A 1 and A2 surface areas. So, areas
changed from A1 to A1 and A2 temperatures where T 1 and T2, fine, but emissivity also,
we have ɛ1 and ɛ2 only the areas we got changed. So, our Q that became equal to A 1σ (T14
– T24) / (1/ɛ1 + 1/A2) times (1 - ɛ2) -1, ‘right’. 
And in earlier also we had shown that if the limiting condition is valid then that means,
the expression is correct, ‘right’. Here what is the limiting condition? That we have
written on the red ink red line or red ink that for A 1 = A2 = A this relation should now be
equal to two parallel plates which we have done earlier, ‘right’. 
So, if that be true then it becomes A 1 is A and this A1/A2  since they are same so, that
becomes equal to 1. So, this expression e becomes the expression for the parallel plates,
‘right’. If a radiation shield is placed between the two surfaces and ɛ 3,1 and ɛ3,2 be the
emissivity  of  the  shield  at  the  surfaces  facing  the  inner  and  outer  surfaces  of  the
assembly respectively; then the situation will which will come up is quite different and
that we will find out, ‘right’. Hopefully, today whatever we have said we could have got it and since our time is now
limited so, we will stop it here. But, in the next class we will do that if there is a radiation
shield between them then what will be the Q and how it will be varying and maybe we
will do some problem, so that our understanding becomes more confident, ok.
So, thank you.
