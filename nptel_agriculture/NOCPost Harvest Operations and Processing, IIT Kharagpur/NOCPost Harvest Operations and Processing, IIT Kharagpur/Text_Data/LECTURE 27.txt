Concentrates and Pastes  
 
The topics covered in this lecture are the concentration process, methods of concentration such 
as evaporation, cryo concentration, membrane concentration, and lastly some common 
concentration paste like tomato paste fig paste and mango paste  with their manufacturing 
process .  
 
Concentration  
Juice concentration is aimed at removing water and increasing the sol uble solids (SS °Brix) 
content. Increasing SS concentration in juice offers advantages  in preservation of its quality, 
2 
 longer shelf life, storage  and shipping.  Juice concentration is mainly acc omplished to r educe 
water activity (a w) of the juice product which lengthens its shelf life, m inimize packagi ng, 
storage, and transport cost, and s tabilize or simplify the handling of the final juice product.  
 
Method of concentrations  
The concentration processes may be three types , such as  evaporation , membrane  concentration 
or cryogenic concentration or low temperature concentration . Evaporation is the removal of 
water by boiling . Whereas , in the me mbrane concentration, the juice is passed th rough a sem i 
permeable membrane and the membrane selectively retains certain components and solids  and 
allows the water to work , for example reverse osmosis and microfiltration are commonly used. 
In the cryo concentration , the freezing of water and then mechanical se paration of the ice 
crystals from the unfrozen  solution .  
 
Preparation of fruit juice concentrate  
3 
 It involves  receiving of fruits, sorting/washing, brush washing, final inspection, concentrate  of 
desired brix, concentration, juice extraction, aseptic processing, packaging, storage under 10 
ᵒC, ch illing at 5 -10 ᵒC, packaging in drums, blast freezing at -40 ᵒC, and frozen storage at -18 
ᵒC. 
 
Evaporation  
Evaporation is the process that separates water from the juices by means of heat energy. It may 
be executed in batch or continuous mode to produce desired pumpable concentrated liquids.  In 
single effect  evaporator,  heating medium is steam or water vapours and involves  inefficient use 
of thermal energy and for evaporating 1 kg of water about 1 kg per hour live steam is required.  
In multi -effect evaporator, h eating medium is vapors  from the previous stage/effect, and is 
more e fficient use of thermal energy. Evaporation of water from juice occurs at a lower 
temperature.  
 
Multi -effect evaporator  
4 
 In multi -effect evaporator (MEE), the single effect evaporators are connected in series. The 
vapours produced in first and second effects (or evaporation chambers) are used again as the 
heating medium in second and third effects, respectively.  In MEE, steam is used only in the 
first effect. The reuse of vapours results higher energy -use efficiency from the system. The 
partially concentrated product leaving the first effe ct is introduced as feed into the second effect 
and so on.  
Steam  economy = mv1̇+mv2̇+mv3̇
mḟ  
Where,  mv1̇, mv𝟐, ̇and  mv𝟑̇ are the vapours produced in 1st
 , 2nd
 , and 3rd
 effects, respectively 
(kg/h) and  mḟ is steam suppled (kg/h).  
 
 
Mass balance on flow streams  
mḟ=mv1̇+mv2̇+mv3̇+mṗ 
Mass balance on solid fractions  
xf mḟ=xp mv1̇ 
Where x f  & x p are the solid fraction in the feed stream at first effect and  the product stream 
from the third effect.  
Enthalpy balances around each effect  
mḟHf+mṡHvs=mv1̇Hv1+mf1̇Hf1+mṡHcs 
mf1̇Hf1+mv1̇Hv1=mv2̇Hv2+mf2̇Hf2+mv1̇Hc1 
mf2̇Hf2+mv2̇Hv2=mv3̇Hv3+mṗHp3+mv2̇Hc2 
Where, the subscripts 1, 2, 3, s and c refer to the first, second, and third effect, steam and 
condensate, respectively; H represent enthalpy of the stream (kJ/kg).  
5 
  
Hf= Cpf (Tf−Tref) 
Hp= Cpp (T3−Tref) 
Where, Cpf and Cpp are the specific heat content of feed and product (kJkg-1
°C-1
); Tf, T3, and 
Tref are the feed, product and reference temperature (°C) . 
 
Heat transfer across the heat exchanger  
q1= U1A1(Ts−T1) 
q2= U2A2(T1−T2) 
q3= U3A3(T2−T3) 
Where, q is heat transfer rate (W) ; U is overall heat transfer coefficient (Wm-2K-1); A is area of 
heat exchanger (m2); T is temperature (°C) ; Subscript 1, 2, 3 and s are the first, second, third 
effects and steam, respectively.  
Pressure and temperature  in each effect  
Pressu re (P) in each subsequent stage: P1 > P2 > P3 > …. > PN, Boiling temperature (T b) of 
water decreases as pressure decreases : T1 > T2 > T3 > … > TN, Where , P is pressure (Pa) .

Arrangement of effects in multiple effect evaporation  
In the co -current  type,  the steam  and feed both are  passing in the same direction . Similarly , in 
the parallel also  the almost similar arrangement is there, where in the counter  current there is 
the steam and feed is entering in the opposite direction .  
 
Pan or kettle evaporator  
They are simplest and oldest types of evaporators, which are used for the concentration of 
juices, sauces, jams, and confection products. It consists of a h emispherical shells (pans) made 
of SS.  Heating  may be  by steam circulating in c oils or by heating coils made of copper (high 
thermal conductivity).  Shell can be mounted permanently in vertical position for product exit 
at the bottom of the pan.  Heat conduction to the solution raises temperature of fruit juice 
causing evaporation of w ater. So, the advantages of this  is that easy installation , easy 
scalability , easy maintenance , and  smaller capital cost . However , it is not suitable for 
evaporation of thermally labile  heat products .  
7 
  
Vacuum pan evaporators  
Concentration of juices by boiling under vacuum is the only practicable method for the 
commercial producti on of fruit juice concentrates. Vacuum pan evaporators (VPEs) are similar 
to pan or kettle evaporators in all ways except that they are connected to high -power vacuum 
pumps.  VPEs are suitable for the concentration of fruit juice/pulp to prepare                                  
concentrate/paste. VPEs are composed of stainless steel pan, anchor - and paddle -like                                                                
stirring assemblie s, steam jacket, and condenser. VPEs operate at around 70 °C and are often 
capable of concentrating up to 200 kg of fruit juice per hour, with an average evaporation                                                                                        
rate of 3000 kg/h.  
 
Rising/falling film evaporators  
In these evaporators, thin films of juice are passed over rising or falling plates. This allows the 
evaporation process to occur more quickly at lower temperatures.  Due to conduction, 
temperat ure of juice rises, and f inally the water evaporates from the juice. These evaporators 
generally consist of a number of heat exchangers and lateral concentric centrifugal separators. 
8 
 These are mainly used where the juice cannot endure prolonged exposure ex posure at elevated 
temperature.  The juice is fed into the top of the heating tubes and this is distributed 
continuously into the thin film wh ile rising or fal ling the films that facilitates the quick 
evaporation of rising and falling films and there is separation  of falling  films in the separator 
at the bottom.  
 
Thermally accelerated short -time evaporator (TASTE)  
TASTE is a continuous HTST evaporator which comprises a long vertical tube of falling film. 
TASTE is also known as seven -effect evaporator as steam is reused 7 times to evaporate the 
water.  TASTEs operate on the principle of  high temperature, short -time exposure , thermally 
accelerated descending flow (longer falling film tubes) , and l ow steam consumption . This type 
of evaporator is most suitable  for orange juice concentration , other low -pulp or clear fruit 
juices , and p re-concentration of products containing higher fiber .  
 
Effects of evaporative concentration process on quality attributes  
9 
 Changes in the organoleptic quality or nutritional value  of the concentrate is reduced when 
volatile recovery is used. Without volatile recovery, losses of aroma compounds, including 
esters, aldehydes and terpenes, reduce the flavour of concentrated juices. It darkens the colour 
of foods, partly because of the increase in concentration of solids. The r eduction in water 
activity promotes chemical changes (e.g. Maillard browning) and  causes changes to 
anthocyanins and other pigments in fruit products.  Improperly selected concentration method 
may be detrimental to product’s sensory and nutritional profile, and increase production costs.  
Selection of con centration approach depends on n ature and state of juice and e xtent of 
concentration . 
 
Membrane technology  
Membrane technology is a non -thermal processing technology having advantages of lesser 
energy consumption, and lesser loss of nutritional profile especially thermolabile vitamins and 
phytonutrients.  One of the promising alternatives of membrane -based techn ology is reverse 
osmosis, but it cannot satisfy the concentrations normally higher than 25 -30 °Bx.  Recent 
developments in membrane engineer ing to overcome this limitation include  membrane 
distillation (MD), osmotic evaporation, and integrated membrane processes. The pressure is 
the driving force of membrane separation to separate the concentrate and water goes out with 
permeate.  
10 
  
Membrane distillation  
Membrane  distillation (MD) u ses a microporous hydrophobic membrane to separate two 
aqueous solutions maintained at different temperatures. A net flux of pure water occurs from 
solution at higher temperatu re to that at low temperature. The driving force is due t o difference 
in vapor pressure at solution -membrane i nterface. MD occurs at ordinary pressure and 
temperature (much lower t han conventional evaporation). It is used to concentrate juices 
sensitive to high temperature and high osmotic pressure.  The typical membrane characteristics 
may be 0.1 -0.2 µm in diamete r, 80-250 µm thick, and the porosity in the range of 0.6 -0.8. The 
membrane materials commonly used are p olytetrafluoroethylene , polyvinyl difluoride , 
polypropylene . The process includes f ormation of a vapor pressure gap at solution -membrane 
interface , passage of vapors through microporous membrane system , and c ondensation of 
vapor phase at the cold side of membrane.  
 
Direct osmosis concentration  
11 
 Direct osmosis concentration (DOC) operates at  low temperature and pressure. In DOC, the 
osmotic pressure gradient between fruit juice and solution of osmotic agent is maintained 
across a semipermeable membrane . Therefore, water flows from single -strength juice (low 
osmotic pressure) to a hygroscopic, nontoxic, inert osmotic agent (high o smotic pressure) that 
does not affect the taste, color, or odor of the juice product. Generally, the solids of smaller 
molecular weight, when present in higher concentrations, offer higher osmotic pressure. It is 
capable of retaining the original flav or and sensory characterist ics of fruit juices.  
 
Representation of DOC process  
The DOC process contains direct osmosis flat module, ball valve, peristaltic pump, feed 
reservoir, osmotic agent reservoir, and balance. The DOC membrane module is shown in this 
figure and its mechanism of direct osmosis. Basically, water transports from the solution of 
low osmotic pressure to the solution of high osmotic pressure . π1 and π 2 are osmotic pressures 
of feed and osmotic agent solution,  P1 and P2 indicate feed side and osmotic agent side 
hydraulic pressures.  
 
12 
 Reverse osmosis  
If pressure exerted on high -brix solution (juice) exceeds osmotic pressure, solvent (water) 
moves in opposite direction through the membrane. RO has been used for concentrating juices 
of pe ach, pear, apple, and mandarin. Soluble solids increased from 12.2 to 30.5 and 21.52 °Bx 
under 4 and 2 MPa transmembrane pressure.   
 
The theories involved for solute and water transport are preferential sorption theory (solute and 
solvent pass through the membrane by diffusion), and solution diffusion theory (solute and 
solvent are first absorbed at membrane surface before  passing through the membrane. Factors 
leading to reduced flux are a ccumulation of solute at membrane surface , increase in osmotic 
pressure , and c oncentration polarization impact . The possible solutions are a ltering operating 
conditions such as feed pressure, concentration , temperature, crossflow velocity, promoting 
turbulence , back flushing/w ashing , pulsed flow . 
 
Osmotic evaporation  
13 
 In osmotic evaporation/osmotic distillation, a hydrophobic microporous  membrane is used to 
detach two liquid phases that differ greatly in terms of solute concentration.  The microporous 
membranes work as physical supports at the vapor -liquid interface. The evaporation process 
accompanied by simultaneous heat and mass transfe r and the overall permeation rate is decided 
by membrane properties, operating cond itions (mass or heat transfer). In particular, this 
technique best fits the situation encountering thermally labile and volatile coloring and 
flavoring agents such as fruit juices.  
 
Cryo concentration (Freeze concentration)  
Cryo concentration is an effective way to concentrate biological materials w ithout harming 
their integrity. It involves removal of pure water in form of ice c rystals at subzero temperature. 
It is particul arly suitable for the concentration/separation of thermosensitive biological 
compounds.  The components of single -stage cryo -concentration unit are crystallizer, where ice 
crystallizes in scrapped surface heat exchangers (SSHE) and encapsulated with cooling  
coils/circulating refrigerants, and washing column, where c oncentrated liquid is separated 
efficiently from ice crystals.  
14 
  
The advantages are m aximum retention of original product characteristics , no or little effect on 
taste, aroma, color, or nutrients , and h igher concentration level achievable than reverse 
osmosis . The disadvantages includes l ower concentration level achievable than boiling under 
vacuum , very high capital costs, d ifficult control of ice crystal growth for a longer time 
(capacity constra int), large energy consumption (due to nonstop rotation of the scraping 
blades) , solids loss due to juice entrapped in ice crystals , and s ometimes phase changes can be 
detrimental to nutritional and sensory characteristics . 
 
Progressive freeze concentrati on (PFC)  
PFC is an exceptional modifi cation in conventional process. It avoids capacity con straint and 
nutritional losses. In PFC, SSHE are replaced with mor e efficient spiral exchangers.  In PFCs, 
crystals are deposited in the form of layers over on e anot her on the cooled surface of the larger 
surface area (spiral fin) which exceptionally reduces the capital costs and undesirable changes.   
15 
  
Pressure -shift nucleation cryo -concentration (PSN)  
In PSN, ice nucleation is avoided while cooling the liquid to subzero temperature at high 
pressure. A sudden pressure release would induce a uniform supercooled liquid that would 
crystalize thoroughly rather than on the surface of the liquid as happens during conventional 
freezing.  Problems with conventional freeze c oncentration process  are ice crystals formed at 
the cold surface of SSHE ’s are dendritic and too small, t heir efficient separation in the washing 
column is diffi cult, and t he ice crystals may have pockets and scoops which might be occupied 
by concentrated juice.  The advantages of PSN are that i t is easier to set temperature of a high -
pressure vessel than for a SSHE, t here is no need for complex scrapin g devices, thus energy is 
saved, c rystallization takes place in whole vessel; no need to recirculate juice to inc rease 
size/volume of ice formed, i ce crystals grown during expansion are round  and free of pockets 
and scoops, r etains and stabil izes thermolabile food products, and u se of high pressure can 
inactivate microbial or enzymatic loads.  
Tomato paste  
Accor ding to Codex Alimentarius, tomato paste must contain at least 24% tomato solids on a 
salt-free basis. Tomato paste is made by de -seeding and de -skinning the tomatoes and cooking/ 
concentrating them for several hours. The production of a paste can be perfo rmed with the 
following processes such as thermal evaporation, freeze concentration, membrane separation 
(Ultrafilteration or reversed osmosis), and application of thickening agents to improve the 
consistency of the product.  
16 
  
 
The process for preparation  of tomato paste includes selection of tomatoes, washing using 
potable water, s orting and trimming , blanching at 90 °C for 3 -5 min , pulping and straining, 
cooking to desired consistency (double jacketed steam kettle/vacuum pan), judging end -point 
TSS for p uree 12 -15%, or paste 25% (tomato solids by hand refractometer or volume by 
measuring stick), filling hot into bottles or cans at 82 -88 °C, sterilization in boiling water for 
20 min, cooling, and storage at ambient temperature (in cool and dry place).  
17 
  
Fig paste  
The process manufacture of fig paste consists of selection of fig fruit (mature with bright color 
and characteristic flavour), sorting (in which diseased, damaged or decayed fruits are rejected 
or trimmed), washing and cleaning (rinsed with chlorine dioxide solution, 10 -100 ppm), 
checking of aflatoxin under black UV lamp, detection of metal, grinding, pulping, addition of 
preservatives @ 0.05%, sugar @ double rate and soy protein isolate, colloidal milling, boiling 
with scraping (100  °C for 5-10 min, brix testing (70 °Brix), hot filling, and sealing.  
 
Mango paste (pulp)  
The process includes series of machineries such as receiving trough, bubble floating washing 
elevator, roller sorting machine, brush type washing machine, tunnel continuous pr e-cooking 
machine, peeling and nuclear machine, screw conveyor, beating refiner, buffer tank, 
homogenizer, degasser, tubular sterilizer, aseptic bag filling machine.

In summary, Juice concentration is an important processing technique to increas e shelf -life of 
juice products. A wide array of fruit juice concentration metho ds mainly based on evaporation, 
cryoconcentration, and membrane filtration techniques. Evaporation may be executed in 
batches or in a continuous manner to produce the desired  pumpable concentrated liquids. 
Freeze or cryoconcentration has been believed to be an effective way of concentrating the 
materials without harming their integrity.
