(Refer Slide Time: 0:25)  
 
 
Hello everyone, we are in the module 11 of the course. In this five lectures of 11th week, we 
will discuss various aspects of packaging and storage of horticultural and plantation crop  
product.  What is packaging technology.  
(Refer Slide Time: 0:37)  
 
In this, we will study the properties of packaging materials like mechanical, thermal, optical 
and barrier properties. And we will discuss about the self -life of packaged foods including  how 
to predict shelf -life in packaging, packaged foods.  
(Refer Slide Time: 1:00)  
 
We discussed the main function of a package are to contain the product and protect it against a 
range of hazards, which might adversely affect quality during handling, distribution, and 
storage. The package plays an important role in marketing and selling of the produce or the 
product. The various forms of packaging materials are used to prepare various shipping 
containers or retail containers.   
The shipping containers contain and protect the contents during transport and distribution.  But 
they have no fu nction in the marketing of the products like for example, sacks, corrugated fiber, 
metal cases, crates, barrels, drums, etc. On the other hand, retail containers  protect the food as 
well as advertise the food in convenient quantities for retail sale and  home storage. Examples 
of the retained containers include metal cans, glass or plastic bottles, jar, plastic tube, trays, etc . 
(Refer Slide Time: 2:22)  
 
 
The various types of packaging materials like wood, textile, metal, glass, even flexible films, 
plastic containers, paper, and board, etc are used for making different  types of either shipping 
containers or even the household retail containers.  The various  details of these containers as 
well as packaging materials used for these containers  and also the packaging methods and 
equipment,  we have elaborated in lecture 19 and 20. So, I request all of few to please refer to 
the lecture 19 and 20 for these details .  
(Refer Slide Time: 3:08)  
 
In this lecture today particularly,  we will discuss about the properties of the packaging 
materials . When you are keeping any food in a packet whether it is a fruit vegetable  or any such 
commodity , then  basically this packaging material performs certain functions like it offers 
protection,  containment,  convenience, as well as it helps in transporting , communicat ing like  
the labeling of the packet . It gives information about the food  which is packed inside.   
So, basically in the packaging, we create some sort of wall that is a packaging wall  between the 
food and the environment. And therefore,  this packaging material and packaging  wall performs 
various functions. Depending upon the in teractions among  the package , package material, food 
and the surrounding environment or environment inside the packet like for example, oxygen.   
Depending upon the permeability of the packaging material, the packaging wall may allow the 
oxygen to go out. And if oxygen goes out inside the packet, it may catalyze oxidation reaction 
color flavor as well as this oxygen is used for respiration. When the  food respires, fruits and 
vegetables respire, they release carbon dioxide. There may be carbonation loss and the carbon 
dioxide changes the environment inside and then it may be reduce the shelf -life. 
The packaging material should have good oxygen permeab ility, carbon dioxide permeability, 
water vapor permeability. When the food is dehydrated food  and put in the package, we want 
that it should not regain moisture or it should not lose moisture etc .  
Similarly, light transmission  food is  kept inside a packa ge. So, to protect them from the light, 
the packaging walls will provide different protection. A component migration  might be 
happened from the packaging material into the food products.  So, there are  various interactions 
between the food, package and the environment.  
(Refer Slide Time: 6:41)  
 
 
So, as per the requirement, we try to control the interactions.  Sometimes, the beneficial 
interaction you want to encourage and the undesirable interactions want  to discourage and want 
to stop and accordingly the packaging type and  properties of packaging material play very 
important role in this direction.  
Packaging material should have a proper property like, mechanical property which describes  
the behavior of material to mechanical f orces like mechanical strength, density, elongation, etc. 
Thermal properties describe  behavior of material to heat  like thermal conductivity, specific heat , 
etc. Optical properties describe  behavior of material to electromagnetic radiation such as 
refracti ve index, transparency  and glass. Barrier  property describes  behavior materials of glass  
like solubility, permeability , etc.  
(Refer Slide Time: 7:50)  
 
 
These properties play very important role and one has to choose a packaging material of 
desirable property, depending upon what results is required, what type of the food material or 
fruits or vegetable is being packaged. So, in the mechanical property, fi rst important property 
is tensile strength,  
Pattern of stress strain curve for thermoplastic is shown here in this figure. This tensile strength 
indicates the maximum stress that a material is able to sustain before failure, for plastic films it 
is the ultimate stress.   
Percent elongation at a brea k is calculated by reading the extension at the point of specimen  
𝐸𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (%)= 𝐿
𝐿𝑜×100 
Where elongation percent is equal to L/L0 multiplied by 100. And you can see here in this  figure 
different points are shown . 
(Refer Slide Time: 9:08)  
 
 
Then , modulus of elasticity or Young's modulus, it is calculated by extending the initial linear 
proportion  of the load extension curve by dividing the difference in the stress corresponding to 
any segment of the section. Stres s is force  divided  by area  and strain is the elongation in length 
divided  by original length.  Young modulus is the  stress by strain.  
𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠 = 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒
𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎= 𝐹
𝐴 
𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 = 𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑖𝑛 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡 ℎ (∆𝐿)
𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡 ℎ (𝐿𝑜)= 𝐹
𝐴 
𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔𝑠  𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠 = 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠
𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 
So, high Young’s  modulus means high stiffness of the material.   
(Refer Slide Time: 10:02)  
 
 
Then yield point, the stress at which the elastic material undergoes  increasing force and ceases 
to behave elasticall y. Break point is the point when  the stress at the point where the elastic 
specimen is ruptured . And impact strength is  the measurement of force that is required to re sist 
the penetration power of a rounded probe by a condition ed test pra ctice . This property is 
generally considered as “toughness ”. Impact strength  could be obtained by calculating the given 
area of the stress -strain curve before the  specimen is broken or stretched you can see that it is 
the break point here. There is the yie ld point here in this graph, that is, so the elastic region.  
(Refer Slide Time: 11:07)  
 
 
Tear strength, this property is considered as the “tear resistance” that is the force required to  
start tearing  flexible plastic films. One side , with a movable grip, holds the plastic  sample and  
stretches it at a constant rate of speed using a constant rate of grip separation  test from a fixed 
grip. Coefficient of friction , this property is determined by the  surface adhesivity that is surface 
tension and crystall inity are additives which are may  be slip pigment and anti -block agents and 
surface finish. The coefficient of friction is based on  the relative motion between two bodies in 
contact  and the coefficient  (µ) that can be expressed  
𝐹𝑟= 𝜇𝑁  
where N is the normal force , Fr is the frictional  force , µ is the static or kinetic frictional 
coefficient.  
(Refer Slide Time: 12:28)  
 
 
Shock testing, foods in plastic containers encounter multiple forms of shock during the physical 
distribution (rail cart switching, forklift handling, containerization, and manual handling).  
Barriers are depending  upon the type of the packet siz e and  packet type of the foods . So, this 
testing  is done to evaluate the protective functions of the packaging system and to see the  
fragility of the food. The result of the product fragility test is the damage boundary curve, which 
provides information to the package  designer about the regions where the product is more likely  
will be  damaged. You can  see here, in this region there wil l be no damage region, this is the 
critical acceleration  if you give a critical velocity.  Various forms of cushioning material  need 
to be utilized to prevent damage from occurring.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:45)  
 
 
Vibration testing,  vibration occurs during transportation whether it is air  transportation, 
maritime transposition, or on the road transportation, et c. These vibrations are highly dependent 
on the speed  suspensions , type of vehicle , and road characteristics or weather conditions  in case 
of maritime shipping etc . In general , maritime transport produces, the lower  frequency  
vibration s, followed by over the road transport, rail transport, and air transport.   
So, the types of vibrations may be repeated to shock vibration, it is the ide al for evaluating the  
shock resistance of packaging solutions . Due to their fixed frequency and fixed amplitude , 
limited in their ability to simulate the real word competitive vibrations. The variable frequency 
vibration testing is much better at simulating the complete nature of the physical  distribution, it 
has the ability to control amplitude , frequency and accele ration.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:06)  
 
Then, let us discuss the thermal properties of the packaging materials and in this , thermal 
conductivity  and specific heat are two important properties. Thermal conductivity is a rate of  
heat transfer per unit area of unit thickness per unit temperature difference .  
𝑄=𝐾𝐴∆𝑇
𝑥 
Q is equal to K  A delta T by x where K is the thermal conductivity , A is the area of cross section , 
x is thickness of  the material and delta  T is the temperature difference, Q is the heat transfer 
rate. Q is equal to m  Cp delta  T, Cp is the specific heat of the material, Q is the heat required, 
and delta T is the temperature difference.  
𝑄=𝑚𝐶𝑝∆𝑇 
So, a specific heat measures the amount of heat necessary to produce a unit change of 
temperature in a material.  
So, in this table , the specific heat and thermal conductivity of different packaging materials are  
given like stainless steel. You can see,  it has the highest higher thermal conductivity K value . 
So, it has a lower spec ific heat. So, wood which has a higher specific heat like 2.72, it has a 
lower  thermal conductivity. Aluminum you see it has the maximum thermal  conductivity and 
it has a lowest specific heat.  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:40)  
 
 
Then , thermal expansion, there is  coefficient of linear expansion , alpha , and volume expansion , 
beta, express the relative change in length or volume , respectively , for a temperature change at 
a constant pressure.  
𝐿=𝐿𝑜(1+ 𝛼∆𝑇) 
𝑉=𝑉𝑜(1+ 𝛽∆𝑇) 
where L and V are the length and value  after temperature change and L 0 and V 0 are the length 
and value before temperature change and delta T is the  temperature change.  
Tolerable thermal range,  the lowest limit of range is the temperature at which material shows 
the maximum fragility affordable during the commercial distribution.  The highest  temperature 
is one that begins to cause a physical distortion of the object , a lack of performance  or the  
beginning of the chemical change. The temperature is another important property  which is 
required, which should be  considered while selecting a packaging material. For example , you 
see the stainless steel its alpha that is the linear expansion is 13 multi ply 10 to the power 6 mm 
whereas the temperature  range , the lowest range is  minus 45 to about 600 degrees . 
This HDPE , it has alpha 120 and the lowest temperature is minus 90 and high est temperature is 
60 to 80 degree and these temperatures are generally in  degree Celsius.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:34)  
 
Transition temperatures are the temperature at which change in  the state of the substance occur 
under standard procedure. The graph of  stiffness versus temperature graph. And this side it 
shows that amorphous progressive softening or crystalline sharp melting point. So, in transition 
temperature , there are two : melting temperature (Tm) and the glass transition temperature (Tg). 
So, the melting temperature is the temperature  correspond to the phase change  from solid to 
liquid state. Crystalline substances,  have a sharp melting point,  while the amorphous or non -
crystalline materials have no  melting point, but th ey soften with the heating . 
Glass transition temperature is the temperature at which is substantial change in the molecular 
chain mobility takes place. Plastic polymers manufacture to attend T g above and below  room 
temperatures . Tg below room temperature, rubbery state , material is flexible and soft.  
Tg above room temperature , glassy state and it will be a  rigid material.  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:14)  
 
Then, we will discuss optical properties, the refraction index is an important optical property 
and it is according to the law of refractions or Snell’s  law. A monochromatic  light passes 
through a medium m 1 to another medium m 2 of higher density.  The angle of incidence (Φi) and 
the angle of refraction (Φr) are different with the  latter , that is the angle of refraction being  lower 
because the velocity of light ( v1) in m 1 decreases in m 2 (v2).   
So, the n that is the refractive index is equal to sin  Φi by sin Φ r and is equal to v 1 by v 2. 
𝑛= sin∅𝑖
sin∅𝑟=𝑣1
𝑣2 
 So, this property is generally used for a n objective characterization of clearness of the glass 
and transparent  plastics.  
(Refer Slide Time: 21:34)  
 
Transparency, the fraction of light transmitted by a packaging material is found using  the Beer -
Lambert law that is I t. Here you see that there is a transparent material and the incident  radiation 
is going I 0 intensity from the standard the light source, when it falls that light is light transmitted 
I.  
𝐼𝑡=𝐼𝑜𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝛼𝑥) 
 where, I t is the intensity of  light transmitted by packaging and x is the thickness of the 
packaging material and alpha is the characteristic  absorbance of the packaging material.   
So, light transmission is required in packages that are intended to display the containers.  Many 
a times we want that inside the material whatever is packed in which form , it should  be visible 
to the consumer. So, in such cases , it should  be restricted  when the food are susceptible to 
deterioration by light.   
For example, rancidity  caused by  oxidation of lipid , loss of nutritional value due to destruction 
of riboflavin , or changes in the  color caused by loss of nat ural pigments etc . So, these are light 
catalyzed reaction. So, accordingly  the material which are susceptible to these reactions they 
should be packed in opaque  or non -transparent containers or packaging material.  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:19)  
 
So, transmission factor that is the percent T is calculated as,  
%𝑇= 𝐼𝑡
𝐼𝑜×100 
that is the amount of light absorbed by the food  
𝐼𝑎=𝐼𝑜𝑇1−𝑅𝑓
1−𝑅𝑓𝑅𝑝 
where R f is the fraction reflected  by the food and R p is the fraction reflected by the packaging 
material you can see here  is the figure I 0 is falling and then I is going.  
(Refer Slide Time: 23:59)  
 
Then haze is another important property, optical property, it is a degree of opacity measured in 
the percentage of transmitted light, which deviates more than 2.5 degree from incident radiation  
by forward scattering in passing through a specimen.  
%𝐻𝑎𝑧𝑒 = 𝐼𝑠
𝐼𝑇×100 
where I s is the intensity of the scattered light with the trap light, whereas the  It is the intensity 
of the total light transmitted.  
Gloss is the attribute of  surface which means the shiny appearance of packaging material, it is 
the ratio of the luminous flux reflected from the material at a specified solid angle to the 
luminous  flux incident at the same solid.   
(Refer Slide Time: 25:05)  
 
The barrier properties of the packaging materials have significant influence on the shelf -life, 
safety and quality of the  packaged food  properties. Water vapor , gas, and  light barrier 
properties, these are the primary consideration w hen designing a packaging material for a 
specific end use. So, this barrier properties particularly in fruits and vegetable packaging they 
are much  importan t.  
So, the permeation mechanism which is a three -step process, that is the permeate molecule from  
the contracting liquid phase at a partial pressure P 1, penetrates through the polymer surface . For 
pressure below one atmosphere , the value of the permeate conce ntration at the polymer  interface 
follows Henry’s Law. The permanent diffuses within the polymer from higher to lower 
concentration as per the Fick’s Law. And the permeant  leaves the opposite polymer interface to 
diffuse in the adjacent continuous phase ei ther liquid  phase or gas phase at a pressure P 2 that is 
outside . Here is the C 1 and here is the C 2. C the concentration, P is the partial pressure and X is 
the thickness of the film.  
(Refer Slide Time: 26:44)  
 
Then solubility according to the Fick’s Law ,  
𝑁𝐴=𝐷𝐴𝐵𝐶1−𝐶2
𝑥 
where N A is the flux of the gas and D AB is the diffusivity of A through B. The value of c can be 
correlated to partial pressure using Henry's Law of equilibration that is  
𝑐= 𝑆𝑝
22.414 
𝑐1= 𝑆𝑝1
22.414 
𝑐2= 𝑆𝑝2
22.414 
. S is the solubility coefficient and P is the partial pressure of the gas.   
Permeability P is a gas diffusing that is a per cubic meter per second per square meter , cross 
sectional  area A through  1 meter thick (x) solid under pressure difference of delt a P of 1  
atmosphere pressure . And it is given  
𝑃= 𝑞𝑥
𝐴∆𝑝 
So, the relationship between the P that is permeability and DAB that is the divisibility of A 
through B and the solubility coefficient S is  
𝑃=𝐷𝐴𝐵𝑆 
 
(Refer Slide Time: 28:16)  
 
Gas transmission rate, the barrier of the film to different gases O 2 and CO 2 is expressed as per  
permeability coefficient which expresses as amount of particular gas permeate per unit area  and 
the time through the unit  thickness under the pressure difference . So, the permeability  
coefficien t, P O2 for oxygen and P CO2 for carbon dioxide, similarly transmission rate is written 
as OTR for oxygen transmission and CO 2TR for the carbon dioxide .  
𝑃𝑂2= 𝑂𝑇𝑅  𝑥
∆𝑝 
𝑃𝐶𝑂2= 𝐶𝑂 2𝑇𝑅 𝑥
∆𝑝 
Similarly, OTR and CO 2TR can be calculated, if you know the PO2 and partial pressure 
difference  and th e thickness of the material.  
𝑂𝑇𝑅 = 𝑃𝑂2∆𝑝
𝑥 
𝐶𝑂 2𝑇𝑅= 𝑃𝐶𝑂2∆𝑝
𝑥 
And these data the gas transmission rate data, they play very important role in selecting the type 
of the packaging  material as well as the deciding the amount of the absorbent or emitters etc, 
which are required to be kept inside the package in the smart packaging system or active  
packaging system . 
(Refer Slide Time: 29:37)  
 
And water  vapor transmission rate that is WVTR, the water vapor barriers of a film is expressed  
as the water vapor permeability coefficient , which  indicates the amount of water vapor  that 
permeates per unit area and time through unit thickness under pressure differ ence,  
 
𝑃𝐻2𝑂= 𝑊𝑉𝑇𝑅  𝑥
∆𝑝 
𝑊𝑉𝑇𝑅 = 𝑃𝐻2𝑂 ∆𝑝
𝑥 
So, WVTR is generally expressed in either cc or ml or gram per square meter per second.  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:19)  
 
So, there are various factors which influence the permeability of a packaging material like the  
chemical structure of the polymer and the perme ant, determines the particular level  of 
interaction. Polymer morphology that is increase in the polymer crystallinity, there is  
density, orientation or cross linking decrease the decrease permeability.  Humidity increases or 
decreases the permeability especially in hydrophilic polymers. Oxygen permeability  increases 
with the increase in relative humidity for ethylene EVOH are Nylon 6.   
However, oxygen permeability decreases in amorphous Nyl on. An increase in the  temperature 
increases the permeability. Fillers  generally decreases the permeability however, the  effect is 
complicated by the type, shape, amount of filler, and the interaction with the permeant .   
(Refer Slide Time: 31:22)  
 
So, these here the effect of temperature on permeability and is expressed by  
𝑃=𝑃𝑜𝑒𝑥𝑝−𝐸𝑎
𝑅𝑇 
Diffusion through a multi -layer packaging material is described by  
𝑁𝐴=𝑝1−𝑝2
22.414 [𝑥1
𝑃𝑥1+𝑥2
𝑃𝑥2+𝑥3

Permeability of a multi layered packaging material that

where X represent the thickness and T is the permeability  of the packaging material.  
(Refer Slide Time: 32:12)   
 
The shelf -life of packaged food is controlled by the intrinsic property of the food. Extrinsic 
environment factor is contamination by microorganism insect or soil. Mechanical forces like 
damage caused by the impact  vibration, compression . Pilferage , temper ing or adulteration are 
the various barrier properties  of the packaging field.  Packaging  isolates  the food to a 
predetermined degree from the environment as I discussed earlier also. So, the package provides 
total protection  against all sources of  deterior ation, f or example, sterilize d canned food , which  
have a shelf -life of even several years at ambient conditions . A permeable pack is required to 
enable exchange of respiratory gases in respiring fresh  fruits or a simple paper bag to keep short 
shelf -life products free from dust and insects.  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:24)  
 
For moisture sensitive products, the moisture content of the product varies with the relative 
humidity at which it is in equilibrium and vice versa. The relationship between the product  of 
moisture content and the relativity of the headspace is given by the products sorption  isotherms. 
Assuming that the relative humidity outside the package (RH of storage condition s, po) is 
constant, where the p change through the shelf -life period is a function of the product moisture 
content .  
𝑝=𝑝𝑜−𝑝𝑖(𝑀) 
where M is the  product moisture content on a dry basis and it is assumed that the RH of the 
storage  environment is constant.  
A differential quantity that is the d q of water exchanged through the package is equal to the 
differential  moisture content times the dry weight of the product W.  
𝑑𝑞=𝑊𝑑𝑀  
(Refer Slide Time: 34:34)  
 
For moisture -sensitive foods, the shelf -life can be written as  
𝑡= 𝑥𝑊
𝐴𝑃∫𝑑𝑀
𝑝𝑜−𝑝𝑖(𝑀)𝑀2
𝑀1 
refer to the products initial and final moisture content respectively. This equation estimates the 
value of the product ’s shelf -life, which is defined as the time during which a packaged moisture -
sensitive product remains in an acceptable  or saleable condition  under a specific condition of 
storage .  
The validity of the above equation is subject but not limiting to the following condition such  as 
there is a fast equilibrium between the product and the package of internal conditions. The delay 
in re aching steady state condition of permeability through the package material is neglected . 
The temperature and external humidity are constant through the shelf -life period. P is not 
affected by any permeant.   
So, similarly like other models , this model is based upon the moisture content. Similarly, other 
similar models can be forme d, they can be design or worked out or on the base of other suitable 
characteristics , the shelf -life can be predicted.

The driving forces for innovation in food packaging are the consumer lifestyle, consumer 
demand for products of convenience, taste good, sale, wholesome, and nutritious, which create 
need and opportunity for innovation in the food packaging. Then, value, h igher benefits may 
also be achieved by enhancing functions of the packaging, which satisfies the unmet needs of 
the consumers. The good packaging may also help the manufacturer or producer to earn more 
profit.  
Innovative food packaging can effectively pro tect against microbial contamination and product 
tempering . Stringent regulation  drives research and development related to  food packaging 
safety issues such as, migration of unwanted compounds from packag e to the food and recycling 
of packaging materials . 
(Refer Slide Time: 37:14)  
 
So, finally I will conclude this lecture, I will summarize that packaging is a very important 
concept particularly for fruits, vegetables, spices. The fruits and vegetables th at are highly  
respiring material and even they respire inside  the packaging. In the next lectures, 2 -3 lectures, 
we will discuss in detail about the respiratory behavior. How various active packaging , smart 
packaging can be done to use the shelf -life extension.   
So, but for all these points the selection of the appropriate packaging material, appropriate the 
packaging  that the material characteristics property that is how is the mechanical strength, when 
this packet is being transported, it is loaded, unloaded, ho w it will be at the packet should  not 
tear during the transportation is important. How, it will absorb the shock? How, it will permit  a 
transmit, the flow of gases from inside to outside, outside to inside and then light, all these 
influence the shelf -life as well as not the product inside the packet and value . So, this would be 
properly (collec ted) designed . Taking into consideration of the food characteristics, the intended 
shelf -life and the packaging material properties.

lecture . Finally, thank you very much for your hearing.
