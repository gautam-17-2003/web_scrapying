(Refer Slide Time: 0:21) 
 
Welcome friends to this  last lecture of week 8 of NP TEL online certification course of soil 
fertility and fertilizers. In this week, we are talking about different types of manures  and also 
we are talking about fertili zers, classification of fertilizers, important terms related to 
fertilizers and also their manufacturing processes specifically the chemical fertilizers we have 
already seen different types of organic manure like bulky organic manure or concentrated 
organi c manure we have seen in details about farm  yard manure, compost methods of 
preparation of compost like Indore  method, Bangalore method NADEP method , Coimbatore 
method we have discussed .  
We have also discussed how to preserve the quality of farm  yard manu re and then, we have 
also discussed about different types of fertilizer that means classification of chemical 
fertilizers, what are the state fertilizer, what are the complex fertilizer what are the mixed 
fertilizers we have discussed also we have discusse d some important terms like conditioner 
feeler fertilizer grade fertilizer ratio. So, also if you remember in our last lecture, we have 
discussed the manufacturing process of several important fertilizers like urea and then 
Muriate potash and then single s uper phosphate and so on.  So, in today's lecture, we are going to discuss about the m icronutrient fertilizer because  so, 
far we have discussed about macronutrient fertilizer today we are going to discuss about 
micronutrient fertilizers  and we are going to  recap those micronutrient fertilizers, which we 
have already discussed in our previous lectures. Apart from that we are going to see how to 
calculate the fertilizer requirement for a particular growing condition, what are the 
consideration and how we gene rally calculate the fertilizer requirement for a crop using 
several formulas we are going to discuss those things also.  
(Refer Slide Time: 3:04)  
 
 
So, as I said that, these are the 2 major concepts which we are going to cover in this lecture. 
First of all micron utrient fertilizers and then fertilizer calculations. So, these are the keywords for this lecture EDTA , fertilizer calculation , chelates , Borax,  soluble, so, we are going to 
discuss all of this.  
(Refer Slide Time: 3:27)  
 
Now, if we consider th e micronutrient fertilizers, one of the major plant micronutrient is zinc. 
Now, zinc fertilizers are both in organic in nature as well as organic in nature . Organic 
compounds such related compounds so, you can see here in this table. zinc sulfate 
heptahydra te is a common zinc fertilizer, which contains 21 to 23  percent  of zinc, which is 
soluble zinc sulfate monohydrate contained 33 to 36  percent  of zinc, which is also soluble 
and then zinc carbonate and zinc oxide  both of them are an insoluble well zinc carb onate 
content 52 to 56  percent  of zinc and zinc oxide content 50 to 80  percent  of zinc, zinc chloride 
is soluble content 47 to 50  percent  of zinc, zinc frits, which are fritted glass, they contain 10 
to 30  percent  of zinc and they are slightly soluble amon g the organic compound or chelate 
compound we can see zinc EDTA zinc HEDTA and zinc NTA.  
So, zinc EDTA contains 12 to 14  percent  of zinc, zinc HEDTA contained 9  percent  of zinc 
and zinc NTA content 13  percent  of zinc. So, all of these chelate products are  soluble in 
nature water soluble in nature. So, among these zincs among these fertilizer, we can see zinc 
sulfate is widely used as it is widely available cheaper and highly soluble. And remember that 
chelated zinc fertilizers are costly then inorganic zin c, so we can see that zinc we can apply 
both inorganic as well as in chelate form.   (Refer Slide Time: 5:33)  
 
Now, let us see the copper fertilizers. Now, copper sulfate that is C uSO4  5H2O,  it is also 
known as blue vitriol. So, it is blue crystalline hy groscopic and soluble in water it contains 24  
percent  of copper and 12.8  percent  of sulfur and it can be applied as foliar spray or 
application it is generally widely used.  
Now, the second fertilizer is chelated copper fertilizer or copper EDTA we know th e full 
name of EDTA that is ethylene  diamine  tetra acetic acid, this chelated copper, copper EDTA 
content 13  percent  of copper and copper HEDTA and full name of HEDTA hydroxy 
ethylethylene di amine tri acetic acid it contained 9  percent  of copper and both are soluble in 
water that is copper EDTA and copper HEDTA both are soluble in water and can be used as 
foliar spray or soil application.  
So, they can be used both as foliar spray or soil application. The third important fertilizer is 
copper fertilizers , copper nitrate is a chemical formula and it is readily soluble in water and 
contains 26  percent  of copper. Fourth  one is copper ammonium phosphate which contains 32  
percent  copper and it is slightly soluble in water. The fifth one is copper oxide it is blac k and 
insoluble in water and it contains 75  percent  of copper. So, these are the major copper 
fertilizers, which we generally use in the crop.  (Refer Slide Time: 7:38)  
 
Now, third important micronutrient is iron and soils in which we can see iron defic iency or 
alkaline soil because  iron is mainly available in acidic condition. So, in alkaline condition we 
can see the deficiency of iron and also in case of calcaneus soil in arid or semiarid region we 
can see the iron deficiency also we can see th e iron  deficiency in poorly drained soil high in 
carbon dioxide and fine also in case of strongly acid soil very low in total iron we can also 
see iron deficiency.  
Now, there are several iron fertilizers both inorganic iron fertilizer and iron chelates among 
the inorganic iron fertilizer we can see ferrous sulfate heptahydrate or FeSO4 7H2O, which 
content 19 percent  iron then ferric sulfate the formula is Fe 2 So4 whole 3 4H2O which 
content 23  percent  of iron. The third one is ferrous oxide, which is FeO and conten t 77 
percent  of iron ferric oxide contained Fe2O3â€¦  it has a chemical formula of Fe2O3 and it 
contains 69  percent  of iron.  
Then ferrous ammonium sulfate which is FeSO4 NH4 whole 2SO4  6H2O, it contains 14  
percent  of Ir on, then Iro n frits which contain 20 to  40 percent  of iron. Among different 
organic iron fertilizer we can see Iron chelates  like sodium Iron EDTA which contain 5 to 14  
percent  of Iron, then sodium Iron DTPA, which contains 10  percent  of Iron, and then also 
sodium, Iron HEDTA  which content 5 to 9 percent  of Iron. So, you can see that Iron can be , 
we can apply iron both as inorganic iron fertilizer as well as organic chelates .  (Refer Slide Time: 9:59)  
 
Now, if we see the manganese fertilizers , manganese fertilizers are also divided in inorgan ic 
manganese fertilizers, and synthetic manganese chelates. Now, among inorganic manganese 
fertilizers we can see manganese sulfate, which has the chemical formula of MnSO4  4H2O 
which contains 26 to 28  percent  of manganese. Then manganese oxide which has t he 
chemical formula of MnO which content 41 to 68  percent  of manganese.  
Then manganese dioxide, which has the chemical formula of MnO 2 which contains 63  
percent  of manganese, manganese chloride M nCl2 content 17  percent  of manganese and then 
manganese glass frits content in 10 to 35  percent  of manganese . Among synthetic manganese 
chelates, we can see manganese EDTA, which content 5 to 12  percent  of manganese and 
manganese DTPA content 5 to 12  percent  of manganese also. So, you can see just like iron, 
we can  also see this like iron zinc we also see the both inorganic manganese fertilizer as well 
as synthetic chelates.  (Refer Slide Time: 11:21 )  
 
 
Now, the use of manganese sulfate is most common among all the manganese fertilizers and 
after this Manganese Sulfate we can see the user manganese oxide, it is MnO that is,  you can 
see here MnO which contain 41 to 68  percent  of manganese. So, this is slightly soluble in 
water and it must be finely ground to increase its effectiveness. Now, remember that to 
correc t the manganese deficiency , manganese fertilizer are applied generally by 3 methods 
one is soil application second is foliar spray and third is  injection into 3 tanks.  
Now, so for soil having pH about 6.5 band placement of manganese fertilizer is more 
effective than broadcast because if you apply manganese in broadcast it will become 
unavailable in alkaline condition. Now, usually brand rates are one half of the broadcast rate. 
So, in that way you can save the amount of fertilizer also and you can judiciou sly apply the  manganese fertilizer, bending manganese fertilizer mixed with an  acidic fertilizer  such as 
ammonium sulfate is more effective in correcting the manganese deficiency because 
manganese is mainly available in acidic condition. Now, you also need  to know that foliar 
application manure  chillers is more effective than soil application.  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:15)  
 
Now, let us discuss about boron fertilizers we have already discussed I am just make  I am just 
recapitulating all these so, Borax is the  major boron fertilizer which is having the formula of 
NA2 B4 O7 10H2O  it is white and soluble in water and it content generally 10.5  percent  of 
boron and it is widely used mostly  it is most widely use boron fertilizer then comes the 
soluble which is highl y water soluble it contains minimum 19  percent  of boron it is used for 
both soil and foliar application .  
Third is Colemanite and it is less soluble than borax. It is suitable for coarse textured soils 
which are subjected to leaching loss and it generally contain 10 to 16  percent  of Boron. Forth  
one is boric acid which contains 17  percent  of boron and its use  is generally limited. Fifth one 
is borosilicate glass or boron fates. Generally,  Borax is fused with silicate g lass and then 
shattered so that i s frits is suitable for application and long duration crop and this bo ron frits  
generally content 3 to 6 percent  of boron and finally boronated single super phosphate which 
contain 0.18  percent  of boron.  
Now , if we consider the management of boron deficient s oil, remember that soil application 
of borax at 10 to 12 kg per hectare, we generally recommend . Now, in case of acid soil the 
rate is usually lower that is 10 kg per hectare for neutral to alkaline soil the rate is generally higher that is 20 kg per hectare . Generally,  for foliar spray we recommend 0.25 to 0.5  percent  
of borax solution.  
(Refer Slide Time: 15:15 )  
 
If we consider the molybdenum fertilizers, there are 4 molybdenum fertilizers majorly 
available ammonium  molybdat e, sodium molybdate, molybdenum  glass frits and calcium 
molybdate . Well, ammonium molybdate and sodium molybdate are soluble in nature, we can 
see molybdenum glass frits are less soluble and calcium molybdate is insoluble in nature a nd 
all these we can see that ammonium molybdate contai n highest amount of molybdenum that 
is 52 to 54  percent .  
Now, if we see the rate of application of molybdenum, generally the soil application of 
ammonium molybdate or sodium molybdate is recommended at one kg per hectare or 15 kg 
to 15 kg per hectare. So,  the range is 1 to 15 kg per hectare. So, you can see the requirement 
is very low. So, molybdenum is also called Ultra micronutrient on Nano nutrients sometime. 
Now, in case of foliar application the applied concentration of the aqueous solution of the 
molybdate salt ranges between 0.05 to 0.37  percent . In case of seed treatment, so, we 
generally before seeding the seeds are thoroughly mixed with molybdate fertilizer and rate 
vary depending on the seed size.  (Refer Slide Time: 16:34 )  
 
Now, we already kn ow about Ch elates and we know the examples of Chelates also, so 
chelated  micronutrient are widely available for plant nutrition. And the process of chelation 
involves enveloping metal nutrients with the chelating agents for example, EDTA forming an 
organom etallic complex and the resulting chelates are highly cost effective required in 
extremely low doses and chemically inert making them environmentally safe.  
So, the EDTA Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid surrounds the inorganic iron and forms a 
weak bond with it. So effectively providing the new chain and organic coating chelates are 
useful for micronutrients applied to alkaline soils and chelated nutrients are also helpful for 
foliar application. So, here you can see that in organic nutrient generally can not easily 
penetrate the waxy leaf because there is a waxy layer over the leaf but chelated nutrients 
easily penetrate into the leaf and after that the ligand is removed from the metal. So, this 
chelate released this nutrient to inside the plant cell. So, this is how chelate works.  (Refer Slide Time: 18:03)  
 
Now, the bond between this organic chemical  and the inorganic nutrient  must be strong as 
well as weak to release the plant release in within the plant system. Now , EDTA is the most 
common synthetic circulating agent and is used for both soil and foliar applied nutrients 
DTPA on the other hand, is used mainly for chelates applied to alkaline soil and  it is more 
effective than EDTA but it is usually more expensive than EDTA. So, that is why you can see  
this is why we can select a particular chelating compound and  after comparing their cost, 
because cost involvement is one of the major factor when we consider the chelated fertilizers.  
(Refer Slide Time: 18:58 ) 
 
Now, if we see that, there are several fo rtified fertilizers, which contain micronutrient I have 
given here the list of list here which are notified under the fertilizer control order s chedule 1A so, you can see here Bor onated single superphosphate , zincated urea,  zincated phosphate in 
the form o f suspension then zinc ated NPK which content that is 12 percent nitro gen 32 
percent  P2O5 16 percent  K2O and 0.5  percent  of zin c, then zinc ated NPK that is 10  26 26 
0.5.  
So, 10 percent  nitrogen 26  percent  P2O5 , 26 percent  K2O  and 0.5  percent  of zinc then 
Boronat ed DAP  in case of DAP it contained 18  percent  nitrogen 46  percent  P2O5 and 0  
percent  K2O and Bor onated DAP generally contents along with these generally contain 0.3  
percent  of boron, boron ated NPK 10  26 26 0.3, then calcium nitrate with boron and the n you 
can see 15 15  15 0.2 for Boron DA P 0.5 zinc, and then SSP 0.5 zinc. So, these are different 
fortified fertilizers, which contained along with the primary nutrients, they also contain the 
secondary nutrients. So, this is why we call them fortif ied fertilizers.  
(Refer Slide Time: 20:47 )  
 
Now, as I have mentioned previously, the application of judicious fertilizer for higher yield 
generally depends on fertilizer application however, fertilizer application depends on both 
temporal variability then clim atic parameters and indigenous nitrogen or nutrient supply we 
can see here nutrient supply from manure  crop residues irrigation water and soil. So, this for 
nitrogen and we can see the same for the nutrients also.  (Refer Slide Time: 21:24 )  
 
So, guys we  have completed discussing about the macronutrient and micronutrient fertilizers. 
Now, let us discuss about how to calculate the fertilizers. Now, for that you need to 
remember some useful chemical conversion factors like when you multiply P with a factor of 
2.29 you get the you get the P 2O5, and when you multiply P 2O5 with 0.43 you get p when  
you multiply K with 1.20 you get K2O and when you multiply K2O  with 0.83 you get K 
similarly, you can see KCL to K K2SO4 to K conversions are given. Now, also you can  see 
here, these are some fertilizer nutrient ratio in case of urea.  
So, fertilizer nutrient ratio is 2.17 is to 1 D in case of triple superphosphate it is 5 is to 1 
Muriate potash it is 2 is to 1 gypsum in case of sulfur in gypsum we get 5.56 is to 1 and in 
case of zinc sulfate that is zinc it is 2.79 is to 1 and remember some other useful conversion 
that is 1 acre is of course 100 decimal which is around 3.0 2 bigha of  land and one hectare is 
10,000 square meter, which is 2.47 acre or 7.47 bigha.  1 katha it generally is 1.67 decimal 
and one bigha  is basically 20 katha or 33.33 decimal. So, these are some useful conversion 
we should remember while calculating the fertilizers . Generally,  the fertilizer 
recommendations are given in hectare basis. However, we can calculate it according to our 
field size.  (Refer Slide Time: 23:33 )  
 
 
So, let us see one example. So, problem one says that le t the recommended fertilizer dose for 
lowland rice b e 120, 60 and 40 kg N P 2O5 and K 2O per hectare respectively the amoun t of 
fertilizer required in the form of urea single super phosphate and Muriate of potash is 
calculated so, we know that urea content 46  percent  nitrogen so that means to supply â€¦ when 
we apply 100 kg of urea in the field that supply 46 kg of nitrogen. So, to since our 
recommended dose is 120 kg of nitrogen to supply these 120 kg of nitrogen, we need to apply 
260 kg of or 100 by 46 into 120 that is 260.9 that is 261 kg of urea.  
Similarly, if we consider the signal superphosphate  you know that single super p hosphate 
contains 16  percent  of P2O5. So, our recommended dose is 60  percent  or 60 kg P 2O5 per hectare. So, to supply the 60 kg P2O5 we require  375 kg of single super phosphate. If we 
want to meet the requirement using a straight fertilizer like single sup er phosphate.  
Now, in case of potash we know that Muriate of potash content 58  percent  to 60  percent  K2O 
so, to supply this 40 kg K2O, to supply this 40 kg K2O per hectare we require  generally 
according to our it is 120 kg 60 kg and 40 kg so, 120 kg is ni trogen requirements 60 kg is 
phosphate requirement and in case of potash it is 40 kg requirement . So, 100 by 58 by 40 so, 
we get 68.9 or 69 kg of M OP sometime you will see that people are using 60 per cent K2O 
that is also  okay  in case of M OP.  
(Refer Slide  Time: 25:49)  
 
Just here also here you can see that they are considering the per cent K2O as 60 in case of 
MOP So, both of them are fine, you can use either , generally we use 60  percent . So, here the 
problem is calculate the quantity of urea single super phosphate and mutator potash required 
for one hectare of rice with the nitrogen P2O5  and K2O 100 50 50 kg per hectare. So, we 
know that in urea percent of nitrogen is 46 in single super phosphate percent P 2O5 is 16 and 
in MOP percent gateway is 60. So, her e you can see they  are taking 60 kg I mean 60  percent  
K2O in case of MOP.  
So, the declared amount of fertilizer is 100 multiplied by those of nutrient by nutrient content 
in the applied fertilizer. So, this is this  simple formula. So, here for nitrogen we  get 100 by 46 
into 100 because our recommended dose is 100 . So, 217 kg per hectare. So, the re quired 
similarly for SSP we can calculate 100 by 16 multiplied by 50 that is 312 and re quired amount of M OP is 100 by 16 to 50 that is 83 kg per hectare. So, the  required amount of urea 
SSP and M OP for one hectare of land is 217.4 312.5 and 83.33 kg respectively.  
(Refer Slide Time: 27:21 )  
 
Now, another problem is th ere is a problem with a blended mixture fertilizer. So, the question 
is prepared 600 kg of 4 8 10 So, this is a gr ade, fertilizer grade 4 kg nitrogen , 8 kg of P2O5  
and 10 kg of K 2O. So, 4 8 10 fertilizer mixture in which half of the nitrogen is in ammonium 
sulfate, which contained 20  percent  nitrogen and the other half divided between nitrate of 
soda that is 16  percent , nitrogen and tankage which contains 6  percent  nitrogen and 6  percent  
P2O5. Now, P 2O5 and K2O are to be added in the form of superphosphate which contains 16  
percent  P2O5 and Muriate of potash which contains 60 percent  K2O.  
Now, in the present example remember our recommended dose is 4 kg of nitrogen and 
according to our problem we have to  for 4 kg of nitrogen in every 100 kg of this mixture is 
supplied with 2 kg of ammonium sulfate and then 2 kg nitrous as ammonium sulfate, so, half 
of it should come from the ammonium sulfate and  1 kg will come 1 kg of nitrogen will come 
from nitrate of soda and 1 kg of nitrogen will come from tankage. So, let us calculate.  (Refer Slide Time: 28:54 )  
 
 
So, for 2 kg nitrogen we require 10 kg ammonium sulfate same formula, we know that 
ammonium sulfate content 20 kg of nitrogen so  to supply 2 kg of nitrogen we require 2 into 
20 so, from 100 kg of ammonium sulfate we get 20 kg of nitrogen. So, for getting 2 kg of 
nitrogen we require 10 kg of ammonium sul fate. Similarly, for 1 kg of nitrogen from the 
nitrate of soda we require 1 by 16 into 100 so that is 6.25 kg and for 1 kg of nitrogen from 
tankage we require 16.66 kg. So, we record 16 .60 kg of tankage mixed with every 100 kg of 
fertilizer. So, also tankage contains nitrogen and phosphoric acid.  
So, we have already we already know that for to supply the required amount of nitrogen, we 
required 16.66 kg of nitrogen of tankage. Now, we have to calculate how much P2O5 is 
supplied by that 16.66 kg of tankage.  Now, we know that so this mixture that i f we go to the question is it already says that the tank age contains 6  percent  of P2O5 . So, the 16  percent  of 
16.66 kg of tankage will contain 1 kg of P2O 5. So, 1 kg of P2O5 is being already supplied by 
this tankage .  
(Refer Slide Time: 30:44)  
 
Now, the total P2O5 requirement to prepare for every 100 kg is generally 4 8 10 fertilizer 
mixture. So, generally  8 kg. So, among these  8 kg, tankage has already supplied 1 kg. So, the 
rest 7 kg has to be supplied through  single superphosphate. Now, we know in case of single 
superphosphate it contain 16 percent  of P2O5 .  
So, say for 7 kg of P2O5 , we require 43.75 kg of superphosphate So, we require  43.75 kg of 
superphosphate similarly, for K2O  we require 10 by 16 into 10 that is 16.66 kg of M OP. So, 
this is required for supplying this 10 kg of K 2O in 100 kg or mixed fertilizer so, once we 
calculate all these .  (Refer Slide Time: 31:45 )  
 
 
 So, the total quantity of various fertilizers required  to prepare this 100 kg of these 4 8 10 
fertilizer mixtures  we will be ammonium sulfate 10 kg nitrate of soda 6.25 kg , tankage 16.66 
kg superphosphate 43.75 kg and Muriate of potash 1 6.66 kg. So, the total quantity of the state 
fertilizer is 93.32 kg. So,  you will know that to create th ese 100 kg volume pickup or weight 
makeup, we need to add the 6.68 kg of filler materials. So, we require 6.68 kg of filler 
material.  
Now, the total quantity of various fertilizer required to prepare 600 kg of these 4 8 10 
fertilizer mixtures  will we just  have to multiply with 6 and ultimately, we can get this finally, 
result 37.5 kg of â€¦ so  60 kg of ammonium sulfate a nitrate of soda 37.5 kg tankage 100 kg 
superphosphate 262.5 kg Muriate of potash 100 kg filler 40 kg total 600 kg .  
Now, remember guys  in th e fertilizer mixture which are available in the market , Indian 
market are mainly S uphala which content 15 15  15 with the fertilizer grid and Suphala 20 20 
0 then Lakshmi 12  12 12 , Lakshmi 8  8 8, IFFCO 1 that is 10 26 26 and IFFCO 2 that is 12  32 
16. So, th ese are the fertilizer mixture which are commonly available in Indian market.  
(Refer Slide Time: 33:24 )  
 
Another problem is if the recommended dose of fertilizer is 120 60 40 kg per hectare, then 
calculate how much DAP urea and MOP will be required.  Now , first we calculate from DAP 
because it is a complex fertilizer. So, we already know the DAP cont ain 18 percent  of 
nitrogen and 46  percent  of P2O5. So, let us first calculate from the P 2O5. So, we know that 
46 kg of the P 2O5 is supplied by 100 kg of DAP. So, our requirement is 60 kg so the 60 kg of 
the P2O5 will be supplied by 100 into 60 by 4 6, that is 130.43 kg of DAP.  So, we have first calculated our DAP requirement based on our phosphate requirement. Now, 
remember that in the DAP apart from this phosp hate we also have 18  percent  of ni trogen. So, 
we know 100 kg of DA P contains 18 kg of nitrous and so, this 130 kg of DAP will contain 
this 23.48 kg of nitro gen also so, these 23 kg of nitrogen comes from the DAP our 
requirement is total 120 kg.  
So, the re st of the requirement is 120 minus 23 that is 97 kg. So, this 97 kg of nitrogen should 
be supplied by the nitrogenous fertilizer, what is the nitrogenous fertilizer urea is a 
nitrogenous fertilizer. So, the urea requirement is 100 by 46 into 97 that is 210 .87 kg per 
hectare. And finally,  MOP required is 100 by 16 into 40 that is 6 6.67 kg per hectare. This is 
how we calculate the fertilizer  requirement when there is a compound fertilizer.  
(Refer Slide Time: 35:14 )  
 
Now, the last problem  is if a soil is ha ving C EC of  20 milliequivalent  per 100 grams soil and 
it has calcium obtained milliequivalent per 100-gram  magnesium or 5 milliequivalent  for 
100-gram  potassium of 2 milliequivalent  for 1 00 gram and sodium of 1 milliequivalent  for 
100 gram calculate calciu m magnesium potassium sodium in kg per hectare, 1 hectare of soil 
we know 2.2 kg per hectare in soil.  
So, one we know that for calcium it is contained 1 milliequivalent  per 100 gram that is 20 
milligram per 100 gram 1 milliequivalent  of calcium means 20 m illigram per 100 gram. So, 
20 milligram per 100 gram means in 1000 gram  or kg we have 200 milligram , so, that means 
200 ppm, then we have to multiply 200 into 2.24 so, ppm multiplied by 2.24 gives us the kg 
per hectare. So, this is how we calculate the kg per hectare content of calcium.  Similarly, for magnesium  that is one milliequivalent  12 mg  and then similarly you can 
calculate the content of magnesium in kg per hectare and similarly for potassium and 
similarly for sodium. So, this is how you calculate t he concentration of these elements in kg 
per hectare.  
(Refer Slide Time: 36:40 )  
 
Okay guys, so, these are the differences which I have used. I hope that you have learned how 
to calculate the fertilizer requirement, if possible. We  will also discuss some  more examples 
in our upcoming lectures. And so, let us meet in our next week of lectures to discuss more 
about fertilizer control and how to maintain the fertilizer quality and so on. So, we  will 
discuss all these in our next week of lectures. Thank you .
