Lecture 18 
Soil Secondary Nutrients and Their Role in Plant Nutrition (Cont.)  
Welcome friends to this  lecture number 18 of NPTEL  Online Certification Course of Soil 
Fertility and Fertilizers . And we are at week 4 where we are discussing Soil Secondary Nutrients 
and Their Role in Plant Nutrition . In our past  lecture 16 and 17 we have discussed about the 
calcium  and we have also started discussing about sulphur .  
In the lecture 16 we have discussed about  calcium and importance of calcium for plant nutrition , 
what are the different calcium sources and also what are the calcium  deficiencies in the plants 
like bloss om end rot , then cork spot, we have also discussed . In our previous lecture we have 
started discussing about sulphur  and sulphur  is also very important secondary nutrient .  
And it is required for the protein synthesis because it is a component of different  essential amino 
acids like cysteine , cystin e and methionine . So these sulphur  compounds , organic compounds are 
essential for the growth and growth of the plants . Now sulphur is available to the plants in the 
form of sulphate , which is SO42 minus and we ha ve also seen different types of sources of 
sulphur  minerals like we have discussed about pyrites . We have discussed about galena and so 
on. So today in this lecture we are going to  start from there .  (Refer Slide Time: 2:06)  
 
And these are the concepts which we are going to cover in this lecture . First of all , sulphur 
fertilizer , their factors  affecting  sulphur availability and also nitrogen to sulphur  ratio and also 
what are the deficiency symptoms of sulphur .  
(Refer Slide Time: 2:21)  
 
So these are t he keywords for this lecture  like NS ratio, ammonium sulphate , then gypsum , then 
sulphur  metabolism , chlorosis , these are some of the important  keywords which we are going to 
discuss in this lecture .  (Refer Slide Time: 2:38)  
 
Now let us see first what a re the important sulphur  fertilizers . So these are some of the important 
sulphur fertilizers like nitrate sulphate , which contains 5 to  14 percent of sulphur , then 
ammonium sulphate , which is the major  sulphur fertilizer which contains  24 percent of sulphu r, 
then simple superphosphate contains 12 percent of sulphur , then ammonium sulphate phosphate 
contains 14 to 20 percent of sulphur .  
Calcium sulphate contains 14 to 18 percent of sulphur . Potassium sulphate contains 16 to 22 of 
sulphur . Calcium magnesium sulphate contains 22 percent of sulphur . Magnesium contains 18 
percent of sulphur  and magnesium sulfate , which is also known as kieserite, so there are two 
types of magnesium sulphate salts , one is Epsom salts , which contain 18 percent , another is 
magnesiu m sulfate which is kieserite  contains 22 percent of  sulphur .  
And so there are different types of sources for elemental sulphur . First of all , the elemental 
sulphur contains 85 to 100 percent of sulphur . Triple superphosphate granulated with sulphur 
will c ontain 18 percent sulphur and sulphur bentonite contains 85 to 90 percent of sulphur . So 
these are some of the sulphur sources  which we can apply as fertilizer to correct the sulphur 
deficiency .  (Refer Slide Time: 4:13)  
 
Now let us first start discussi ng with the ammonium sulphate . So this ammonium sulphate looks 
like this white crystalline salt like compound , now it has 24 percent sulphur  and it has water 
solubility of 750 grams per liter and  solution p H of this ammonium sulphate can  vary from p H 5 
to 6. Now remember that 70 percent of this global output of this ammonium sulphate originates 
from the production of caprolactam .  
And the main advantage of ammonium sulphate are  they have low hygroscopicity and they have 
chemical stability also . So this is t he structure of ammonium sulphate .  (Refer Slide Time: 5:03)  
 
And so the formula of ammonium sulphate is NH4 w hole 2SO4. P roperties we can see here 
molar mass of 132.14 gram per mole , density is 1.769 gram per cc at 20 degree centigrade and 
melting poin t of this ammonium sulphate varies from 235 to 280 degree centigrade . And so 
which is equivalent to 455 to 536  degree Fahrenheit and 508 to 553 Kelvin .  
So these are some of the  characteristics of ammonium sulphate . So ammonium sulphate is a salt 
like comp ound you can , this is what ammonium sulphate looks like . So apart from nitrogen  
which contains around 20 to 21 percent it also supplies the sulphur  as a secondary nutrient .  (Refer Slide Time: 6:01)  
 
So single superphosphate it  contains  11 to 12 percent  of sulphur and single superphosphate is 
also known as ordinary superphosphate or normal superphosphate or simple superphosphate . So 
it is composed of 50 percent by weight of monocalcium phosphate as well as gypsum or its lower 
hydrate . So this thing singl e superphosphate is also another  phosphatic fertâ€¦ another fertilizer 
which contain this secondary sulphur . 
Another sulphur  source is ammonium phosphate sulphate , which is composed of 40 percent 
mono ammonium phosphate and 60 percent ammonium sulphate . The m ost common grade of 
ammonium phosphate sulphate is given there that is 16 -20-0-14 percent sulphur and it is made of 
reacting a mixture of phosphoric acid and sulphur ic acid with ammonia and introducing 
ammonium sulphate solution and sulphur ic acid into a p hosphoric acid plant reaction circuit . So 
this ammonium phosphate sulphate is another sulphur fertilizer .  (Refer Slide Time: 7:13)  
 
 
Potassium sulphate - Now potassium sulphate generally it varies from sulphur contents varies 
from 16 to 22 percent . So we have already  discussed here in the potassium sulphate that is 16 to 
22 percent , so again  here we can see that the potassium sulphate sulphur content varies from 16 
to 22 percent . About 25 percent of the world  potassium sulphate capacity is based on the  reaction 
between potassium chloride and H2SO4.  
So when there is a reaction between potassium chloride and sulphur ic acid that will create this 
potassium sulphate . Gypsum which is calcium sulphate dehydrate,  so this is another important sulphur source . So in case of gypsum it contains 14 to 18 percent of sulphur . So gypsum by 
product comes from different fossil fuel power station where sulphur is scrubbed from exhaust 
gases . It is also called the land plaster .  
So generally gypsum is used  for plastering pu rposes , so also known as plaster of Parries. 
Improves , when we apply this  gypsum it improves acid soils and treats  aluminum  toxicity and  
improves the  water infiltration and soil structure . However , gypsum is mainly applied for 
correcting the alkalinity of the soil .  
So what happens when we apply the gypsum into the soil that the calcium from the gypsum 
replaces the sodium from the alkaline soil and thereby , improves the physical condition of the 
soil. So to reduce the alkalinity of the soil  we generally app ly gypsum . Gypsum is another 
important source of sulphur , which contains 14 to 18 percent of sulphur .  
So if we see the whatever  sources which we have discussed , we have already discussed this  
ammonium  sulphate , we have discussed , sorry , we have discussed this ammonium sulphate , we 
have discussed this single or simple superphosphate , we have also discussed this ammonium 
sulphate phosphate and then  we have discussed this potassium sulphate . So these are some of the 
major  sulphur fertilizers  which we apply fo r correcting the sulphur deficiency in crop plants .  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:06 )  
 Let us now discuss what are the factors which affect the sulphur availability in the soil . First 
important factor is type an amount of clay . So higher amount of clay decrease s the sulphur 
availability . Secondly  the p H, pH is the amount of release d sulphur is directly proportional to 
soil p H up to p H 7.5. Third is organic matter , as we know that sulphur is an important 
component of several  essential amino acids or proteins .  
So of course , the higher organic matter implies higher sulphur supplying capacity  in the soil , so 
higher organic matter facilitates the sulphur supply to soil .  
(Refer Slide Time: 10:53 )  
 
Salt content is another important factor because accumulation of sul phur favored in soils of high 
salt content like coastal saline and alkaline soil . So wherever there are saline soils that will help 
in accumulation of sulphur compounds . Cations and anions are also important factors . Acid soil 
containing  higher amount of p roton retain a greater amount of sulphate sulphur .  
Presence or absence of vegetation - A greater amount of sulphur is mineralized in the cropped 
soil as compared to the uncropped soil . So the salt contain cations and anions and presence or 
absence of vege tation all these are important factors which governs the sulphur availability to the 
crop.  (Refer Slide Time: 11:42 )  
 
Another  important factor is alternate wetting and drying . So drying after soil saturation can 
reduce the sulphur content in the soil . So that is also important factor . And finally interaction of 
sulphur with other nutrients are also  important  for controlling the sulphur availability to the 
plant . So the application of zinc increase d the utilization of sulphur by the crops and the 
interac tion of nitrogen and sulphur  found to be synergistic in nature .  
So of course , this nitrogen and sulphur are synergistic because they perform  almost some similar  
functions within the plant body . So a similar positive interaction has found between sulphur a nd 
phosphorus . So we can see some similarity between nitrogen and sulphur and also interestingly 
there are some similarity between nitrogen and sulphur deficiency symptoms .  
Although there are some stark differences we are going to discuss this  in this upc oming slide , but 
remember there is some confusions of , there may be some confusion regarding the nitrogen as 
well as sulphur deficiency symptoms in the plants and there are certain ways to detect those , we 
are going to discuss those .  (Refer Slide Time: 13:02)  
 
So if we see the availability of the elements at different soil p H we can see that although with the 
increase of soil p H, the availability of iron , manganese , copper , zinc and aluminum decreases , 
but the availability of molybdenum , calcium , magnes ium and nitrogen sulphur and potassium 
increases . So the temp , the raising the soil p H up to 7.5 will have the  beneficial effect to the 
availability of sulphur .  
(Refer Slide Time: 13:42 ) 
 So NS, let us discuss then NS ratio. So sulphur metabolism in plan t is closely linked with 
nitrogen as both the constituents are ; as both nitrogen and sulphur  are constituents of protein , so 
NS ratios generally  vary from 15 to 16 is to 1 for legume . For cereals is vary from 11 to 12 is to 
1 and so basically you can see h ere nitrogen is greater in legumes , of course .  
And NS ratio of 10 is to 1 in fertilizer can meet the sulphur requirement of the crops . So in the 
absence of sulphur  in the soil utilization of nitrate can be also hampered , because they have some 
synergistic  relationship . Utilization of nitrate can also be hampered if there is sulphur deficiency 
in the soil .  
(Refer Slide Time: 14:33 )  
 
Now what are the symptoms of sulphur deficiency ? Sulphur deficiency symptoms appear first on 
the younger leaves . So this is  the most stark difference with the nitrogen deficiency symptoms . 
Remember that in case of nitrogen deficiency symptoms the , since nitrogen is mobile within the 
plant , so nitrogen deficiency symptoms occur in the older leaves .  
But in case of sulphur , sulphur is relatively immobile within the plant , so that is why sulphur 
deficiency occurs first in the younger leaves . Fruits also do not mature fully and remains light 
green in color . So this is another important feature of sulphur deficiency . Poor nodulation  in 
legumes and leaves also become pale yellow or light green and maturity in cereal is delayed and in cotton , tobacco and citrus some of the older leaves are also affected first . So we can see these 
are some common  sulphur deficiency symptoms .  
(Refer Sli de Time: 15:34 )  
 
Interveinal chlorosis  is also important deficiency symptoms which we are going to discuss . So 
you can see here it is a sulphur deficiency , severe sulphur deficiency in wheat . So this is the 
normal healthy wheat plant and here you can see  sulphur deficient wheat.  So you can clearly see 
what is the importance of sulphur  for the plant growth .   
(Refer Slide Time: 15:55 )  
  
Another is  picture you can see here one is with proper dose of sulphur and here you can see the 
sulphur deficient . So sulphur sufficient and sulphur  deficient , so you can see the changes . As you 
can remember I have already told you that  there are some color changes when  there is a sulphur 
deficiency , so that can be  easily seen here  in this cabbage leaves .  
(Refer Slide Ti me: 16:23 )  
 
Also we can see some interveinal chlorosis and pale strips visible between the veins , so that is 
why it is called interv einal chlorosis . So these are the banana leaves , so you can see interveinal  
chlorosis can be easily seen  for sulphur defic iency .  (Refer Slide Time: 16:40 )  
 
Also you can see here this is th is photograph showing the sulphur deficiency in ground nut .  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:47 )  
 
So this is showing sulphur deficiency in lettuce .  (Refer Slide Time: 16:52 )  
 
And here you can  see sulphur deficiency in potato .  
(Refer Slide Time: 16:59 )  
 
So as I told you there can be some confusion between  the symptoms of sulphur deficiency and 
nitrogen deficiency . So you should remember two important thing , one is in case of nitrogen 
deficie ncy classic symptoms description is yellowing  of the lower or older leaves from the leaf 
tip to the base down the midrib .  So these  symptoms generally occur in the older leaves first . In case of sulphur  deficiency classic 
symptom description is yellowing of new leaves in the who rl, sometimes with the interveinal  
stripping . So that is what is called interveinal  chlorosis , with lower leaves remaining uniform 
green . So since the sulphur is relatively immobile , of course , that is why the sulphur deficiency 
symp toms appear in the new leaves .  
(Refer Slide Time: 17:52 )  
 
Now both nitrogen and sulphur are tied together due to several common physiological processes . 
Therefore , early growth symptoms can be similar , so I told you that both nitrogen and sulphur  
are im portant components of protein . So you can expect that  they have some common 
physiological processes . So the early growth symptoms can be similar . Examples  can be 
including overall leaf and plant yellowing , spindly plants and interveinal  stripping .  
And the se similar symptoms most often occur when plants are small and there is severe 
deficiency , there is low soil supply and no fertilization . Also plant response from fertilizer 
application can be quite similar for nitrogen and sulphur that is good growth and green plants 
with uniform coloration . So when you apply the fertilizer in the soil both nitrogen and sulphur 
fertilizer will see some plant response .  
So the plant response can be similar in both these cases because they have similar physiological  
roles in  the plant body . So we can see good growth and green plants with uniform coloration .  (Refer Slide Time: 19:13 )  
 
So guys so that makes the end of a discussion of sulphur . So we have learned that sulphur is a 
very important component . It has  role for  grow th of the plant and sulphur is an important 
component of cruciferous plant and sulphur  is present as a structural component of different 
essential amino acids so they f orm the proteins also and they have similarity in physiological 
process , physiological r oles as we can see in case of nitrogen .  
So nitrogen and sulphur deficiency symptoms are almost same , however , in case of nitrogen 
deficiency symptoms occur in the older leaves because of its mobility within the plant however , 
in case of sulphur the  defici ency symptoms occur in the newer leaves because of relative 
immobility within the plants .  
We have also discussed different sources of sulphur and also sulphur fertilizers , we have 
discussed about single super phosphate , we have discussed about ammonium su lphate , we have 
discussed about gypsum . And so these are the common  sulphur  source , which we apply to 
correct any sulphur deficiency .  
One of the major sulphur deficiency symptoms is interve inal chlorosis . So chlorosis occurs 
within the veins , so that is w hy it is known as interve inal chlorosis . So we have also discussed 
the sulphur cycle . So I hope that you have got , you have gathered some useful knowledges from 
this lecture and let us wrap up this lecture .  These are some of the references , which I have u sed for  this for this lecture and let us meet in our 
next lecture to discuss the  magnesium and its importance for plant metabolism . Thank you.
