Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
Good
afternoon.
In
the
previous
class,
we
have
said
all
the
gas,
all
the
all
the
thermodynamic
laws
and
we
have
also
discussed
about
the
Carnot
heat
engine
cycle,
reversibility ,
and
also
the
entropy
right.
So,
in
the
basics
of
thermodynamics,
this
class,
the
topic
which
is
of
course,
taking
a
little
time,
because
this
is
the
fundamental
thing.
Now ,
if
we
look
at,
if
the
gas
to
be
a
perfect
gas
right.
If
the
gas
to
be
a
perfect
gas,
then
from
the
equation
of
state,
we
can
write
p
V
is
equal
to
RT
or
p
v
is
equal
to
mRT
or
we
can
also
write
p
v
is
equal
to
n
R
bar
T.
So,
this
we
can
write
that
p
into
small
v
is
equal
to
capital
T,
where
p
is
the
absolute
pressure
in
kilo
Pascal,
v
is
the
specific
volume,
small
v
which
is
niu
or
small
v
you
can
write
here,
in
meter
cube
per
kg,
capital
V
is
the
volume
in
meter
cube
and
is
v
bar
that
is
molal
volume
in
meter
cube
per
kg
mole,
v
bar
is meter cube per kg mole right.
pV
=
RT;
or,
pv
=
mRT;
or,
pv
=
n
T;
or,
p
=
T.
where,
p
is
the
absolute
pressure
in
kPa,
v
is
the
specific
volume
in
m
3
/
kg,
V
is
volume
in
m
3
and
v
is
molal
volume
in
m
3
per kg mole.
T
is
the
temperature
in
K,
is
universal
gas
constant
in
kJ
/
(kg
mole
K),
and
R
is
gas
constant
for
a
particular
gas
in
kJ
/
(kg
K).
Hence,
=
8.314
kJ
/
(kg
mole
K),
and R =
/ M,   M is the molecular weight of gas
in kg / kg mole.
T
is
the
temperature
in
Kelvin,
R
is
universal
gas
constant,
So,
we
can
write
here
that
capital
R
is
universal
gas
constant
in
kilo
joules
per
kg
mole
per
Kelvin
right.
Of
course,
it
is
it
can
be
written
as
capital
R
bar
which
was
here
this
capital
R
bar
right
is
universal
gas
constant
in
kilo
joules
per
kg
mole
per
Kelvin
and
capital
R
is
the
gas
constant
for
a
particular
gas
in
kilo
joules
per
kg
Kelvin
right.
So,
R
bar
can
be
written
as
8.314
kilo
joules
per
kg
mole
per
Kelvin
and
capital
R
right
and
capital
R
is
capital
R
is
R
bar
over
m
that
is
m
is
the
molecular
weight
of
the
gas
in
kg
per
kg
mole.
So,
these
relations
are
valid
above
critical
temperature
and
low
pressure
where
intermolecular
forces
are
negligible.
So,
there
is
no
intermolecular
forces.
Now
intermolecular
forces,
if
you
remember ,
that
gas
law,
that,
which
we
have
also
learnt
in
chemistry ,
that
the
gas
law
in
the
sense
where
there
is
no
force
of
attraction,
that
was
the
fundamental
of
the
gas
law,
right
that
kinetic
theory
of
gases.
There
we
have
said
that
the
molecules
are
free
to
move randomly all around right.
So,
here
we
are
saying
that
intermolecular
forces
are
negligible
if
it
is
under
perfect
gas.
For
perfect
gas
we
can
also
write,
U
is
equal
to,
U
is
a
function
of
T,
right,
U
that
is
internal
energy
is
a
function
of
T,
and
h
is
equal
to
U
plus
p
v
that
is
again
U
as
a
function of T plus R T that means,  h is also a function of T.
u = u (T), and h = u + pv = u(T) + R T = h (T).
u
2
– u
1
= C
v
(T
2
– T
1
);  and  h
2
– h
1
= C
p
(T
2
– T
1
).
Hence
enthalpy
of
a
perfect
gas
is
also
a
function
of
temperature
only.
Hence,
between
two
state
points
1
and
2,
if
it
is
ideal
gas
mixture,
then
ideal
gas
mixture
means
a
mixture
of
ideal
gases,
say
if
A
and
B
are
there,
two
gases,
the
molecular
forces
of
attraction
between
the
molecules
of
each
constituent
gas,
that
is
A
and
B,
is
AA
or
BB
and
this
AA
or
BB
we
can
assume
to
be
equal
to
0.
So,
if
these
are
ideal
gases,
then
only
this
AA
intermolecular
forces
between
the
same
molecules
and
BB
that
is
again
another
intermolecular
forces
between
the
same
molecules
are
equal
to
0,
right,
and
if
the
mixture
is
to
be
a
perfect
gas
then
also
the
intermolecular
forces
between
A
and
B,
that
is
AB has to be 0, if it is to be a perfect gas.
So,
let
us
consider
a
volume
V
of
the
gas,
molecules
of
A
and
B
at
a
pressure
of
p
and
temperature
of
T.
So,
each
of
the
gases
is
assumed
to
follow
the
ideal
gas
relation,
then
if
again,
if
we
assume
MA
and
MB
be
the
masses
of
the
constituent
gases
and
M
only
M
be
the
mass
of
the
resultant
mixture.
Then
from
the
conservation
of
mass
we
can
write
M
is
equal
to
MA
plus
MB.
Therefore,
we
can
also
write
PA
into
V
plus
that
PA
into
V
is
equal
to
MA
into
RA
into
T
and
PB
is
equal
to
MB
into
RB
into
T
and
also
you
can
write
PV
is
equal
to
MRT,
where
R
is
equal
to
MA
RA
plus
MB
RB
over
M.
Then,
if
the
gases
are
mixed
adiabatically ,
without
any
change
in
kinetic
and
potential
energy,
and
without
any
work
output
then
according
to
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
in
steady state, the initial and final enthalpies are also same  right.
So,
this
we
keep
in
mind
and
the
mixture
can
be
said
to
have
an
enthalpy
which
can
be
written
as
h
equal
to
MA
hA
plus
MB
hB
over
M.
So,
if
we
make
it,
in
its
differential
form,
we
can
write
Mdh
is
equal
to
MA
dhA
plus
MB
dhB.
So,
we
can
say
that
for
a
perfect
gas
dh
is
equal
to
Cp
dT
therefore,
the
specific
heat
of
the
mixture
can
be
written
as
Cp
equal
to
MA
CpA
plus
MB
CpB
over
M.
Similarly ,
the
internal
energy
of
the
mixture
also
can
be
written
as
U
is
equal
to
MA
UA
plus
MB
UB
over
M
and
therefore,Cv
can
be
written
as
MA
CpA
plus
MB
CpB
over
M.
Since
the
entropy
of
a
mixture
is
not
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
entropies
of
the
individual
components,
the
entropy
of
the
mixing
has
to
be
included
and
this
lets
us
to
the
process
of
irreversibility ,
because
entropy
of
A
and
entropy
of
B,
if
we
add
them,
then
the
resultant
entropy
should
be
addition of these two, but it is not.
s
2
– s
1
= C
v
ln (T
2
/ T
1
) + R ln (v
2
/ v
1
)
and,
s
2
– s
1
= C
p
ln (T
2
/ T
1
) + R ln (p
2
/ p
1
)
In
a
constant
volume
heat
transfer
process,
the
work
done
w
1-2
=
0,
So,
from
first
law,
q
1-2 
=
u
2
–
u
1
=
C
v
(T
2
–
T
1
).
Similarly ,
for
constant
pressure
process,
q
1-2
=
h
2
–
h
1
=
C
p
(T
2
–
T
1
).
So,
this
means
we
are
heading
towards
irreversibility
and
the
irreversible
process
is
that
when
we
are
mixing
and
this
mixing
is
a
irreversible
process.
Now ,
if
it
is
to
be
a
real
gas
and
vapour
then
forces
of
attraction
between
molecules
are
not
negligible,
because
if
these
are
real
gas,
in
kinetic
theory
also,
you
have
seen.
Earlier
attempt
to
attempt
to
relate
thermodynamic
properties
was
known
as
Van
der
Waal
equation
and
this
is
one
of
the
earliest
relationship
where
p
plus
a
by
v
bar
square
into
v
bar
minus
b,
that
is
equal
to
R
bar
into
T,
where
of
course,
a
by
v
bar
square
accounts
for
forces
of
attractions
between
molecules,
B
and
A,
right,
between
molecules,
and
b
is
the
finite
volume
of
B
molecule.
The
constants
a
and
b,
were
found
by
looking
at
the
isotherm
passing
through
the
critical
point,
which
is
supposed
to
have
a
point
of
inflection
there.
So,
we
can
write
a
is
equal
to
27
by
64
R
bar
square
T
critical
square
over
p
critical
and
b
is
R
bar
T
critical
over
8
p
critical.
Of
course,
T
critical
T
c
and
p
c
are
critical
temperature
and
pressure
respectively .
Other
equations
are
also
known,
but
they
are
not
so
popular
as
that
of
the
Van
der
Waals.
Van
der
Waals
was
the
very
earliest
for
real
gas
and
vapour ,
and
is
mostly ,
it
is
used,
but
some
other
relations
are
like
that,
that
is
dieterici
equation,
then
B
T
Bridgman
equation,
then
Benedict
Webb
Rubin
equation,
It
can
be
said,
BWR
equation,
then
Redlich-Nolm
equation,
then
Penn-Robinson
equation
etc.
These
are
all
the
intermolecular
forces,
how
much
is
there,
they
can
be
predicted,
and
the
relation
between
PV
with
the
intermolecular
forces
and
volume
of
the
molecule.
In
the
real
gas,
the
volume
of
the
molecule is not neglected, neither the intermolecular  forces are neglected.
So,
they
have
a
new
relation
that
is
p
plus
a
by
v
bar
square
into
v
bar
minus
b
is
equal
to
R
bar
into
T,
instead
of
PV
is
equal
to
RT.
So,
this
can
be
a
new
relation
for
real
gases
right.
Now ,
if
it
is
a
dry
air,
right,
we
do
not
know
what
will
be
the
condition.
So,
that
is
why
everything
we
are
covering
that,
if
it
is
a
dry
air,
then
one
of
the
aims
of
air
conditioning
is
to
control
water
vapour
from
a
mixture
of
dry
air
and
water
vapour
that
is
moist
air.
Standard
air
is
considered
to
be
consisted
of
78.08
percent
of
nitrogen
and
20.96
or
95
percent
of
oxygen
on
volume
basis.
The
molecular
weight
and
gas
constant
of air are 28.966  kg per kg mole and 0.2871 kilo joules per kg kelvin.
In
most
of
the
cases,
air
will
be
considered
as
perfect
gas,
and
it
has
been
precisely
measured
and
concluded
that
at
sufficiently
low
pressure,
and
temperature,
well
above
the
critical
temperature
and
pressure
or
critical
temperature,
it
has
been
found
that
within
the
temperature
range
of
minus
75
to
100
degree
centigrade
dry
air
behaves
like
a
perfect
gas.
For
air
conditioning,
the
range
of
temperature
may
be
between
0
to
50
degree
centigrade
and
the
heat
capacity
values
of
air,
that
can
be
taken
as
C
p
equal
to
1.05
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin
and
C
v
equal
to
0.7179
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin.
So,
properties
of
pure substance, if  we look at, then, it can be said who is the pure substance.
Now ,
pure
substance
we
can
say
to
that
whose
chemical
composition
does
not
change
during
thermodynamic
processes
for
example,
water
refrigerants.
So,
they
are
pure
substances
because
their
properties
does
not
change
during
the
thermodynamic
processes.
Water
exists
in
three
states
for
example,
water ,
water
vapour
and
ice
that
is
steam
and
hot
water
are
used
in
heating
buildings
where
as
chilled
whereas,
chilled
water
is
used
for
cooling
buildings.
So,
what
is
refrigerant?
Refrigerant
is
that
substance
those
absorb
heat
from
other
substances
or
space.
If
a
liquid
which
is
a
pure
substance
is
heated
at
constant
pressure
the
temperature
at
which
it
boils
is
called
saturation
temperature.
At
this
temperature
the
liquid
and
the
associated
vapour
at
the
same
temperature
are
in
equilibrium
and
are
called
saturated
liquid
and
saturated
vapour
of
course,
respectively .
The
saturation
temperature
is
a
function
of
pressure
only
and
at
atmospheric
pressure
the
saturation
temperature
is
called
normal
boiling
point.
And
the
temperature
corresponding
to
the
reverse
phenomena
is
known
as
dew
point
temperature.
Hence
for
a
pure
substance
the
dew
point
and
boiling
point
are
same
at
a
constant
pressure.
The
similar
situation
appears
for
a
solid
and
a
liquid
and
the
phenomena
which
exists
in
this
case
aremelting
and
freezing
and
corresponding
temperatures
are
melting
point
temperature
and
freezing point temperature.
Here
also
for
a
pure
substance
the
melting
point
and
freezing
point
temperatures
are
also
same.
So,
the
temperature
at
which
all
three
phases
of
all
pure
substances
exist
in
equilibrium
is
called
triple
point.
The
liquid
vapour
phase
diagram
can
conveniently
be
shown
in
a
pressure
enthalpy
or
temperature
entropy
or
any
other
convenient
way
such
as
three
dimensional
PVT
diagram.
Except
dry
ice
manufacture
we
come
across
liquid
and
vapour
phase
only.
So,
in
the
figure
we
will
show
a
typical
pH
diagram
of
a
pure
substance and where this is the typical pH diagram right.
And
here
you
see
you
have
critical
point
right,
you
have
triple
point
and
this
is
the
phase
diagram
right.
So,
this
is
vapour
and
saturated
vapour
line.
So,
these
are
liquid
lines,
these
are
liquid
and
vapour
in
between
right
and
this
side
it
is
pure
solid
and
vapour
right.
So,
this
is
a
typical
pH
diagram
and
from
there
we
can
come
across
all
the
property
values which are required right. So, if we look at what we were looking at.
So,
if
we
look
at
the
temperature
at
which
all
the
phases
of
all
pure
substance
exist
in
equilibrium
called
triple
point.
The
liquid
vapour
phase
diagram
can
conveniently
be
shown
as
we
have
shown
it.
At
critical
point
the
states
are
denoted
as
Tc,
Pc
and
Vc.
The
liquid
below
the
pressure
of
Pc
when
heated
first
become
a
mixture
of
liquid
and
vapour
and
then
becomes
saturated
vapour .
At
the
critical
point
there
is
no
distinction
between
the  saturated vapour and liquid saturated liquid right.
So,
liquid
state
F
and
saturated
vapour
state
we
call
it
to
be
G
which
merge
together
at
the
critical
point.
Now ,
for
water
the
triple
point
is
273.16
Kelvin
that
is
0.01
degree
centigrade and  61 1.
73
Pascal
that
is
0.0061 173
bar.
Critical
point
is
373.946
degree
centigrade
that
is
647.096 Kelvin and 217.
7
atmosphere
that
is
22.06
kilo
Pascal.
For
dry
ice
triple
point
is
216.55
Kelvin
and
517
kilo Pascal and critical point is 31.04 degree centigrade that is 304.
19
Kelvin
and
72.8
atmosphere
or
7380
kilo
Pascal.
Why
I
have
given
these
information
to
you?
Because
in
many
cases
liquid
carbon
dioxide
is
used
as
one
of
the
basic
in
unit
for
extraction
right.
So,
that
is
why
these
information
are
also
helpful
ok.
So,
now,
perhaps
we
have
also
shown
you
that
PHE
diagram,
TS
diagram
we
will
come
across
subsequently
and
perhaps
in
the
next
class
we
will
give
you
some
more
relations
whichare
very
useful
for
heat
and
mass
transfer
as
well
some
relation
which
are
used
in
heat
transfer for future in information ok. Thank you very much.
