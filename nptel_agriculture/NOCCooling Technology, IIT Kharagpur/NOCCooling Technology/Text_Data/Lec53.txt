Good
morning,
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
my
dear
friends.
W e
have
already
seen
that
how
the
quality
is
getting
af fected
in
freezing,
right,
and
that
manifestation
was
in
terms
of
drip
loss
right.
W ithout
spending
much
time
on
that,
because,
we
are
really
running
short
of
time,
lot
of
things
are
still
remaining.
So,
let
us
go
to
freezing
curve,
but
before
that,
let
us
look
into
also
another
very
important
definition,
and
that
is,
called
eutectic
solution,
right.
So
what
is
that?
Eutectic
solution,
before,
again,
let
it
be
because,
but,
I
do
not
know
afterwards,
yeah,
by
one
chance,
we
could.
So
eutectic
point
or
eutectic
temperature,
that
is
very
important,
why?
Because,
the
ice
cream
lollies,
which
you
consume,
they
are
manufactured
in
this
type
of
refrigeration
system.
So,
if
we
look
at
the
definition
of
eutectic
point,
or
eutectic
temperature,
it
can
be
said
that,
as
the
freeze
concentration
process
progresses,
solutes
reach
or
exceed
their
respective
saturation
concentration,
and
simultaneous
crystallization
of
ice
and
solute
becomes
possible.
The
temperature
at
which
a
crystallized
solute
can
exist
in
equilibrium
with
ice
and
unfrozen
phase
is
known
as
the
eutectic
point,
or
eutectic
temperature
of
the
solute.
So,
I
repeat,
the
temperature
at
which
a
crystallized
solute
can
exist
in
equilibrium
with
ice
and
unfrozen
phase,
is
known
as
the
eutectic
point
or
eutectic
temperature
of
the
solute.
For
example,
sodium
chloride
has
an
eutectic
point
of
minus
21.13
degree
centigrade,
sucrose
has
minus
14
degree
centigrade,
glucose
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
sodium
carbonate
minus
2.1
degree
centigrade.
So,
suppose
from
here
if
you
want
to
have
a
solution,
whose
eutectic
point
is
minus
5,
sorry ,
minus
say
17,
then
what
you
will
do
you
will
take
some
part
of
sodium
chloride
and
some
sucrose
so
that
resultant
becomes
minus
17
right.
So,
this
way
if
you
have
some
other
solutes,
whose
temperatures
or
eutectic
temperature
is
much
lower ,
maybe
minus
25,
minus
30,
minus
40
o
C,
things
like
that,
then,
a
combination
of
dif ferent
solutes,
you
can
have
your
desired
temperature,
where
you
see
that,
from
the
definition
it
is
coming
that
you
have
an
eutectic
temperature,
where
all
three
states
are
in
equilibrium,
means
till
that
point
it
is
in
the
liquid
state
in
the
solution,
right.
And
we
know
the
heat
transfer
coef ficient
of
liquid
is
much
more
than
that
of
solid,
or
gas.
So,
this
is
why
in
lolly
making,
the
refrigerating
part
is
with
the
eutectic
solution.
W e
will
come
there
afterwards,
ok.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
time
temperature
curve,
or
plot,
thatis
called
freezing
curve,
right.
This
again,
we
are
running
short
of
time.
I
will
not
spend
in
detail,
as
you
see,
from
here,
we
started
from
a
point
A,
we
are
lowering
down
the
temperature,
right
and
this
lowering
down
of
temperature,
this
type
of
heat
transfer
is
known
as
change
in
sensible
heat,
or
this
is
the
sensible
heat,
right,
ok.
Now ,
once
it
comes
to
the
point
S,
that
is,
this
is
time
versus
temperature,
right.
So,
the
point
S
is
the
super
cooled,
it
is
a
food
material,
say ,
and
its
initial
temperature
is
somewhere,
at
the
level
A,
anything,
could
be
20,
could
be
50,
could
be
30
or
could
be
10
o
C,
any
anything
you
can
have,
but
that
is
above
freezing
point,
right.
So,
from
there,
you
are
lowering
down
the
temperature
with
a
sensible
heat
change,
right,
coming
to
the
point
S,
which
is
the
sub
cooled
point,
or
super
cooled
point,
right.
So,
once
it
attains
this
point,
as
we
said
in
that
curve
of
nucleus
formation.
So
you
have
to
come
down
a
little,
so
that,
you
remember ,
that
end
started
from
here,
and
it
went
like
this,
right.
So,
you
are
lowering
down
the
temperature
to
the
point,
which
is
known
as,
that,
super
cooled
point,
right.
So,
from
there,
super
cooled
point,
you
are
again
lowering
down
temperature,
but
the
temperature
is
increasing
from
point
S
to
point
B,
where
point
B
is
the
initial
freezing
point,
right.
So
if
initial
freezing
point
is
say
B,
so
from
point
S
to
point
B,
the
temperature
is
increasing
why?
Obviously ,
the
question
comes
why?
So,
when
it
is
said
that,
why ,
it
is
because,
that,
here
you
are
forming
the
nucleus.
So,
crystallization
is
happening
and
crystallization
formation
is
an
exothermic
process,
right,
exothermic
process.
So
exothermic
process
means,
temperature
will
increase.
So,
that
is
why ,
this
rise
in
temperature
from
the
point
S
to
the
point
B,
right.
Once,
that
is
the
initial
freezing
point,
once
it
reaches,
initial
freezing
point,
ideally ,
whatever
freezable
water
is
there,
whatever
freezable
water
is
there,
that
freezes
up
to
point
C,
right.
So,
if
product
has
say
80
percent
water ,
and
20
percent
other
solid,
then,
it
may
have
90
percent
freezable
water ,
and
10
percent
unfreezable
water .
So
that,
90
percent
freezable
water
is
frozen
to
the
point
C.
Then,
if
you
lower
down
further ,
the
temperature,
it
will
go
down
to
point,
wherever
you
want,
this
may
be
minus
18,
this
may
be
minus
20,
whatever
you
feel,
right.
So,
that
is
point
D,
where,
it
is
the
again
sensible
heat,
and
this
heat
was
latent
heat,
where
the
temperature
did
not
change,
right.
But,
this
is
typically ,
an
ideal
time
temperature
relationship,
or
freezing
curve.
In
reality ,
as
we
know ,
I
have
said
earlier ,
also
shown,
that
from
the
point
B,
when
in
some
portion
has
been
frozen,
in
remaining
unfrozen
part,
the
concentration
of
solute
goes
up.
So,
since
concentration
goes
up,
the
freezing
point
gets
lowered,
right.
So,
we
get
a
freezing
curve
like
this,
instead
of
this,
we
get
a
freezing
curve
like
this,
and
then
from
this
C,
again
you
go
back
to
D,
as
much
you
want.
So,
instead
of
this
plateau,
theremay
be
an
inclined
freezing
curve,
because,
the
more
it
gets
concentrated,
the
more
the
remaining
solution
will
have
lowering
of
freezing
point,
right.
So
that,
it
is
coming
like
this.
So,
actual
freezing
curve
is
this,
and
real,
I
mean,
this
is
actual,
and
ideal
freezing
curve
is
this
right.
So,
this
is
how
we
can
explain
the
freezing
curve
for
real
and
ideal,
right.
So,
now ,
we
do
not
read
out
this
part,
you
have
already
seen,
and
perhaps
you
can
also
read
out,
the
detail,
I
have
already
said,
our
time
is
very
limited.
So,
let
us
go
to
the
next.
Some
definitions
we
need
to
know ,
that
is
called
denaturation.
Y ou
know
that
denaturation
happens
with
protein,
right.
So,
an
alteration
of
protein,
in
which
intermolecular
cross
linking
take
place,
that
permanently
changes
the
physical
and
chemical
properties
of
the
protein,
is
known
as
denaturation.
Then,
drip
loss
or
drip,
drip,
we
have
already
said,
the
expressible
fluid,
from
say ,
fish
flesh,
or
any
other ,
right.
So,
the
volume
of
drip
increases
denaturation.
So,
the
loss,
which
is
coming,
because
of
that,
your
freezing
technique,
it
is
the
drip
loss,
which
is
occurring,
right.
Then,
we
come
to
fatty
fish,
of
course,
fatty
fish
and
lean
fish.
Fatty
are
those,
which
are
having
high
fat
content,
around
say ,
20%
and
lean
fish
is
around,
maybe
2%
percent,
right.
So,
lean
fish,
haddock
and
catfish,
is
known
as
lean
fish,
right
and
fatty
fish,
we
know ,
many ,
for
example,
now
a
days
it
is
plenty
available,
that
is
hilsha,
and
many
others,
right.
Then,
freezer
burn,
which
is
very
important,
subsequently
also
we
will
see
that
freezer
burn.
This
describes
the
area
of
a
frozen
product,
in
which,
the
ice
has
sublimed,
leaving
the
product
dehydrated,
and
spongy ,
rather
dehydrated,
rather
porous,
the
process,
sorry ,
porous,
and
spongy .
The
phenomena
can
af fect
the
entire
surface
and
penetrate
deeply
into
the
product.
In
this
regard,
let
me
tell
you,
I
do
not
know ,
whether
you
have
done
mass
transfer ,
and
in
mass
transfer ,
there
is
a
mass
transfer
dif fusion
coef ficient.
In
its
determination,
there
is
one
experiment,
right,
in
which,
say
you
have
tube,
and
you
have
some
colored
solution,
right,
and
there
is
a
travelling
microscope,
there
is
a
travelling
microscope,
which
can
see
the
level,
right,
and
with
the
help
of
a
fan,
you
are
blowing
air ,
right.
So,
with
time,
what
will
happen?
This
layer
will
gradually
come
down,
like
this,
then
like
this.
So,
from
this
change
in
the
height,
you
can
determine,
the
dif fusion
coef ficient,
but
this
is
not
part
of
it,
but,
I
have
given
this
example,
because,
just
to
know
that
you
are
blowing
some
air .
In
freezer
burn,
it
is
also
happening
with
the
blast
of
air .
So,
what
is
happening,
your
frozen
material
is
this,
right,
you
are
blasting
some
air
for
cooling.
W ith
low
air
temperature,
you
are
freezing
or
chilling
or
whatever ,
you
are
doing,
and
there
is
a
blast
of
chilled
air
or
low
temperature
air .
So,
what
will
happen?
Gradually ,
the
moisturewill
migrate
to
this
and
the
moment
it
comes
to
the
surface,
because,
as
we
have
seen
there,
it
was
this,
you
know ,
and
this
vapors
are
formed
here,
and
you
are
blasting
it
away ,
so,
there
is
no
water
vapour
here,
right,
and
that
way ,
this
is
coming
down,
this
was
our
that
experiment
for
dif fusion
coef ficient
measurement,
but,
here
also
your
material
is
frozen,
you
are
blasting
with
air .
So,
the
moment
some
air
is
blown,
some
water
molecules
are
there,
that
is
blasted
of f.
The
vapour
of
the
water
molecule
is
blasted
of f.
So,
there
is
a
continuous
concentration
dif ference
between
the
air
molecule,
sorry ,
between
the
water
sublimed,
or
water ,
which
is
on
the
surface,
and
from
the
interior .
So
from
interior
water
is
coming
out,
and
after
sometime,
it
appears,
that
this
surface
is
very
very
dry ,
right.
I
don't
know ,
you
have
seen
burning
with
the
heat,
right.
So,
there
is
a,
maybe,
this
kind
of
boil,
on
the,
wherever
you
are
getting,
that,
whosoever
is
getting
that
burn,
right.
So,
it
gets
some
boil
like
this,
but
if
you
have
ever
come
across
with
freezer
burn,
that
is
with
low
temperature
burning,
then
you
will
not
see
that
kind
of
elevated
boil
kind
of
thing.
So,
there
the
surface,
where
it
is
getting
burn,
that
will
become
very
very
dry ,
right,
and
this
is
called
freezer
burn.
I
got
one,
while
I
was
working
with
liquid
nitrogen,
and
yes,
there
was
a
burning
on
the
hand,
and
when
I
went
to
the
doctor ,
said
nothing
can
be
done,
you
have
to
just
wait,
naturally
it
will
be
taken
care
of.
However ,
it
was
like
that
and
it
happened
also
naturally .
So,
this
is
freezer
burn,
and
freezer
burn
is
not
acceptable
by
the
consumer .
So,
if
you
come
across
with
a
freezer
burn
material,
you
will
like
to
discard
that,
right.
So,
some
more
definitions,
we
would
like
to
have
like
gaping,
right.
So,
gaping
is
another ,
which
is
exhibited
by
the
cut
surface
of
uncooked
fillet,
in
which
the
connective
tissues
fails
to
hold
the
muscle
block
together .
The
surface
presents
a
split,
or
cracked
appearance,
and
in
severe
cases,
the
fillet
will
disintegrate,
if
skinned,
right.
So,
this
is
one.
Then,
another
thing
very
important
is
called
tempering,
right.
I
hope,
you
are
little
kid,
may
not
be
little,
may
not
sorry ,
may
not
be
kid,
but
yes,
little
aged.
So,
maybe
senior
people
are
also
there.
So,
for
everybody ,
when,
at
our
home,
we
do
some
or
other
kind
of
thing,
our
parents
used
to
scold
us.
This
is
true
for
everybody ,
right
and
may
not
be
at
that
time,
but
after
sometime,
the
same
parents,
may
be
showing
their
af fection
to
you
in
some
or
other
way ,
right.
So,
that
means,
sometimes
it
is
giving
you
scolding,
and
sometimes,
they
are
giving
you
the
af fection
and
other
things.
So,
these
two
are
opposite
in
nature,
and
you
are
gradually
getting
tempered,
right.
So,
you
are
getting
both
hot
and
cold,
and
by
that
you
are
becoming
tempered.
Same
is
happening
everywhere,
that
rising
the
temperature
of
the
frozen
fish
or
product,
betweenminus
5
and
minus
10
degree
centigrade,
to
permit
mechanical
processes,
such
as
slicing
etc.
this
tempering
is
done,
right.
If
you
are
from
agricultural
background,
or
even
mechanical
also,
chemical
also,
may
be
that
the
bullock
cart,
right
that
bullock
cart
is
made
of
maybe
metal
or
wood
or
whatever ,
it
has
one
rubber
covering
right.
How
that
rubber
covering
is
made
done,
you
have
any
idea?
It
is
done,
say
you
have
the
wheel,
the
wheel
temperature
is
lowered,
the
wheel
and
the
rubber ,
that
like
tire,
similar
to
rubber
tire,
that
is
to
be
fitted.
So,
what
is
done,
that
wheel
is
lowered
with
its
temperature.
The
moment
you
are
lowering
the
temperature,
by
nature
more
or
less,
all
materials,
while
cooling,
or
if
it
is
cooled,
it
contracts.
Whereas,
exceptions
were
very
few ,
whereby ,
lowering
it
expands,
right.
So,
by
lowering,
you
are
contracting
the
wheel,
and
when
it
got
contracted,
the
rubber ,
that
covering,
or
tyre
is
then
put
into
that,
and
then,
after
some
time,
when,
the
same
wheel
is
heated
up,
it
gets
expanded.
So,
the
thing
is
getting
very
tightly
fixed.
The
same
is
true
when
we
said,
the
other
day ,
about
the
fin,
right.
In
that
fin
also,
if
this
is
the
material,
so,
it
is
cooled,
and
the
thing
which
is
to
be
pulled
like
this,
whose
radius
or
diameter
is
same
as
this
material.
So,
the
cooling
of
this
is
reducing
the
size
or
diameter ,
and
then
you
are
putting
the
fin,
right.
Because,
your
objective
is
that,
all
the
points
of
this,
because
circle,
or
cylinder ,
they
are
of
point
contact,
so,
every
point
is
in
contact
with
the
material,
where
you
are
extending
the
area.
So,
that
is
how ,
it
is
done,
right,
and
this
is
how
we
know ,
it
is
called,
similar
to
tempering,
or
annealing
also
it
may
be
said.
Then
glazing,
again
it
is
another
very
very
important
thing,
but
important
why ,
because,
most
of
the
cases,
those,
who
are
fooling
people
during
the
business,
it
is
more
for
them,
and
for
our
knowledge,
right.
So,
you
went
to
buy ,
say
a
fish,
and
this
fish,
by
appearance,
you
are
finding
very
good.
Y ou
brought
it
back
to
home,
and
then
everything
got
warmed
up
and
you
saw
that
this
is
not
a
good
fish,
right.
How
it
happened?
Suppose,
the
person,
who
is
doing
this
business,
he
purchased
that
fish,
right,
he
purchased
that
fish,
and
fish
of
poor
quality ,
then
he
frozen
it,
he
got
it
frozen.
So,
maybe
minus
18,
minus
20,
whatever
temperature,
right,
and
it
is
appearing
very
shabby
or
may
not
be
good.
So,
what
he
is
doing?
He
has
taken
some
water ,
or
some
similar ,
water
may
be
cold,
and
dipped
this
fish
into
that,
right
and
taken
out.
So,
there
will
be
a
fine
layer
of
water ,
and
because
the
fish
was
frozen,
and
you
have
put
a
fresh
water
liquid,
which
is
having
a
very
slight
or
very
mild
thickness
of
water .
So,
that
gets
frozen,
and
you
know
ice
is
a
very
good
reflecting
medium,
and
that
is
why ,
when
you
go
to
high
altitude,
you
are
asked
to
put
your ,
I
mean,
spectacles,
I
mean,
the
other
thing,
right.
So,
goggles
rather ,
so
typically
you
have
to
take
care
of
your
eye,because,
the
ice
is
reflecting
the
light
severely .
So
here
also,
that
glazed,
and
this
is
called
glazing,
that
glazed
material
is
reflecting
a
light
and
it
is
appearing
very
nice
right.
So
that
glaze
material
is
sold,
so
you
are
fooled.
So
this
is
for
typically ,
for
the
people
who
do
business,
or
fooling
the
other
one,
right.
So,
perhaps,
our
time
is
over ,
for
today's
this
class,
and
we
could
not
have
finished
the
freezing
part.
W e
will
do
it
in
the
next
class.
So
thank
you
for
listening.
