Cooling Load Calculation Contd.
Good
afternoon,
we
are
on
cooling
load
calculation
right.
So,
this
is
the
8th
class
on
total
of
course.
Now
this
is
we
are
continuing
cooling
load
and
perhaps
these
we
have
already
done,
this
also
in
the
last
class
we
have
done,
we
have
also
done
this
in
the
previous
class
ok.
Now ,
we
have
said
that
it
was
all
in
series
right,
but
there
can
be
different
situations
some
may
be
in
series,
some
may
be
parallel
or
all
may
be
parallel,
all
may
be
series.
So,
it
is
a
different
situation
depending
on
how
your
heat
is
getting
transferred
right.  This is we teach more in heat transfer , but since it is also coming here.
So,
I
just
said
that
I
will
give
you
some
idea
so
that
it
does
not
become
Greek
to
you
as
you
can
see
here
we
are
in
we
are
in
a
situation
where
we
have
this
side
is
insulated,
this
side
is
insulated
and
it
is
a
one
dimensional
heat
transfer
right.
If
it
is
one
dimensional
heat
transfer
in
this
side
is
at
a
temperature
T
1,
this
side
is
at
a
temperature
of
T
2
right
and
we
have
two
such
media
where
the
areas
are
different,
this
is
area
1,
this
is
area
2
and
the
conductivities
are
also
different,
this
is
k
1
and
this
is
k
2.
So,
what
is
happening,
this
Q
quantity
of
heat
that,
when,
is
coming
here,
is
getting
shared,
this
is
called
parallel.
So,
some
part
is
going
through
this,
some
part
is
going
through
this
right,
but
again
when
they
are
coming
out,
they
are
coming
as
Q
because,
Q
cannot
be
created
cannot be destroyed.So,
whatever
you
have
given
Q,
that
has
to
come
out,
in
the
steady
state,
of
course.
So,this
becomes
a
case
of
parallel.
So,
that
is
what
we
have
given
here,
Q
right
and
the
sameQ
is
coming
out
we
have
temperature
driving
force,
T
1
and
T
2
and
the
resistance
1
is
R1,
that
is
L
by
A
1
k
1
another
R
2
that
is
L
by
A
2
k
2.
So,
like
the
parallel
resistances,
we
have
done
earlier ,
in
our
earlier
classes,
not
this
class,
earlier
academic
classes,
under
graduate,
post
graduate,
wherever
it
is.
So,
this
we
are,
we
know
1
by
R
is
equal  to 1 by R 1 plus 1 by R 2 right.
So,
this
way
we
can
find
out,
what
is
the
resultant
R
right.
So,
what
we
need,
we
need
to
find
out
the
resistances
and
those
resistances
are
maybe
in
parallel
or
maybe
in
series
or
in
combination
of
parallel
and
series.
So,
depending
on
that
we
are
able
to
find
out
what
is
the
resultant
resistance
of
the
flow
of
heat
Q
right.
So,
this
we
are
able
to
find
out
in
this
case,
this
was
2
parallel
in
earlier
it
was
3
series.
So,
like
that
if
we
look
at
like
that,
if we look at this was our ,  we do not need this, ok.
Q
was
equivalent
to
Q
T
A
minus
T
B
R
where
R
is
as
we
said
1
by
R
is
equal
to
1
by
R
1
plus
1
by
R
2
and
that
is
equals
to
A
k
1
by
L,
since
the
length
was
same.
If
you
remember
the
length
was
same,
1
second,
if
you
remember ,
the
length
was
same
and
yeah,
here
as
you
see,
the
length,
it
was
same
for
both
the
cases.
Now ,
we
have
come
that
this
is
equal
to
A
2
k
2
by
L.
So,
we
find
out
R
from
here,
right
once
we
find
out
R
from
here,
Q
is
known
or
we
can
find
out
Q
depending
on
T
A
minus
T
B,
then
the
question
remain
that
we
said
that
resultant
k,
right.
The
resultant
k
we
can
find
out
from
here
that
is your Q is known delta T is known you have found out L, R.
So,
from
that
R
you
are
able
to
find
out
the
resultant
equivalent
k
right.
So,
once
you
find
out
equivalent
k
then
you
are
able
to
find
out
what
is
the
load,
cooling
load
for
that
insulation
or
the
container
or
the
room
right.
Then
we
move
to,
this
is
another
case,
this
is
another
case,
that
is
as
we
said
in
combination,
in
combination
means
you
have
you
have
this
one
the
Q
is
coming
through
this,
then
it
is
divided
into
3,
one
this,
one
this,
and
one
this,
then
again
going
it
to
one
only
this,
finally ,
going
out
to
T
2.
So,
driving
force
is
T
1
and
T
2
and
of
course,
the
other
sides
are
insulated.
This
is
only
one
dimensional right.
So,
this
is
only
one
dimensional,
others
are
getting
insulated
ok.
Like
this
we
can
find
out
that
what
is
the
Q
and
then
we
find
out
the
equivalent
conductivity .
So,
in
this
we
have
then
shown
really
you,
either
all
series
or
all
parallel
or
a
combination
of
series
and
parallel.
All
3
cases
we
have
shown
you,
which
are
probable
and
you
can
find
out
the
resistance
from
where
you
can
find
out
the
equivalent
conductivity .
Now ,
once
we
know
that our next performance is, let me also clear it up.
Next
performance
is
that
heat
in
leak
through
cracks
and
crevices
right
heat
in
leak
through
cracks
and
crevices.
So,
what
is
that?
As
I
said
earlier
that
every
building
may
have,
it
is
not
necessarily
it
will
always
have,
may
have
some
cracks
or
crevices
and
through
them
like
cracks
and
crevices,
if
we
draw ,
you
will
see
that,
say
this
is
the
wall,
right
wall
thickness,
there
may
be
a
slight
crack
like
this.
Now ,
if
you
have
this
kind
of
crack
what
will
happen?
This
outside
is
34
degree
or
say
40
degree
and
this
inside
is
say
minus
10
degree
say.
So,
your
delta
T
is
so
high
as
50
degree.
So,
what
will
happen?
The
air from outside  that will get into it through the crack very easily .
So,
you
are
making
a
thoroughfare
if
you
are
having
a
crack
in
the
building
or
in
the
container ,
where
you
are
doing
it
right.
So,
that
you
have
to
be
very
careful
while
calculating
whether
any
such
unit
is
there
or
not.
If
it
is,
you
have
to
take
care.
So,
the
majority
of
the
heat
is
transferred
due
to
the
fluctuations
in
pressure
caused
by
the
fluctuation
in
temperature
in
the
enclosure.
At
the
high
temperature
point
in
the
temperature
cycle,
cold
air
will
be
expelled
out
from
the
room
and
at
the
lowtemperature
rather
point
where
the
pressure
drops
warm
air
will
be
drawn
from
outside
into the room.
This
is
what
if
you
have
cracks
and
crevices.
Now
heat
leak
through
the
doors,
open
doors.
This
is
another
typical
one.
I
gave
you
the
example
of
household
refrigerator ,
this
is what exactly one household refrigerator . I  am showing you.
You
see,
the
door
is
so
much,
right
the
door
is
so
much,
and
if
you
open
the
door,
the
entire
bulk
air
gets
into
the
freeze.
Outside
may
not
be
as
high
as
outside
of
your
building,
but
still
in
the
summer
it
is
around
35.
So,
the
35
and
inside
is
around
4
degree.
So,
that
35
air
is
refreshing
inside
4
degree.
So,
the
compressor
has
to
work
again
very
high.
So
that,
this
fresh
air
is
cooled
to
4
degree.
So,
it
is
an
additional
load
for
the
compressor ,
that
is
why
you
should
tell
your
seniors
or
parents
or
who
are
handling
the
refrigerator ,
that
please
do
not
keep
the
door
open,
whatever
you
need
to
take,
you
take
it
out,
close
the
door
and
whatever
you
do
that
take
the
entire
or
part
of
it
and
put
it
back,
open
the
door
and
put
it
and
again
close
the
door.
Keep
the
door
closed
as
much
as
possible
that
will
minimize
the
heat
load.
So,
this
is
true
everywhere
in
the
small
scale
with
this
we
are
showing
right
in
the
larger
scale
the
doors
are
even
much
bigger
in
the
cold
rooms,
the
doors
are
very
very
big
because
lot
many
people
get
into
it
with
the
product  for keeping as well as for taking out. So, there, the doors are supposed to be big.
So,
lot
of
fresh
air
getting
in
when
we
will
come
to
cold
store
you
will
see
that
such
big
big
doors
are
there
and
big
big
buildings
are
also
there
and
you
are
doing
what?
Unnecessarily
keeping
the
door
open,
allowing
fresh
hot
air
to
get
in
and
get
it
absolutely
warm
up
which
is
not
required.
So,
opening
doors
each
time
allow
entry
of
warm
air
and
exit
of
cold
air.
The
rate
at
which
heat
is
incurred
that
depends
primarily
on
the
following
aspects
number
1
size
of
the
door,
number
2
temperature
differential
between
the
inside
and
outside
right.
As
I
said
35,
if
it
is,
no,
maybe
in
winter
it
is
25.
So,
delta
T
is
less
there
delta
T
was
more,
size
of
the
door
normal
household
doors
are
7
feet
wide
and
large,
but
cold
room
doors
are
much
more
than
that,
maybe
around
10
12
around 10 feet and the width is also  maybe 8 to 10 feet.
So,
that
is
a
huge
one
because
the
people,
they
will
take
on
their
head
this
bags
full
of
the
produce
and
either
store
or
take
out
the
bags
with
their,
I
mean
on
their
head,
that
is
how
in
India,
as
of
now
is,
because,
very
very
rarely
things
are
automatic
very
rarely .
So,
if
it
is
automatic
then
lot
of
problems
are
solved,
because
you
do
not
have
to
keep
the
door
open,
you
can
put
it
or
dump
it
with
automatically
and
unload
it
also
automaticallysome
conveyor
belt
will
be
there.
So,
they
will
convey
and
there
will
be
people
who
will
be
taking
out
and
put
it
in
the
right
place
right.
So,
door
size
and
the
temperature
differential,
these
two
are
absolutely
fundamental
for
the
heat
leak
through
the
doors
right. For example,  we can do a problem.
So,
this
is
an
empirical
relation
to
determine
the
rate
of
heat
transfer
through
doors
of
refrigerated
rooms
that
is
between
22.2
and
66.7
degree
centigrade
and
the
relation
is
Q
is
equal
to
2126
W
e
to
the
power
0.0484
into
delta
T
into
h
to
the
power
1.71.
I
repeat
that
Q
quantity
of
heat,
this
Q
is
rate
of
heat
in
leak
that
is
in
watt
joules
per
second
right
because
any
rate
means
per
unit
time
whatever
it
be
any
rate
is
per
unit
time
that
is
how
velocity
is
also
meter
per
second.
So,
like
that
so,
Q
is
the
rate
of
heat
transfer
in
leak
in
watt
2126
is
a
constant
W
is
the
width
of
the
door
in
meter
delta
T
is
the
temperature
difference
in
degree
centigrade
between
inside
and
outside
the
room
and
h
is
the
height
of
the
door
right.
The
moment
you
are
seeing
2
that
means,
you
know
the
area
and
area
means
it
is
the,
that
Q
is
equal
to
U
A
delta
T,
that
A
is
known
right.
So,
by
this
we
can
find
out
if
this
is
a
correlation
between
the
heat
transfer
rate
in
the
doors
where
the
size
of
the
doors
and
the
temperature
difference
between
them
is
between
22
to
66
degree
centigrade
right.
So,
likewise
this
is
a
semi
empirical
relation
right
maybe
some
empirical relations or experimental  relations also can be developed.
In
this,
I
refer
to
you
one
very
very
important
book
that
is
called
ASHRAE
right.
This
ASHRAE
handbook
if
you
look
at
all
this
you
will
get
it
all
this
you
will
get
it
because
this
is
perhaps
American
society
for
heating
and
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
engineering
or
something
like
that
whatever
it
be
you
get
lot
of
relations
lot
of
information
in
that.
So,
that
is
very
very
useful.
So,
what
we
now
can
do
is
that
solving
a
problem
and
showing
that
how
much
really
heat
is
getting
into
when
the
doors
are
getting
opened.
For
example,
a
3
meter
high
and
2
meter
width
refrigerated
room
is
opened and closed 10 times in every hour and each time it remains  open for 1 minute.
The
refrigerated
load
in
a
day
due
to
the
door
opening,
if
the
room
and
the
ambient
temperature
is
maintained
at
0
degree
centigrade
and
30
degree
centigrade
respectively ,
in
mega
joules
right.
And
you
have
to
find
out
which
one
is
correct
A
2000
mega
joules
B
1801
mega
joules
C
1711
mega
joules
or
D
2052
mega
joules
right.
So,
this
you
can
do
of
course,
I
have
done
it
for
you,
but
you
can
also
do
to
understand.
Let
me
tell
the
problem
again
that
a
3
meter
high
and
2
meter
width,
you
see,
3
meter
high.
That
means,
it is almost 10 feet and or beyond 10 feet and 2 meter width means almost 6 7  feet.
So,
it
is
a
wide
refrigerated
room,
is
opened
and
closed
10
times
in
every
hour
and
each
time
it
remains
open
for
1
minute.
The
refrigeration
load
in
a
day
due
to
the
dooropening,
if
the
room
and
the
ambient
temperature
is
maintained
at
0
degree
centigrade
and
30
degree
centigrade
respectively ,
and
you
find
out
in
terms
of
mega
joule
and
tell
which
one
is
correct
whether
A,
2000
mega
joules,
B,
1801
mega
joules,
C,
1711
mega
joules,
or
D,
2052
mega
joules
right.
Now ,
our
given
things
are
3
meter
and
2
meter
right.
So,
h
is
3
meter
and
w
is
2
meter .
Also
you
are
given
delta
T
of
30
minus
0
that
is
30 degree centigrade.
Therefore,
from
the
previous
relation,
if
you
remember
the
heat
in
leak
rate
can
be
found
out
from
the
relation
q
is
equal
to
2126
into,
it
was
having
2126,
if
we
go
back
here,
it
was
2126
into
w,
w
is
the
width
of
the
door
into
e
to
the
power
0.0484
into
delta
T
into
h
to
the
power
1.71
h,
h
is
the
height,
w
is
the
width
and
h
is
the
height.
So,
here
we are writing that q is 2126 into  2 that was width, here it is 2 meter .
So,
2
into
e
to
the
power
0.0484
into
delta
T
that
is
30,
into
h
to
the
power
1.71,
h
is
3.
So,
3
to
the
power
1.71
and
if
we
calculate
it
it
comes
1188.7
kilowatt,
but
we
are
asked
to find out what is the heat in leak if 10  times an hour , it is opened.
So,
the
door
was
opened
for
a
total
time
of
240
minute,
because
24
hour
a
day.
So,
24
into
10
is
240
minute,
the
door
was
opened
in
a
day
and
this
means
it
is
1.44
into
104
seconds
right.
So,
the
refrigeration
load
we
can
find
out
that
kilowatt
right,
times
the
second
is
mega
joule
and
that
is
coming
1711
that
is
c)
is
the
correct
answer
right.
So,
this
way
if
we
do
some
more
problems,
we
can
come
to
know
what
is
the
real
heat
load
due
to
the
door
opening,
coming
and
it
is
a
huge
quantity
as
you
see
that
1711
mega
joules right.
Given, h = 3m, W = 2m, ∆T = 30
o
C,
q = 2126 [2] [e]
0.0484
(30) [3]
1.71
= 1188.7 kW
The door was opened for a total time of 240 min
= 1.44 X 104 secs.
Refrigeration load in a day = 171 1 MJ
So,
it
is
a
huge
quantity
is
equal
to
1711
into
10
to
the
power
3
kilo
joules
right
or
1711
into
10
to
the
power
6
joules.
So,
much
of
heat
load
which
is
coming
ok.
So,
next
day
we
will
do
some
other ,
maybe
some
calculations,
are
not
over
because
it
is
so
big
and
so
fundamental that unless you  know it, you are not able to find out, ok. Thank you.
