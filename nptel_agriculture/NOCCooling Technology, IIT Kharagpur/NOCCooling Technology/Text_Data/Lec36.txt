Gas as Refrigerant
Good
morning,
my
dear
friends
and
dear
students.
Students
are
the
dearest
of
all
teachers,
there
is
no
ambiguity
irrespective
of
teacher ,
students
are
dearest
to
them.
Because,
teachers
do
love
to
communicate
to
the
students,
not
only
that
they
want
to
impart
some
knowledge,
whatever
the
teacher
is
having,
right.
So,
though
I
tell
in
every
class,
in
the
beginning,
that
good
morning
and
good
afternoon
dear
students,
really
I
love
my
dear
students,
not
only
I
love
my
dear
students,
I
also
get
love
from
my
students,
all
over
the
world.
You
see,
in
every
occasion,
they
do
write
to
me,
they
do
wish
to
me,
etc,
right.  So, I am very happy that I am coming in across with you.
So,
before
I
start,
because
after
some
days
the
classes,
will
be
over,
and
then
your
exam
will
come
someday ,
and
the
way
you
are
seeing
that
these
cycles
are
so
big
that
if
I
give
questions
which
are
subjective,
then
what
will
happen?
Because
these
questions
are
checked
by
computer ,
no
manual
checking.
So,
computer
will
check
based
on
what
information
I
have
given.
Now ,
the
same
thing
you
might
have
said,
the
Carnot
cycle
in
your
words
and
I
have
said
the
same
Carnot
cycle
in
my
words.
So,
there
will
be
a
mismatch.
So,
computer
will
take
your
thing
0,
to
avoid
that
our
parent
concern,
that
is
NPTEL,
they
have
devised
such
a
beautiful,
because
over
the
years,
I
have
been
taking
many
many
courses.
So,
they
have
made
such
a
beautiful
technique,
that
it
should
be
objective
type,
right.
So
that,
there
is
no
ambiguity .
It
is
unambiguous.
So,
that
is
why,
it
may
not
be
possible
for
me
to
make
questions,
out
of
cycles,
itself,
but,
it
does
not
mean
that
from
the cycle, or cycles, some internal things, I cannot ask, that  I may .
So,
it
is
very
much
required
that,
you
go
through
carefully ,
otherwise
you
may
miss
which
I
do
not
like,
I
wish
all
of
you
get
100
out
of
100,
that
exactly
depends
on
how
you
are
preparing
yourself.
You
know ,
or
by
this
time,
that,
there
will
be
some
weekly
test,
or
weekly ,
some
assignments
given
to
you.
I
have
my
co
teacher
associate
or
assistant.
So,
they
will
look
into
them,
and
obviously ,
they,
whose
are
also
objective,
right.  So, if you go through carefully , you will be able to answer .
So,
my
request
to
all
of
you
that,
please
do
not
take
it
lightly .
If
you
are
really
interestedto
give
the
exam,
there
are
many
students,
who
appear ,
and
do
not
appear
in
the
exam,
but,
I
have
no
idea
why
it
is.
Is
it
only
for
some
1000
rupees
of
exam
charge.
It
should
not
be,
nowadays,
1000
rupees,
perhaps
has
no
value,
and
you
are
getting
a
certificate,
right
and
that
will
definitely
carry
throughout
your
life.
As
well
this
certificate,
whatever
the
equivalent
credit
course,
that
make,
be
relaxed
from
your
normal
credit
course.
If
you
are
studying
B.Tech,
M.Tech,
Ph.D,
whatever
right.
So,
this
is
my
request
to
you
all
friends
and
students
even
including
friends
those
who
are
senior ,
that,
please
go
through carefully , and these videos are open to you throughout  the day and night.
So
whenever ,
you
find
time,
you
can
go
through,
or
you
can
study ,
you
can
refer
some
books
also,
right,
though
I
have
not
given
any
reference
as
of
now.
Because,
perhaps
in
the
very
first
introduction,
I
have
already
said
something
please
go
through
that,
and
I
always
refer
my
teacher
who
is
no
more,
professor
R.C.
Aurora.
There
is
a
book
on
refrigeration by C.
P.
Aurora,
that
is
very
old
book,
right.
I
am
not
saying,
that
is
bad,
that
is
also
very
good
book,
but
very
old
problems
are
less
etc.
Professor
R.C.
Aurora,
so
this
thick,
the
book,
and it is also nice.
Unfortunately ,
perhaps,
before
editing
it,
completely
he
expired,
and
really ,
I
mean,
my
greatest
gratitude
to
him
because,
he
was
my
teacher ,
right.
However ,
now
let
us
come
to
the
subject.
We
have
covered
Carnot
cycles.
We
have
covered
in
the
last
class
also
if
the
substance
is
a
pure
substance
right.
Now ,
we
will
switch
over
to
gas
as
refrigerant,
right.
So,
gradually ,
we
are
coming
to
the
natural
situation,
from
ideal
to
the
actual
situation,
we
are
coming
up.
So,
obviously ,
there
will
be
some
or
other
changes,
so
those
will
be
definitely
covered
during
the
course,
right.
So,
gas
as
refrigerant.
If
we
look
at
that,
this
is
what,
that
gas
as
refrigerant,
and
if
you
remember
that,
Carnot,
which
we
had
already
said,
many
many
times,
right
and
this
we
call
reverse
Carnot
cycle,
right.
So,
the
arrows
are reversed than that of the Carnot refrigeration cycle.
This
you
can
confirm
from
the
figures,
which
is
before
you,
that
figure
A
is
the
actual
and
figure
B
is
the
that
of
the
Carnot.
So,
Wc
work
is
done
on
the
system,
Qc
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
system,
Wt
quantity
of
work
done
by
the
system,
and
QL
quantity
of,
that
was
QH
quantity ,
which
was
coming
and
QL
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected.
This
was
the
reverse
Carnot
cycle,
right
as
it
is
shown
in
the
earlier
cases
also.
But,
here
what
we
are
doing?
In
the
actual
case,
there
is
reversal
of
the
Carnot
is,
W
C
quantity
ofwork
is
done
on
the
system,
the
QH
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
as
from
that
condenser
then perhaps, again this is a cut, and paste. So, this is an error .
So,
it
should
be
this,
W
T
quantity
of
work
done
by
the
system,
for
which
QLquantity
of
heat
is
introduced
into
the
system
from
the
evaporator ,
right.
So,
this
is
the
difference
between
the
Carnot
and
rest
of
the
Carnot.
If
we
analyze
this,
then
what
we
get?
This
is
the
reason,
as
we
said,
why
the
cycles
are
called
reversed
Carnot
cycle.
So,
and
in
both
the
cycles,
the
temperature
to
which
heat
is
rejected
is
of
course,
the
same,
because
there
was
also
QH
and
QL,
here
is
also
QH
and
QLand
the
temperature
was
TH
and
TL,
here
also TH and TL, right.  However this cycle consists of the following reversible processes.
Reversible
processes
are:
like
this,
that
step
1
to
2,
right
step
1
to
2,
I
go
back
to
the
original
figure,
so
that
it
becomes
easy
for
you,
that,
this
was,
so
step
1
to
2,
we
mean
this
step,
right.
So,
1
to
2
is
that,
or
what
I
can
do,
this
is
the
reversal,
not
that,
mind
it,
this
way,
ok.
So,
there,
we
can
say,
we
can
say,
that,this
is
a,
this
is
an
isentropic
input,
WC
in
a
compressor
right,
isentropic
input
in
a
WC
as
WC
in
a
compressor ,
right.
So,
instead
of
going
to
and
fro,
again,
as
in
the
previous
classes,
I
had
shown
you
that,
we
have
this
dome,
right
and
in
this
case,
it
is
also
reversible,
but
one
thing,
let
me
check
that,
yes,
it
is
that,
this
is
the
1,
oh,
oh,
this
is
the
1,
this
is
the
2,
this
is
the
3,
and
this
is
the
4.
So,
WC
work
is
done
on
the
compressor ,
1,
2,
3,
4,
WC
work
is
done
on
the
compressor isentropically ,  because, entropy is constant, this is the entropy .
So,
it
is
isentropically ,
WC
quantity
of
work
is
given,
as
input
to
the
compressor .
Then,
step
2
to
3
is
isothermal
heat
rejection,
that
is
QH
to
a
heat
sink.
So,
from
here
QH
quantity
of
heat
is
given
to
the
heat
sink
and
finally ,
it
will
come,
QL
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
system,
right.
Therefore,
we
are,
we
are
giving
away
QH
quantity
of
heat
to
the
surrounding
through
condenser ,
right,
and
that
is
the
heat
rejected
at
the
temperature constant, because it is isothermal.  So, at the temperature TH, it is rejected.
Then,
step
3
to
4
is
again,
an
isentropic
work
output
WT,
right.
So,
WT,
this
is
done
by
the
turbine,
right.
It
is
done
by
the
turbine,
it
is
work
output,
that
is
the
work
done
by
the
compressor ,
or
turbine,
in
this
case,
right.
And
the
fourth
case
is
step
4
to
1,
that
is,
isothermal
heat
absorption
QL
at
temperature
TL,
TL
temperature,
QL
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
system,
right.
Then,
we
have
summarized
it,
and
the
theorems
are
similar
to
the
Carnot
theorem
and
these
are:
no
refrigeration
system
can
have
a
COP
greater
than
that
for
a
reversible
cycle
working
between
the
same
two
temperature
reservoirs
or
sink
and reservoir .
So,
it
is
TH
and
TL.
Then,
all
reversible
cycles
operating
between
the
same
two
temperatures
of
receiver
and
sink
have
the
same
COP.
This
also,
we
have
proved
earlier ,right.
All
reversible
cycles
operating
between
the
same
two
temperatures
of
receiver
and
the
sink
have
the
same
COP.
This
also,we
have
done
explicitly
earlier ,
right.
Now ,
the
other
way
we
can
say,
the
COP
of
reversible
cycle
is
independent
of
the
working
substance.
This
also
we
have
said,
and
proved
earlier
right.
So,
this
is
already
established.
Now ,
using
the
first
and
second
law
of
thermodynamics
in
this,
these
theorems
can
easily
be
proved
as
like
this.
So,
let
us
consider
the
figure,
as
shown
below
and
the
figure
is
this.
We have one refrigerator , and we are having rather .
QH
as
the
heat
source,
QL
as
the
cold
refrigerator .
So,
as
you
see
from
here
that,
QL
is
the
cold
refrigerated
space
at
low
temperature
TL,
and
QH
is
the
one
environment
at
temperature
TH,
right
and
W
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
system,
right.
So
this
we
can
say,
a
refrigerator
removing
heat,
QL
from
a
cold
space.
So,
we
can
write,
from
this
figure
that,
W
is
equal
to
QH
minus
QL,
which
is,
earlier
also,
from
the
first
law,
we
have
seen.
The
Clausius
inequality
from
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics,
that
states
that,
integral
of
cyclic
process,
integral
under
cyclic
process
of
dQ
over
T
is
always
less
than or equal  to 0.
This
was
Clausius
inequality
statement.
In
thermodynamics,
we
had
said
this,
right.
We
had
established
also
that,
this
integral
of
cyclic
process
dQ
over
T
is
less
than
equal
to
0.
So,
if
that
be
true,
then
what
we
can
say
that,
the
cycle
or
cyclic
integral
is
0
for
the
reversible
cycle,
and
less
than
0
for
the
irreversible
cycle,
that
also
we
have
said
earlier ,
that
for
the
reversible
cycle,
for
a
cyclic
process,
the
integral
is
equal
to
0
that
is
dQ
over
T
is
equal
to
0,
and
dQ
reversible
over
T
is
0
and
it
is
less
than
0,
if
it
is
irreversible,
right.
So,
by
convention,
we
have
seen
that,
heat
transfer
to
the
system
is
considered
to
be
positive,
heat
transfer
to
the
system
is
considered
to
be
positive,
and
heat
transfer
from the  system is considered to be negative.
So,
this
means
Q
L
is
positive,
and
Q
H
is
negative.
If
you
remember
that,
sorry ,
if
you
remember
that,
our
system
was
this,
right.
Our
system
was
this,
and
Q
L
quantity
of
heat
was
subjected
to
this,
and
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected
right.
Since
Q
L
is
applied
to
the
system,
we
call
it
to
be
positive
and
Q
H
is
rejected
from
the
system,
is
negative
right.
So,
we
can
say
that,
Q
L
over
Q
H,
rather
Q
L
over
T
L,
is
minus
Q
H
over
T
H,
is
also
less
than
equal
to
0,
right,
is
also
equal
or,
less
than
equal
to
0,
and
hence,
from
the
above
relation
we
can
write
that,
Q
L
over
T
L
minus
Q
L
plus
W
over
T
H
because,
Q
H
we have already shown.
If
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
equation,
we
had
shown
that,
here
that,
W
is
Q
L
sorry
W
is
Q
L,
Q
H
minus
Q
L
right.
So,
this
already
we
have
done.
So,
we
can
say
that,
wecan
say
that
Q
L
over
T
L
minus,
now
instead
of
that
Q
H,
we
are
writing,
Q
L
plus
W,
right
over
T
H,
and
this
is
also
less
than
equal
to
0
right.This
is
also
less
than
equal
to
0.
So,
we
can
say
that,
Q
L
into
T
H
minus
T
L
over
T
H,
T
L
minus
W
into
minus
W
over
T H  is also less than equal to 0.
So,
from
here
we
can
say
that,
the
COP
is,
as
defined
that,
Q
L
over
W,
you
remember ,
I
said,
how
many
paddy
how
many
rice,
that
is
the
COP,
or
efficiency ,
from
how
many
paddy
how
many
rice
you
are
getting.
So,
that
is
the
COP,
that
is
the
efficiency ,
in
every
step
of
life,
here
also
how
much
work
you
have
given
as
input
and
how
much
refrigeration
effect
Q
L
you
have
received,
this
ratio
is
the
COP.
So,
this
is
also
less
than
equal
to
T
L
over
T
H
minus
T
L
right.
So,
from
that
we
can
say
that,
this
relation
states
that
the
COP
of
reversible
cycle
is
the
maximum,
because,
irreversible
is
less
than
0.
So
the
COP,
for
the
reversible
cycle
is
the
maximum,
and
the
proof
of
the
first
theorem
is
this,
that
the
COP
is
maximum
for
the
reversible
cycle
for
irreversible
it
is
less
than
that
right.
So,
that
we
have
already
showed
here,
that
is
less
than
equal
to
0.
This
is
also
less
than
equal
to
0.
So,
that
equal
to
is
for
reversible,
and
less
than
0
is
for
irreversible,
right.
So,
our today's time is up so we will meet again in the next class.  Thank you.
