Why
Cooling
is
r equir ed?
Good
morning.
In
the
previous
class,
we
had
tried
to
make
you
understand
what
a
refrigerator
at
your
house
is
made
of,
right.
Obviously ,
it
is
obvious
that
the
refrigerator
you
bought
is
to
keep
the
materials,
may
be
either
freshly
prepared,
or
may
be
the
left
over
of
the
previous
lunch,
or
dinner
for
a
few
days
more.
So,
today's
class
we
would
like
to
highlight
on
why
cooling
is
required,
right.
As
of
now ,
no
system
has
been
developed
where
neither
heating
nor
cooling
is
required
to
keep
the
materials
and
they
will
be
kept
for
a
long
period.
As
of
now ,
through
science,
you
cannot
predict,
as
of
now ,
it
has
not
been
evolved.
In
future,
when
you
grow
up
to
our
age,
we
have
no
idea,
what
will
happen
during
that
time.
But,
as
of
today ,
yes,
there
is
no
substitute
of
either
heating
or
cooling,
right.
Heating
is
beyond
our
scope
because
we
are
dealing
with
the
cooling
not
the
heating,
but
it
is
not
that
only
cooling
can
do
everything,
it
is
also
not
that
only
heating
can
do
everything,
right.
In
many
cases,
it
may
be
a
combination,
I,
rather ,
in
most
of
the
cases,
it
may
be
a
combination.
Now
why
we
need
to
cool
because
we
want
to
preserve
it
for
a
longer
period.
Now ,
if
we
want
to
preserve
it
for
a
longer
period,
what
does
it
mean?
This
means
that
this
should
allow
the
destruction
of
microor ganisms
and
spores
or
it
should
be
inactivation
of
enzymes
or
it
could
be
slowing
the
rate
of
chemical
reactions
such
as
oxidation
and
other
things.
So,
if
that
be
true,
then
we
can
say
that
keeping
it
for
few
more
days
than
one
day
or
half
a
day
meaning
you
are
preserving
it
for
a
longer
period.
So,
if
you
are
preserving
it
for
a
longer
period,
how
you
are
doing?
Y ou
are
either
destroying
the
microor ganisms
or
spores,
though
this
is
not
the
class
of
microor ganism,
but
still
a
new
thing
has
come
up
like
the
word
spore
because
most
of
you
have
heard
the
name
of
microor ganism
or
word
microor ganism,
but
you
might
not
have
heard
spores.
Now
in
microor ganisms
there
are
vegetative
cells
and
there
are
spores.
V ibrative
cells
can
multiply
into
many
in
numbers,
but
normally
spores
they
are
resistantto
heat
because
any
microor ganism
that
can
be
killed
by
the
application
of
heat
only .
Nowadays,
many
other
things
have
come
up,
but
by
and
lar ge,
I
can
say
only
that,
heat
is
destroying
the
spores
and
the
vegetative
cells.
Now
these
microor ganisms
could
be
detrimental
or
could
be
it
is
not.
That
in
the
world
all
microor ganisms
are
not
bad.
There
are
many
or ganisms
which
are
good
and
when
you
are
heating
you
do
not
know
who
is
good
or
who
is
bad.
Heat
will
simply
kill
the
or ganisms
whichever
is
there
and
that
is
what
is
destruction
of
microor ganism
and
spores.
Y es,
spores,
what
I
was
saying
spores
means,
if
this
is
a
rod
shaped,
say
microor ganism
then
spore
means
that
all
around
of
it
there
will
be
some
coating
developed
by
the
or ganism
itself
and
that
protects
from
heat
or
normal
other
factors.
So
they
are
very
dif ficult
to
be
destroyed.
That
is
why
that
destruction
of
both
the
vegetative
and
spores
together
will
keep
the
material,
in
this
case
we
are
dealing
with
food,
right.
Please
mind
it,
we
are
dealing
with
food,
right
not
the
other
materials.
So
materials,
which
will
be
kept
for
a
longer
period,
they
will
be
having
the
or ganisms
and
spores
killed
or
it
may
be
required
because
we
are
talking
about
preservation.
So
it
may
be
required
to
inactivate
the
enzymes.
I
hope,
many
of
you
have
seen
in
your
house
that
there
are
guava
trees,
mostly
those
who
are
in
the
village
side
or
even
in
urban
areas
also
that
you
might
have
seen
the
guava
is
growing
in
the
tree,
right.
Some
way
of
bruising
happen
to
the
guava
and
you
will
see
the
enzymes
which
are
there
they
will
start
acting
on
the
guava
and
you
may
get
a
rotten
or
spoiled
guava
after
some
days.
This
may
be
because
of
the
enzymes
which
were
available
in
the
surface
of
the
guava.
Similarly ,
the
preservation
meaning,
it
is
slowing
down
the
chemical
reactions
and
chemical
reactions
meaning,
like
browning
reaction,
or
this
browning
could
be
oxidative
browning
or
enzymatic
browning.
For
example,
if
you
cut
an
apple
and
keep
it
for
longer
period
you
will
see
the
apple
colour
has
moved
from
its
original
colour
to
little
blackish
or
rather
blackish
or
many
part
of
it
is
becoming
black
or
blackish.
This
is
due
to
the
enzymatic
browning
of
the
cut
apple
when
we
cut
the
apple
as
we
said.
In
the
case
of
guava,
similarly ,
in
the
case
of
the
apple
also,
the
enzymes
act
on
the
guava
and
these
enzymes
do
act
on
the
cut
apple
and
destroy
the
apple
by
changing
its
colour
it
is
called
browning
reaction
or
enzymatic
browning
reaction.
Another
browning
is
also
there,
though
this
is
not
part
of
it,
but
still
you
should
know ,
that
the
sugar
and
amine
present
in
the
food
material,
they
do
also
act
or
react
that
is
called
chemical
browning
which
is
the
reaction
of
the
both
amine
or
amino
group
and
the
sugar
present
in
the
food
material
forming
this
brown
colour ,
brownation,
right.
So,
this
is
called
browning
reaction
and
this
kind
of
reaction
happens
in
most
of
the
food
material,
right.
So,
this
is
called
sugar
amine
reaction
or
may
the
product
which
isobtained
called
melanoidins.
Melanoidin
may
also
happen
in
browning
reaction.
So,
this
is
another
reason
why
or
what
we
mean
by
food
preservation.
Now ,
preservation
can
also
be
done
by
many
other
ways
like
or
it
may
be
required
for
other
safety
reasons
because
now-a-days,
it
is
also
a
more
or
less
slogan
that
safe
food,
right
safe
food
is
the
slogan
of
today .
So,
there,
that
means,
for
the
safety
reason
you
are
also
preserving
through
processing,
right,
through
processing
and
in
that
case
you
may
need
to
destroy
toxic
materials
or
toxins
or
improving
the
properties
like
physicochemical
sensory
or
aesthetic
properties
of
the
food
material
that
may
occur
due
to
processing
of
the
food
material.
Then
we
come
to
a
very
important
aspect,
that
is
called
temperature
quotient.
Now ,
temperature
quotient
is
a
very
important
parameter
in
the
sense
that
from
there
you
may
come
to
know
the
reactions
which
we
have
already
told
or
the
changes
which
are
associated
with
the
preservation
techniques.
The
temperature
coef ficient
or
Q
10
that
reflects
to
the
factor
by
which
the
rate
of
any
reaction
such
as
chemical,
biochemical,
enzymatic,
microbial
any
type
of
reactions
the
rate
of
which
increases
or
decreases
by
increasing
or
decreasing
10
degree,
right.
So,
this
is
a
typical
parameter
which
is
known
as
temperature
quotient
and
is
expressed
as
Q
10
is
equal
to
R
2
by
R
1
to
the
power
10
by
T
2
minus
T
1
right.
So,
temperature
quotient
can
be
said
as
Q
10
and
which
represents
a
factor
by
which
the
rate
of
a
reaction
increases
for
every
10
degree
rise
in
this
temperature
it
may
fall
also
if
we
decrease
the
temperature.
So,
if
we
see
what
are
the
individual
parameters
like
Q
10
is
the
factor
by
which
the
reaction
rate
increases
when
the
temperature
is
used
by
or
increased
by
10
degree
centigrade.
So,
Q
10
is
a
unit
less
quantity
if
you
are
asked
what
is
the
unit
of
Q
10
you
have
to
say ,
because
it
is
a
ratio.
So,
ratio
of
the
rates
of
reactions
so,
it
is
unit
less.
So,
if
you
remember ,
we
said
R
2
and
R
1
right.
So,
that
R
2
and
R
1
is
the
measured
reaction
rate
at
temperature
T
1
that
is
R
1
where
T
1
is
less
than
T
2,
note
that
R
1
and
R
2
must
have
the
same
unit
otherwise
it
cannot
be
unit
less.
Q
10
and
R
2
is
the
measured
reaction
rate
at
temperature
T
2
where
T
2
is
greater
than
T
1
and
here
also
you
have
to
note
that
R
1
and
R
2
must
have
the
same
units
otherwise
Q
10
cannot
be
a
unit
less
quantity .
So,
the
Q
10
is
the
temperature
at
which
the
reaction
rate
R
1
is
measured
where
of
course,
T
1
is
less
than
T
2
the
temperature
unit
must
be
either
in
Celsius
or
in
Kelvin
and
many
may
not
be
any
other
unit,
such
as
the
Fahrenheit.
Note
that
T
1
and
T
2
must
have
the
same
units
T
2
and
T
1
do
not
need
to
be
exactly
10
degree
apart
a
little
this
or
that
side
also
will
do
means
8
degree
or
9
degree
you
have
increased
you
cannot
increase
it
further
then
that
9
degree
also
will
happen
and
you
can
use
that.
So,
T
1
is
the
temperature
at
which
reaction
rate
R
1
is
measured
where
T
2
is
greater
than
T
1
and
the
temperature
unit
must
be
either
the
Celsius
or
Kelvin
and
may
not
be
any
other
unit
such
as
the
Fahrenheit.
ote
that
T
1
and
T
2
have
the
same
unit
and
T
1
and
T
2
need
to
be
exactly
10
degree
apart.
Now
typically
the
values
of
Q
10
are
available
which
is
from
the
literature
that
for
growth
of
or ganisms
it
can
be
1.5
right.
So,
their
Q
R
2
by
R
1
into
10
to
the
power
R
2
minus
R
1
10
to
the
power
R
2
no
10
by
2
to
the
power
10
by
T
2
minus
T
1
is
the
Q
10.
So,
if
you
know
R
1
and
R
2
for
Q
10
for
growth
it
comes
to
around
1.
5
it
is
a
ratio
and
Q
10
for
imbibition,
it
could
be
1.5
to
1.8
times
Q
10
for
photosynthesis
could
be
2.1
to
2.5
and
Q
10
for
respiration
could
be
2
and
3
or
between
2
and
3.
So,
this
is
typically
units
or
typically
the
numbers
which
are
used
for
Q
10
normally
that
may
vary
with
temperature
or
any
other
thing,
but
we
can
say
that
in
this
we
are
taking
a
typical
cycle
of
photosynthesis
right
and
you
know
during
photosynthesis
it
is
always
not
that
light
is
utilized
for
the
photosynthesis
and
there
is
nothing
else
that
is
also
not
true.
For
those
photosynthesis
where
light
is
utilized
normally
sunlight,
there
light
is
absorbed
by
chlorophyll
and
water
splits
or
rather
which
splits
with
water
and
we
get
ener gy
A TP
and
NADP
and
lastly
the
Calvin
cycle
or
carbon
dioxide
water
they
are
producing
lot
of
ener gy
where
carbon
dioxide
is
a
bypass
or
by
basic
fundamentals
of
silica
preparation
silica.
I
hope
you
understand,
but
this
is
called
daytime
respiration
of
mango.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
what
happens
during
the
night
time
because
night
time
there
is
no
sunlight.
So,
in
that
case
this
is
called
dark
reactions
and
chloroplast
with
the
help
of
ADP
and
NADP
is
using
Calvin
cycle
and
used
ener gy
to
recycle.
So,
one
is
with
the
help
of
sunlight
and
sunlight
is
producing
water
ener gy
and
carbon
dioxide
and
in
absence
of
sunlight
this
is
just
the
reverse
that
is
called
light
reaction
and
there
oxygen
and
dark
reactions
are
happening
along
with
C
6
H
12
O
6.
So,
in
the
dark
you
are
not
allowed
to
go
in
the
dark
you
are
not
allowed
to
go
outside
below
the
tree
that
is
what
the
senior
people
at
home
they
do
tell
that
you
cannot,
you
should
not
go
during
evening
time
below
the
big
trees
because
they
are
using
oxygen
and
in
and
they
are
using
oxygen
and
producing
C
6
H
12
O
6,
right.
So,
this
is
what
is
a
little
photosynthesis.
Similarly ,
we
can
also
look
at
respiration
cycles
and
there
you
see
lot
many
cycles
are
there
and
they
are
called
biochemical
cycles
and
these
biochemicalcycles
are
utilizing
the
oxygen
or
they
are
using
oxygen.
Protein
amino
acid
they
are
coming
to
form
the
acetyl
CoA
or
this
is
the
cycle
that
is
known
as
Krebs
cycle
and
in
the
Krebs
cycle
the
respiration
rate
can
be
easily
determined
by
the
acid.
So,
thank
you
for
today's
class
next
day
we
will
come
with
another
opening.
Thank
you.
