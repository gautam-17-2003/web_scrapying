Basics of Refrigeration and Air Conditioning(Contd.)
So,
good
afternoon
my
dear
friends
and
students.
We
are
in
the
Refrigeration
and
Air
Conditioning
right.
And
we
have
already
said
that
the
two
types
of
refrigerations
are
used,
one
is
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system,
another
is
absorption
refrigeration
system,
vapor
absorption
refrigeration
system.
Now ,
vapor
absorption
refrigeration
system
is
not
widely
used,
and
that
is
why,
only
the
cycle,
we
have
shown,
and
the
detail
analysis,
we
said
that,
may
not
be
so
much
useful
for
us.
If
someone
wants
to,
typically ,
do
some
research
work,
and
lot
of
work
is
also
involved
in
that,
still
it
is
not
commercialized,
the
reason
being
the
requirements
for
that
is
not
so
well
developed
right.
So,
as
a
continuation
of
this,
the
basics
of
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning,
we
are
continuing in this class.
So,
we
come
to
the
next
that
is
called
Evaporative
Cooling.
Now ,
evaporative
cooling,
I
told
you
also
in
the
previous
some
class,
that
the
cooling
tower ,
which,
is
used,
is
also
an
evaporative
cooling
right.
So,
the
best
example
could
have
been,
by
the
farmers,
but,
unfortunately
in
our
country ,
again,
when
things
do
not
come
from
outside,
or
abroad,
they are not taken into serious  consideration.  This is of f the cuf f statement.
The
reason
being
that,
this
system,
could
have
been
so
well,
so
good
for
farmers,
for
giving,
at
least
7-10
days
in
good
condition,
before
it
goes
to
the
market,
or
before
it
goes
to
the
cold
storages,
it
could
have
been
well
used.
Besides,
at
home
also
you
are
using,
those
who
are
in
hot
areas,
like
Delhi,
Rajasthan,
in
this
eastern
part,
say
Jamshedpur ,
part
of
Bihar
etc.,
not
in
Bengal,
because,
Bengal,
humidity
is
very
high.
And
as
I
told
you
earlier
also
many
times
that,
the
dry
and
wet
bulb,
these
two
are
very
fundamental,
right.
More
than
dry,
wet
bulb
is
more
fundamental,
because
you
cannot
cool below the wet bulb  temperature, normally , with this kind of evaporative cooling.
And
that
is
why,
this
type
of
cooling
is
not
so
good
in
eastern
part
of
most
of
the
places,
like
Bengal,
as
a
whole,
no,
some
part
of
Bengal,
it
could
be,
like,
the
like,
the
village,
not
villages,
towns
like
Bankura,
Birbhum,
these
areas
also,
they
are
dry.
So,
dry
areas,
it
can
be
very
well
used.
So,
as
you
see
from
this
pictorial
view
that,
you
have
aperforated
net
kind
of
thing,
which,
can
absorb,
or
which
can
hold
some
water ,
on
the
top,
some
sprinklers
are
there,
and
this
is
sprinkling
some
water ,
and
you
are
blowing
hot
air,
and
when,
it
goes
through
this,
the
latent
heat
of
vaporization
of
the
water
is
taken
out
by
the
air,
and
air
gets
cooled,
and
it
also
carries
some
vapor
with
it.
That
is
why,
those,
who
are
using
this
desert
coolers,
you
have
observed
that,
the
doors
and
windows
are
kept
open.
Otherwise,
the
room
will
become,
again,
highly
moist,
and
the
purpose
will be  defeated.
So,
in
this
case,
air
in
contact
with
water
to
cool
it,
close
to
wet
bulb
temperature.
It
cannot
be
lower
than
the
wet
bulb
temperature,
close
to
wet
bulb
temperature.
In
dry
areas,
this
wet
bulb
temperature,
it
is
very
low.
So,
it
is
very
very
effective
there.
Advantage
is
that,
it
is
efficient
cooling
at
low
cost,
but,
as
I
told
that,
our
Indian
farmers, they are so rich, or so callous, or whatever you call.
Have
you
ever
seen
anywhere,
any
farmers
whatever ,
whether
farming
fruits
or
vegetables
or
leafy
vegetables,
anything,
are
they
using
similar
kind
of
cooling?
No.
At
least,
minimum
20
to
30
interactions,
directly ,
one
to
one
with
them,
in
groups,
I
have
told
that
this
can
be
very
easily
constructed,
as
well
as
maintained,
and
this
is
good
for
you,
with
minimum,
no
cost,
because,
that
air,
which
is
coming,
that
is,
by
the
nature,
you
do
not
have
to
use
fan
also,
but
it
is
not
being
used.
There
is
a
disadvantage,
that
is,
air
is
rich
in
moisture,
as
I
told
that,
when,
from
the
left
to
the
right,
as
in
the
picture,
you
are
moving,
then,
the
air
is
getting
cold,
but,
it
is
also
carrying
some
moisture.
So,
the
humidity ,
that
will
go
up,
and
again,
the
term
discomfort,
will
start
and
that
is
why,
the
windows
and
doors
are
normally
kept
open.
Now ,
if
we
analyze
this,
there
are
occasions,
where,
air
conditioning,
which
are,
which
stipulates
control
of
humidity ,
up
to
50
percent,
for
human,
control
or
comfort,
or
for
process
can
be
replaced
by
a
much
cheaper
and less ener gy intensive evaporative cooling.
Evaporative
cooling
is
an
extremely
efficient
means
of
cooling
at
very
low
cost.
The
concept
is
very
simple,
and
is
the
same
as
that
of
used
in
cooling
tower .
Air
is
brought
in
close
contact
with
water
to
cool
it
to
a
temperature,
close
to
the
wet
water
temperature.
The
cool
air
can
be
used
for
comfort
or
process
cooling.
The
disadvantage
is
that
the
air
is rich in moisture.
The
possibility
of
evaporative
cooling
is
specially
attractive
to
comfort
cooling
in
dry
regions.
The
principle
is
practiced
in
textile
industries
for
certain
processes.
Then,
assessment
of
refrigeration
is
like
this,
that,
cooling
effect
in
terms
of
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
or
tons
of
refrigeration.
One
ton
of
refrigeration
is
3024
kilo
calorie
per
hour,
or
roughly ,
3.52
kilowatt
heat
equivalent,
and
TR
is
assessed,
that
is,
tons
of
refrigeration,
is
assessed,
as
TR
is
equal
to
Q
into
C
p
into
delta
T,
that
is,
T
i
minus
T
o,over 3024.
This
is
one
empirical
relation,
and
in
terms
of
obviously ,
3024
is
in
kilo
calorie.
So,
on
that,
Q
is,
the
mass
flow
rate
of
the
coolant,
in
kg
per
hour,
C
p
is
the
coolant
specific
heat,
in
kilo
calorie
per
kg,
T
i
is
the
inlet
or
initial
temperature
of
the
coolant
to
the
evaporator ,
rather ,
or
chiller ,
in
centigrade
,and
T
o
is
outlet
temperature
of
the
coolant,
from
evaporator ,
or
chiller ,
in
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
another
relation
is
very
useful.
There
is
1
hp
is
0.746
kilowatt,
and
1
kilo
calorie
is
4.2
kilo
joules,
and
1
kilo
calorie
per
hour
is
1.1622
kilowatt,
right.
So,
these
data
are
very
much
helpful,
when,
you
are
calculating.
Specific
power
consumption,
the
moment
we
say,
the
specific,
it
is
per
unit
mass.  So, it is kilowatt per tonnage of refrigeration.
This
is
an
indicator
of
refrigeration
system's
performance,
and
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
of
centralized
chilled
water
system,
is
some
of
compressor ,
that
is,
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
chilled
water
pump,
that
is,
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
condenser
water
pump,
that
is,
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
and
cooling
tower
fan,
that
is,
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
All
put
together ,
gives
the
total
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
The
specific
power
consumption,
in
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
is
a
useful
indicator
of
the
performance
of
refrigeration
system
by
measuring
the
refrigeration
duty
performed
in
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
and
the
kilowatt,
of
course,
inputs
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
is
used
as
an
energy
performance
indicator .
In
a
centralized
chilled
water
system,
apart
from
the
compressor
unit,
power
is
also
consumed
by
the
chilled
water ,
that
is,
secondary
coolant
pump,
the
condenser
water
pump
for
the
heat
rejection
to
the
cooling
tower ,
and
the
fan
in
the
cooling
tower ,
these
are
used.
Then,
coefficient
of
performance,
which
we
have
seen
earlier ,
very
much,
that
COP
Carnot,
a
standard
measure
of
refrigeration
efficiency .
COP
Carnot
=    T
e
/ (T
c
- T
e
)
It
depends
on
evaporator
temperature,
T
e
and
the
condensing
temperature
T
c.
So,
COP
Carnot,
that
could
be
written
as,
T
e
over
T
c
minus
T
e,
and
COP
in
industry ,
is
calculated,
for
type
of
compressor ,
as
COP
is
cooling
effect,
that
is,
kilowatt
per
power
input
to
compressor ,
kilowatt,
that
we
have
also
seen
earlier .
The
theoretical,
coefficient
of
performance,
Carnot
COP
is
a
standard
measure
of
refrigeration
efficiency
of
an
ideal
refrigeration
system,
which,
depends
on
two
key
systems,
temperatures,
evaporator
temperature
T
e,
and
the
condenser
temperature
T
c,
but
COP
Carnot
is
only
a
ratio
of
temperatures,
and
does
not
take
into
account,
the
type
of
compressor .
Hence,
the
COP,
normally
used
in
industry
is
calculated
using
this
above
equation,
that
is
cooling
effect
in
kilowatt,
over
power
input
to
the
compressor ,
that
is,
also
in
kilowatt.
If
we
look
at
COP,
this
we
have
also
shown
earlier ,
the
effect
of
condenser
temperature,
and
the
effect
of
evaporator temperature, that, we have shown.
I
hope,
there
is
no
difference,
and
we
need
to
continue
it
again.
Then,
measure,
air
flow
that
is,
Q
in
meter
cube
per
second
at
fan
coil
units,
that
is,
fcu
of
air
handling
unit,
AHU.
Anemometer
is
used.
Air
density ,
rho,
that
can
be
used
by
any
density
meter ,
right
and
specific
gravity
meter ,
rather ,
in
kg
per
meter
cube.
Dry
bulb
and
wet
bulb
temperatures can be used by the help of the thermometer , right.
So,
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
we
can
say
is,
Q
into
rho
into
h
in
minus
h
out
over
3.52.
that
is
another
way
of
measuring
the
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
Enthalpy ,
that
is
kilo
calorie
per
kg
per
kelvin.
So,
of
inlet
air,
that
is,
h
in
and
outlet
air,
h
out,
can
be
used
from the psychometric  chart, right.
So,
if
we
want
to
calculate,
TR,
as
in
case
of
air
conditioning
units,
the
air
flow
at
the
fan
coil
units,
or
the
air
handling
units,
can
be
measured
with
the
help
of
anemometer .
Dry
and
wet
bulb
temperatures
are
measured
at
the
inlet
and
outlet
of
AHU,
or
bfcu
and
TR
is
calculated
as
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
where,
Q
can
be
air
flow,
and
rho
is
the
density
of
air,
h
in
is
enthalpy
of
inlet
air,
and
h
out
is
enthalpy
of
outlet
of
air.
Use
of
psychometric
charts
can
be
helpful
to
calculate
the
h
in
and
h
out
from
the
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
values,
which,
are
measured
during
trials
by
a
whirling
psychrometer ,
right,
which
we
have
also
shown.
Power
measurements,
at
compressor
pumps,
AHU
fans,
cooling
tower
fans,
can
be
taken
with
a
portable
load
analyzer ,
and
the
specimen
power
specific
power
consumption
can
be
then
calculated
right.
So,
we
can
come
to
indicative
TR
load
profile,
that
is,
small
office
cabinets,
can
be,
somewhere
0.1
tonnage
of
refrigeration
per
meter
square.
So
0.1
ton
per
meter
square,
in
1
meter
square
area,
0.1
ton, in 10 meter square area, it is  1 ton, right, meter square area, mind it.
So,
it
is
something,
3.3
meter
by
3.3
meter ,
so,
roughly
around
10
feet
by
10
feet,
right,
cabinet,
it
is
1
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
this
is
in
a
thumb
rule.
Medium
size
of
office,
where,
10
to
30
people
are
working
with
central
AC
rather ,
it
is
0.06
tonnage
of
refrigeration
per
meter
square.
Large
multi
storied
office,
that
complex
with
central
AC,
this can be 0.
04
tonnage
of
refrigeration
per
meter
square,
right.
So,
accuracy
of
measurement
is
the
assessment
consideration.
Inlet,
outlet
temperature
of
chilled
and
condenser
water
flow,
how
accurately
they
are
measured?
It
is
also
a
part
of
the
measurement.
Integrated
part
load
value,
that
is
IPLV,
there,
it
is
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration
for
100
percent
load,
but
most
equipment
operate
between
50
to
75
percent
of
the
full
load.
It
is
not
100
percent full load, it is mostly around 50 to 75 percent.
So,
IPLV
can
be
calculated
in
terms
of
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration
with
partial
loads,
and
4
points
are
used
in
this
case.
25,
50,
75
and
100,
these
are
the
4
points,
that
can
be
used,
right.
So,
accuracy
of
flow
and
temperature
measurements
are
very
important.
So,
we
have
already
said
in
a
field
performance
assessment,
accurate
instruments
are
required
to
measure
the
inlet
and
outlet
temperatures
of
chilled
water
and
condenser
water ,
preferably ,
with
a
least
count,
it
is
called,
of
at
least,
0.1
degree
centigrade.
Flow
measurement
of
chilled
water
can
be
made
with
an
ultrasonic
flow
meter ,
directly ,
or
can
be
determined,
based
on
pump
duty
parameters,
right.
And
then,
condenser
water
flow
can
also
be
measured
with
the
help
of
non-contact
flow
meter ,
directly ,
or
can
be
determined
by
using
pump
duty
parameters.
Then,
integrated
part
load
value,
that
is,
IPLV,
where,
although
the
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration
can
serve
as
an
initial
reference,
it
should
not
be
taken
as
an
absolute
guideline,
since,
this
value
is
based
on
a
100
percent
equipment
capacity .
But,
most
equipment
are
operated
between
50
percent
to
70
percent
of
the
capacity .
So,
to
overcome
this,
an
average
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration
with
partial
loads
has
to
be
determined,
which
is
called
the
integrated part load value, IPL V, right.
In
this
case,
obviously ,
I
would
like
to
say
that,
this
IPLV,
this
part,
we
are
not
so
much
concerned,
because
normally ,
we
do
not
operate
with
IPLV,
that
is
integrated
part
load,
that,
25
percent
of
the
full
load,
or
100
percent
of
the
full
load.
This
is
not
generallyobserved.
We
perform,
around
70
75
percent
by
and
large.
So,
may
not
be
the
part
load
is
so
much
important
to
us
at
this
moment.
So,
energy
efficiency
opportunities
are,
it
is
optimized
process
heat
exchange,
maintain
heat
exchanger
surfaces,
multi
staging
systems,
matching
capacity
to
system
load
capacity ,
control
of
compressors,
multilevel
refrigeration for plant needs, and chilled water storage  system design features.
These
are
energy
efficiency
opportunities.
Now ,
optimized
process
heat
exchange
is
like
this,
proper
sizing,
heat
transfer
areas
of
heat
exchangers,
and
evaporators
are
required.
Heat
transfer
coefficient,
on
refrigerant
side,
normally ,
taken
as
1400
to
2800
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin,
whereas,
heat
transfer
area
during
the
refrigerated
side
is
generally ,
greater
than
0.5
meter
square
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
Optimum
driving
force,
that
is,
the
difference
between
Te
and
Tc
is
1
degree
centigrade
rise,
in
Te
is
equal
to 3 percent power savings.
So,
it
is,
how
it
is
optimized,
that
if
you
can
increase
the
evaporator
temperature
by
1
degree
centigrade,
then
you
are
saving
power
by
3
percent,
right.
So,
this
we
are
skipping,
and
here
we
can
see
that
evaporator
temperature
of
5.0,
0,
minus
5,
minus
10,
minus
20,
with
refrigeration
capacity
in
terms
of
tonnages,
that
67.58,
56.07,
45.98,
37.20,
23.12,
and
specific
power
consumption
of
different
numbers,
0.81,
0.94,
1.08
and
1.25,
1.67,
these
increase
in
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
So,
these
are
that
based
on
compressor
temperature
of
40
degree
centigrade
and
not
only
40
degree
centigrade,
but
at
different
evaporator
temperatures
of
5.0,
minus
5,
0,
minus
10,
minus
20
and
the
refrigeration,
it
is
in
terms
of
tonnage
of
refrigeration
67.58,
56/07,
45.98,
37.2,
23.12,
like
that
and
the
specific
power
consumption,
comes
to,
0.81
that
is
high
evaporator
temperature,
low
tonnage
of
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
that
is,
specific
power
consumption,
and
minus
20,
so
low,
is
1.67.
So,
increase
in
kilowatt
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration
is
around
106
percent.
So
high,
if
the
evaporator
temperature
is
lowered, right, which we have already said earlier also, right.
So,
that
was
for
evaporator
temperature
different,
but
condenser
temperature
fixed.
The
first
table,
there
are
two
tables
of
course,
yeah,
this
is
one,
and
the
other
one
was,
this
is
also
condenser
temperature,
this
is
also
condenser
temperature
40
degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
the
first
table
shows
that,
the
effect
of
evaporation
temperature
on
the
compressor
power
consumption
at
a
constant
condenser
temperature
of
T
c
40
degree
centigrade,
and
lower
evaporator
temperature,
reduce
the
refrigeration
capacity ,
that
is
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
and
increase
the
power
consumption.
Second
table,
that
is,
what
we
have
shown,
is
the
effect
of
condensing
temperature
on
the
compressor
power
consumption
at
a
constant
evaporator
temperature
of
T
e
of
10
degree
centigrade
increasing
the
condensing
temperature
leads
to
a
reduction
of
the
refrigeration
capacity
and
an
increase
in
the
power
consumptions.
Then,
the
contribution
can
be
drawn,
is,
that,if
you
try
to
keep
the
difference
between
T
e
and
T
c
at
an
optimum
level,
to
ensure
the
best tonnage of refrigeration, at the lowest  power of consumption, right.
So,
I
hope,
some
of
the
information
are
very
good,
and
it
is
corroborating
whatever
earlier
we
also
had
said,
that
the
specific
power
consumption
increase
or
decrease
with
the
evaporator
or
condenser
temperature,
increase
or
decrease
these
relations
with
tabular
form
we
have
corroborated
the
earlier
facts,
which
we
have
already
said.
I
hope
that,
whatever
we
are
saying,
that
is,
corroborating
whatever
earlier
cycles,
and
the
analysis,
we
have
done,
these
are
the
practical
numbers,
which
are
available
commercially ,
right.
So,
with
this,
perhaps,
we
come
to,
or
maybe
another
class
will
be
required,
to
complete
that
air
conditioning
and
refrigeration,
because,
some
more
things
are also to be told.  You must know that, cascading, many cases cascading are used, right.
So,
those
kind
of
things
are
still
there.
So,
you
may
need,
one
more
class,
for
this
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning.
You
are
gradually
heading
towards
completion
of
the
cooling
production,
and
then
it
will
come
to
our
utilization,
maybe
after
few
classes,
we
will
start
with
that,
right.
So,
no,
there
are
some
more,
which
may
take
a
little
time,
that
is,
the
individual
component,
that
is,
compressor ,
condenser ,
evaporator ,
expansion
device.  So, at least few classes, we have to spend on that.
So, let us see, how we can procee, ok.  So, thank you all.
