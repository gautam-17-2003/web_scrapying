Cold
Chain
and
Cold
Storage
Good
afternoon,
my
dear
students
and
friends.
Now,
we
come
to
another
very
important
one
as
far
as
cold
is
concerned,
or
cooling
and
subsequent
its
use,
that
we
should
maintain
cold
chain,
because,
the
moment
you
are
freezing,
it
should
have
a
cold
chain,
which
will
lead
to
the
cold
storage,
and
from
there,
it
will
go
to
the
retail
users.
Unfortunately ,
in
our
country,
as
of
today,
cold
chain
is
a
concept
only,
it
is
not
in
reality,
though
may
be
several
governments,
whether,
central
or
local,
they
are
trying
their
best,
but
as
of
now,
I
don't
think,
it
has
come
to
that
level.
However,
it
is
not
today,
does
not
mean,
it
will
not
be
tomorrow,
because
it
is
highly
needed,
that
is
why,
it
is,
it
has
to
be.
So,
what
we
can
say
that,
in
cold
chain,
and
cold
storage,
the
same,
which
we
started
with,
that
is
the
cold
preservation,
that
comes
directly
in.
Every
10
degree
centigrade
rise
or
fall
will
make
the
rates
of
reaction
double
or
half,
roughly,
this
we
had
said
earlier
also,
right.
Q

/
K
T
10
o
C
lowering
of
temperature
makes
shelf
life
almost
double
Then,
we
can
say
so,
what
is
a
cold
chain?
A
cold
chain,
typically,
consists
of,
pretreatment
at
the
place
of
harvest,
refrigeration
or
freezing,
or
food
processing
plant,
why
you
are
saying
refrigeration,
and
freezing,
because
it
is
not
necessarily
all
the
materials
to
be
frozen.
It
depends
on,
there
are
many
materials,
which
are
not
below
sub
0,
but
they
are
cold,
right,
like
apple,
it
Is
around
2
degree,
potato
is
around
2
degree.
So,
it
is
not
required
that
it
has
to
be
frozen,
yes,
if
you
are
handling
with
meat
fish
etc.
then,
they
are
to
be
frozen
obviously,
for
long
preservation.
We
can
say
that,
we
will
not
do
that
cold,
or
freezing,
rather
for
every
material,
right.
Then,
we
can
say
that,
refrigeration,
during
transit,
it
is
a
must,
whether
it
is
frozen,
or
unfrozen.
Now,
you
imagine
that,
you
have
taken
apple
from
Kashmir.
Kashmir
is
at
very
low
temperature,
so,
you
have
no
problem,
apple
can
be
there,
but
you
want
to
go
to
Kerala
from
Kashmir.
So,
it
is
a
huge
distance,
and
during
this
huge
distance,
apple
is
supposed
to
be
at
2
degree
centigrade,
and
if
you,
and
if
it
is
not
sub
0,
is
supposed
to
be
at
2
degree
centigrade,
why,
I
take
it
for
commercial
purpose
that,
it
is
plus
minus
2
degree
centigrade.
So,
it
may
be
minus,
I
mean
it
may
be
1
degree
to
3
degree,
if
we
take1
degree
as
a
variation,
right.
Then,
unless
you
have
this
cold
chain,
up
to
the
end
point
obviously,
apple,
which
was
at
Kashmir,
the
quality
of
apple
at
Kerala
will
not
be
the
same,
right.
So,
it
is
ultimately
you,
that
is
the
user,
you
as
the
user,
is
deprived.
So,
our
objective
is
that,
the
refrigeration,
during
transit
should
be
maintained.
Then,
if
it
is
that,
it
is
not
from
Kashmir,
it
is
going
directly
to
Kerala,
may
be
from
Kashmir,
it
is
coming
to
say,
somewhere
in
between
Bombay,
and
from
Bombay
it
is
going
to
Kerala.
So,
there
has
to
be
some
storage
facility.
So,
that
is
why
storage,
in
cold
storages,
that
is
also
required.
Then,
refrigerated
displays
at
supermarkets,
that
when
it
reaches
to
the
end
user,
then
obviously,
that
could
be
displayed,
could
be
a
concern.
Refrigerated
storage
at
customer
place
before
consumption.
So,
every
stage,
you
are
from
the
field
to
the
fork,
that
is
what
it
is
said,
from
the
field
to
the
fork,
that
must
be
maintained,
that
cold
chain
must
be
maintained.
This
is
the
basic
concept
of
cold
chain.
Now,
benefits
of
cold
storages
are
many,
like
it
equalizes
the
prices
throughout
the
year.
Then,
no
distress
sell
during
harvest
season,
and
products
will
be
available
round
the
year
and
products
available
in
areas,
where
they
are
not
grown
at
all,
right.
Like
potato
is
one
of
the
component,
one
of
the
commodity ,
which
is
not
produced
all
over
India.
It
is
not
produced
all
over
India,
at
places,
like
places
in
Bengal,
maybe
places,
some
in
Bihar,
maybe
places
in
UP,
like
that
it
is
produced
and
they
are
feeding
all
over
the
Indian
map,
right.
So,
all
these
factors
are
required
to
be
given
due
concern.
Unfortunately ,
again
and
again,
I
am
saying
that,
as
of
today,
it
is
not
up
to
the
mark.
Now,
definitely,
you
see
that,
effect
of
the
storage
temperature,
products
like
meat,
average
useful
storage
life,
if
it
is
stored
at
0
degree,
6
to
10
degree,
10
days,
if
it
is
22
degree
it
is
1
day,
if
it
is
38
degree
centigrade
less
than
a
day.
Similarly,
for
fish,
if
it
is
0
degree,
2
to
7,
if
it
is
again
22,
1
day,
and
again,
38,
less
than
a
day,
but
dry
meats
and
fish,
0
degree,
it
is
more
than
1000.
So,
2
to
3
years
or
even
more
even
at
22
degree
centigrade
350
to
1000
days
or
at
38
degree
centigrade,
even
it
is
100
to
350
days.
If
it
is
dry
or
dry
fish
or
meat,
the
moment
dry
fish,
meat
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
water
content,
right,
or
M
w
,
what
is
the
water
content
of
the
material.
Since
it
is
dry
so,
that
earlier,
I
said
about
water
activity,
A
w
.
So,
that
water
activity
is
also
much
much
reduced
in
the
dried
fish
or
meat.
So,
chances
of
its
getting
rotten
is
much
much
less.
So,
that
is
why,
to
the
tune
of
1000
days
it
is
kept
at
even
higher
temperature,
right,
but,
for
fruits
like
0,
it
is
3
to
20
days,
again
22
degree,
1
to
20
days,
depending
on
the
fruit
and
38
degree,
between
1
to
7
days.Yes,
it
is
1
day
38
degree
centigrade
it
is
1
day,
or
2
days
7
day
rarely
rarely
some
fruits.
Again
dry
fruits,
the
moment
you
are
talking
about
dry,
the
moisture
content
and
ultimately
water
activity
comes
in.
So,
1000
days
or
150
or
350
days
are
not
that
impossible,
but
if
it
is
leafy
vegetable,
0
degree
around
3
to
20
days,
22
degree
centigrade
1
to
7
days,
and
38
degree
centigrade
1
to
3
days,
here
it
has,
these
are
leafy
vegetable.
And
you
know,
leafy
vegetables
are
very
much
moisture
content
material,
right.
Root
crops,
root
crops,
one
of
the
root
crops,
best
that
is
potato,
which
is
widely
used
in
India
all
over
the
world
of
course.
So,
that
is
0
degree
90
to
300
days,
not
90
it
is
around
300
days
because,
if
you
go,
when
we
will
go
to
cold
store
we
will
see
that
it
is
0
degree,
but
not
0
somewhere
plus
2
degree,
it
can
be
stored
around
9
to
10
months.
And
this
is
the
time
when
the
cold
stores
will
be
starting
releasing
all
the
materials,
and
the
maintenance
of
the
plants
will
be
done.
Then,
dry
seeds,
again
dry,
the
moment
it
is
dry,
your
storage
days
are
also
up
right.
Then
we
come
to
classification
of
refrigerated
storage
which
we
have
said
perhaps
earlier
a
little
that
short
term
storage
is
1
to
15
days
long
term
storage
is
10
to
10
days
to
6
to
8
months,
and
frozen
storage
is
as
I,
as
high
as
few
years.
Ice
cream,
generally
can
be
stored
for
even
2
years
in
a
cold
store
if
maintained
at
minus
18
or
below,
right,
that
is
one
of
the
most
vulnerable
product.
For
short
term
and
long
term
storage
between
0
to
16
degree
centigrade
which
are
above
freezing
point
and
for
frozen
storage
between
23
to
minus
18
minus
18
is
the
common,
it
is
for
frozen
storage.
Of
course,
for
storage,
you
are
using
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system,
when
you
are
talking
about,
that
time
I
repeatedly
said
one
of
the
major
application
will
be
during
may
be
freezing
apart
and
storage
another
part.
So,
the
same
compressor ,
sorry,
the
same
compressor
condenser
expansion
valves
and
evaporator ,
this
is
the
cycle
right.
And
once
this
cycle,
we
have
studied
in
detail,
and
this
is
a
typical
cold
storage,
which
I
said,
no,
I
will
tell
you,
I
will
show
you,
when
we
are
coming
to
cold
store,
that
these
are
the
compressor
units,
right.
So,
this
is
that
compressor
units,
it
is
very
difficult,
of
course,
to
say
that,
we
have
also
said
in
some
cases,
that
there
are
some
accumulators,
which
is
coming
out
from
the
compressor ,
right,
where
the
lubricant
is
separated,
right.
So,
you
see
that,
these
are
that
reciprocating
type
of
compressors,
may
be
80
hp,
100
hp,
or
even
more,
but
you
see,
the
size
is
so
big.
If
you
still
compare
with
the
one,
which
you
have
at
your
home,
you
will
see,
if
this
is
this
big,
that
becomes
this
much
only,
right.
And
this
is
80
to
100
hp
and
that
is
perhaps
0.5
hp
around,
right.
Obviously,
the
more
the
hp,
the
bigger
is
the
size,
right,
and
more
are
the
piping
and
other
things.
Now,
in
handling
the
cycles,
in
many
cases,
we
could
not
have
taken
care
of
the
pipelines,
but
in
some
cases,
afterwards,
we
have
used
using
Bernoulli's
equation,
but
generally,
they
arevery
very
complicated,
in
the
sense
that,
if
they
are
not,
the
other
day
I
said,
that,
if
matching
is
not
done
properly,
then
oversize
or
undersize
will
jeopardize
the
entire
system.
That
is
one
of
the
prime
factor,
that
no
over
sizing
or
unnecessarily
no
undersizing
is
allowed.
Then,
we
come
to
the
other
one,
which
I
was
repeatedly
saying
that
condenser,
this
is
a
commercial
type
of
condenser,
right.
I
could
not
take
the
bigger
size
of
the
condenser
in
photograph,
because
view
was
not
proper,
but
this
is
good
enough
to
explain
many
many
things
to
you.
As
you
see
that,
there
are
water
spray
facilities
over
the
coils.
Now,
as
you
also
see,
say,
a
single
coil,
if
we
take
from
here,
that
will
be
easier,
at
least
for
me,
say
this
one,
right.
So,
this
is
coming
up
to
this,
then
a
vertical
down,
then
again
horizontal
down,
then
a
vertical
up.
So,
this
way
say,
if
this
is
said
3
meter,
or
4
meter.
So,
4
meter
by
say
2
meter,
again
4
4
8
2
2
4.
So,
around
10
to
12
meter
per
unit
right.
There
are
so
many
tens
of
100
such
units
are
there.
If
you
remember,
I
said
the
condenser
and
evaporator
coils,
they
range
from,
maybe
30
to
35
kilometers
in
length
right.
And
this
one
being
typically
for
ammonia,
with
that,
I
know
because,
I
have
taken
the
photograph.
So,
that
I
know
that
this
is
for
ammonia
right.
So,
there
the
water,
which
comes
over
it,
sorry,
the
water
which
comes
over,
it
is
spread
all
over,
right
and
air
is
blown
right.
So,
like
our
cooling
tower,
so,
when,
air
is
blown,
how
much
temperature
it
can
be
cooled,
that
also
I
said
earlier,
that
it
can
be
cooled
up
to
a
temperature
or
little
above
than
the
T
WB
,
that
is,
wet
bulb
temperature,
right.
So,
little
above
wet
bulb
temperature,
we
can
cool
down
the
condenser.
This
cooling
rather,
temperature,
right.
So,
what
air
will
moving
up,
it
is
taking
the
latent
heat
of
vaporization
and
that
gets
cold
and
ultimately
the
condenser,
which
is
at
high
pressure
and
high
temperature
at
the
inlet
of
the
condenser
is
coming
down
to,
maybe
the
pressure,
condenser
pressure
is
same,
but
the
temperature
is
much
lower.
So,
though
if
we
see
our
cycle,
which
was
there,
the
condenser
was
under
constant
temperature
T
c,
because
basically
the
vapor
is
getting
cooled.
The
refrigerant
vapor
which
came
out
from
the
compressor
at
high
pressure
P
condenser
and
high
temperature
T
condenser.
So,
now
P
condenser
is
maintained
and
T
condenser
is
maintained,
but
the
phase
is
getting
changed,
it
was
vapor,
now
it
is
liquid
right.
So
many
things
are
to
be
said
here,
one
is
that
we
told
that,
water,
which
is
used
for
cooling
this
condenser,
as
it
is
appearing,
the
pipes,
if
it
is
for
ammonia
then,
it
has
to
be
not
copper,
or
steel,
it
is
mild
steel,
because,
it
is
corrosive.
So,
after
sometime,
mild
steel
is
less
expensive.
So,
after
some
years,
or
sometime,
maybe
part
or
whole
has
to
be
replaced
or
repaired.So,
if
the
water
and
the
temperature
being
T
c
very
high,
T
c
is
inside,
but
T
c
is
from
the
outside,
what
we
are
observing
right.
So,
that
is
being
cooled
by
the
water.
Now
if
the
water
is
not
good,
then
what
will
happen,
and
you
remember
the
other
day
we
had
said
that
hard
water
and
soft
water.
So,
if
it
is
not
soft
water,
hard
water,
then
some
precipitate
of
the
salts
will
take
will
occur
in
the
pipelines.
And
the
moment,
that
precipitation
of
the
salts
are
happening,
the
heat
transfer
is
drastically
reduced,
right.
Fine
film
of
the
coating
of
the
sediment
is
good
enough
to
reduce
the
heat
transfer
drastically,
right.
This
normally,
the
people
who
are
operating,
do
not
understand,
neither
they
do
take
care
of
it.
So,
the
water,
which
you
are
supplying
for
cooling,
has
to
be
very
very
soft
and
treated
water.
Here
you
are
not
blowing
any
air
through
some
fan,
or
blower.
It
is
normally
by
the
natural
convection
of
the
nature
that
is
reality
in
every
cold
store.
So,
if
it
is
normally
by
the
natural
convection
in
this.
So,
this
is
to
be
situated
in
a
place
where
if
this
is
the
coal
store
and
if
this
is
south
normally
our
air
flows
at
least
towards
the
eastern
part
from
south
to
north
in
most
of
the
part
of
the
air
except
winter
season
when
it
is
from
north
to
south.
So,
this
condenser
coils
should
be
away
from
the
building
where
freely
air
can
move,
then
only,
it
will
be
cooled
very
easily
very
fast.
Unfortunately ,
to
save
the
space,
or
whatever,
if
you
go
and
study
most
of
the
cold
stores
they
are
primarily
behind
the
coal
room
space.
So
getting
the
air
flow
obstructed.
So
water
is
not
purified,
water
is
not
rectified,
water
is
not
rather
treated
this
is
a
defect,
second
is
air
flow,
right.
So
both
are
reducing
the
heat
transfer
drastically.
So,
what
will
happen,
your
Pc
will
be
and
Tc,
this
PcTc
fine,
but
some
unconverted
vapour
may
come
out
from
the
exit,
which
may
get
into
the
inlet
of
the
valve,
that
is
expansion
valve.
So,
this
most
of
the
people
do
not
consider,
so
nicely
or
easily
ok.
I
think
our
time
is
today
over,
in
the
next
class
we
will
complete
this
cold
store.
So
that
we
can
go
for
the
last
two
classes,
for
ice
cream
that
is
one
of
my
very
favourite,
ok.
Thank
you
so
much
of
you.
