Condenser
Good
afternoon
my
dear
students,
and
good
afternoon
to
all
of
you.
My
friends,
who
are
attending
the
course,
we
have
completed
compressors.
Now ,
we
go
to
another
very
useful
and
very
much
required,
may
not
be
the
heart
of
the
refrigeration
system,
but
this
is
also,
may
be
equivalent
to
lung,
right.
Because,
compressor ,
if
it
be
heart,
then,
condenser ,
and
evaporator ,
could
be
equal
to
lung.
Because,
condenser
and
evaporator ,
both
are
heat
exchangers
basically .
Compressor
is
dif ferent,
because,
it
is
compressing,
expanding
by
that
process,
it
is
making
the
vapour
at
high
temperature
high
pressure,
but
it
is
not
so
in
case
of
condenser
or
evaporator .
So,
we
will
proceed
to
condenser ,
and
then,
expansion
device,
and
then,
evaporator ,
as
the
cycle
following,
right.
W e
have
completed,
compressors,
now
condensers,
then,
expansion
device,
and
then,
the
evaporators,
right,
we
have
very
limited
time,
ok,
sorry .
So,
in
this
lecture,
we
are
coming
to
condenser .
So,
what
is
condenser?
So,
it
is
a
heat
exchanger ,
where,
the
refrigerant
is
first
dissipated,
and
then,
saturated
vapor ,
condenses,
into
liquid
state.
If
you
remember
that
cycle,
where,
NTS
diagram,
where,
we
had
compressed,
it,
whether ,
it
is
isentropic,
or
any
other
way ,
then,
it
comes
to
the
superheated
condition,
and
then,
it
gets
into
the
condenser ,
and
from
there,
the
expansion
device,
and
back
to
evaporator .
So,
this
was
our
cycle.
So,
here
it
gets
superheated.
So,
first
the
condenser
does
it,
dissipated,
the
vapour ,
or
gas,
which,
is
available
there,
right.
So,
the
liquid
may
be
sub
cooled
in
some
condensers,
unless,
the
step
is
there,
the
refrigerant
cannot
be
recycled,
which
step,
that
is,
super
cooling.
Because,
unless,
super
cooling
is
done,
then,
you
will
not
be
able
to
extract
the
heat
from
the
evaporator ,
right.
So,
though,
heat
transfer ,
the
heat
absorbed
by
the
evaporator ,
at
low
temperature,
and
the
work
of
compression
are
rejected
to
the
surroundings,
the
heat
is
rejected,
either
to
air
directly ,
or
to
water ,
which,
in
turn,
rejects,
it
to
the
surroundings
in
a
cooling
tower .
The
heat
transfer
coef ficient,
h
c
is
small
invapour
phase,
but
the
temperature
dif ference
between
the
refrigerant,
and
the
coolant,
that
is
delta
T ,
is
lar ge.
In
some
of
the
cases,
this
delta
T ,
you
have
written
with
small
t,
but
it
is
capital
T ,
right,
while,
during
the
condensation,
the
heat
transfer
coef ficient
is
lar ge,
but
the
temperature
dif ference
is
small.
As
a
result
the
product
of
h
c
into
delta
T
is
approximately
same
in
both
the
regions.
Now ,
hence,
we
can
tell
that,
while,
designing,
it
can
be
assumed
that,
the
condenser ,
or
condensation,
occurs
through,
throughout
the
condenser
itself,
whether ,
it
is
superheated
portion
or
sub
cooled
portion,
that
we
have
shown
that,
the
heat
transfer
coef ficient
times
the
delta
T ,
more
or
less
equal
to
same
remaining.
So,
another
term,
which,
is,
heat
rejection
ratio,
right,
heat
rejection
ratio,
that
we
must
know ,
that,
it
is
the
ratio
of
heat
rejected
to
the
heat
absorbed
ratio
of
heat
rejected
to
the
heat
absorbed.
So,
heat
rejection
ratio
R,
can
be
said
equal
to
Q
c
to
Q
e,
Q
c
is
the
heat
rejection
and
Q
e
is
the
heat
absorption.
So
this
Q
c
is
Q
e
plus
W
c,
earlier
we
have
also
seen,
over
Q
e.
So,
it
is
1
plus
1
by
COP ,
because
COP ,
we
have
seen
to
be
equal
to
Q
e
over
W
c,
how
much,
we
have
given,
how
much
we
have
obtained,
that
is
the
COP ,
right.
So,
heat
rejection
ratio
is,
1
plus
1
by
COP ,
right,
for
a
fixed
evaporator
temperature,
as
the
condenser
temperature
increases,
the
COP
decreases,
and
the
heat
rejection
ratio
also
increases,
because,
if
COP
is
decreasing,
that
means,
this
part
is
low .
So,
1
by
this
part
is
high.
So
1
plus
this
part
is
high,
right,
it
is
high,
that
way .
So,
R
is
increasing
right.
Then
for
a
fixed
condenser
temperature,
as
the
evaporator
temperature
decreases,
the
COP
decreases,
and
the
heat
rejection
ratio
also
increases,
the
same,
which,
we
earlier
had
said,
but,
here,
only
a
new
term,
that
is,
heat
rejection
ratio,
R,
we
have
introduced,
and
said
the
ef fect
of
condenser
and
evaporator
temperature
ef fect.
T ypes
of
condenser:
there
are
3
types,
one
is
air
cooled,
there
are
3
types,
one
is
air
cooled
condensers,
another
is
water
cooled
condenser ,
and
third
one
is
evaporative
condensers,
right.
So,
depending
on
the
geometry
and
the
type
of
heat
transfer ,
the
condensers
are
further
classified
as,
rather ,
it
is
further
classified,
and
that,
we
can
say
to
be,
that
the
temperature
dif ference,
if
it
is
T c
minus
T
coolant,
that
is
T
condenser
minus
T
evaporator .
If
it
is
air
cooled,
then,
the
temperature
is
around
50
to
20
degree
centigrade,
whether ,
if
it
is
water
cooled,
then
it
is
6
to
12
degree
centigrade.
V olumetric
flow
rate
of
the
coolant
per
unit
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
air
cooled,
it
is
12
to
20
cubic
millimeter ,
whereas,
for
water
cooled,
it
is
7
to
20
liters
per
minute.
Heat
transfer
area
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration
for
air
cooled,
required
is,
10
to
15
meter
square,
whereas,
for
water
cooled
it
is
only
0.5
to
1meter
square.
Gas
velocity ,
that
is,
2
to
5
meter
per
second,
in
terms
of
air
cooled,
and
in
terms
of
water
cooled,
it
is
2
to
3
meter
per
second,
and
then,
power
consumption
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
if
it
is
air
cooled,
blower
is
0.1
to
0.2
hp,
whereas,
pump,
for
power
pump,
for
water
cooled,
is
negligible,
right.
So,
air
cooled
vis-a-vis
air
cooled
condenser ,
that
is
only
air ,
advantage
of
air
cooled
condensers
is
like
that,
simple
in
construction,
disposal
of
warm
air
is
not
a
problem,
and
available
in
plenty ,
air
is
plenty
available.
Cleaning
of
condenser
is
also
small,
maintenance
is
also
of
very
low
cost.
Disadvantage
of
air
cooled
condensers
are,
in
this
regard,
let
me
also
tell
you,
once
more,
that
our
household
refrigerator ,
which,
are
old
type,
which
is
having
on
the
back,
that
net
type
condenser ,
that
is
air
cooled,
right
and
no
maintenance,
there
is
no
such
deposition
of
anything
on
the
condensers,
other
than
some
dust
and
other
things,
which,
you
can
just
blow
or
take
out.
Since,
air
has
one-fourth
specific
heat,
and
one-hundredth
of
density ,
than,
those
of
water ,
the
volume
flow
rates
required
are
very
lar ge.
Since,
thermal
conductivity
of
air
is
also
very
small,
the
heat
transfer
coef ficient
is
also
very
small,
and
available
air
is
at
dry
bulb
temperature,
whereas,
water
is
available
at
low
temperature,
that
is
2
to
3
degree
centigrade
above
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
The
rise
in
temperature
is
much
higher
than
that
of
the
water ,
and
hence
the
condenser
temperature
becomes
very
lar ge.
Therefore,
COP
reduces,
its
use
is
normally
restricted
to
10
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
although,
blower
power
goes
up
beyond
5
ton
of
refrigeration.
In
middle
east
countries,
where,
there
is
scarcely ,
or
scarcity
of
water ,
or
fresh
water ,
air
cooled
condensers
are
used
up
to
even
hundred
tons
of
refrigeration,
or
more.
Its
cost
is
2
to
3
times
more
than
that
of
water
cooled
condenser ,
but
they
have
no
water ,
so
what
they
can
do?
So,
they
are
buying
air
only .
So,
water
cooled
condensers,
requires
cooling
tower
to
recycle
the
water
and
minimize
the
loss
of
water .
Unfortunately ,
the
installation,
and
maintenance,
installation
and
maintenance
cost,
they
are
high
of
cooling
tower ,
of fset
the
cost
of
advantage
of
water
cooled
condensers,
because,
the
maintenance,
and
installation
of
the
cooling
towers,
are
also
high.
But,
running
cost
for
the
condensers
are
also
small,
and
also
you
can
beautify
your
place
with
the
cooling
tower .
Fowling,
on
the
heat
exchanger
surface
is
a
big
problem
in
use
of
water
cooled
condensers,
right.
If
you
remember ,
by
mistake,
I
now
realize
that,
by
mistake,
we
had
said,
here,
air
cooled
vis
a
vis
air
cooled,
no,
that
is
air
cooled
versus
this
one,
air
cooled
vis
a
vis
water
cooled,
ok.
So,
when
we
come
to
this
that
water
cooled
vis
a
vis
evaporative
condensers,
this
comparison,
then
evaporative
condensers,
that
is
cooling
tower ,
combine
the
features
of
cooling
tower ,
and
a
water
cooled
condensers
in
a
single
unit.
W ater
is
spread
from
the
top,
on
a
bank
of
tubes,
carrying
the
refrigerant,
and
air
is
induced
upwards.
This,
I
will
show
you
afterwards,
when
we
come
to
storage,
that
time,because,
every
time
showing
is
very
dif ficult.
Now ,
a
thin
water
film
around
the
condenser
tubes,
evaporates,
cooling,
evaporates,
cooling
the
refrigerant
in
the
condenser ,
this
is
called
evaporative
cooling,
and
the
huge
latent
heat
of
evaporation
is
utilized
to
cool
the
refrigerant.
The
heat
transfer
coef ficient
is
very
lar ge,
the
water
flow
counter
currently
to
the
air
flow ,
and
acts
as
a
cooling
tower .
In
the
evaporative
condenser ,
the
condenser
is
located
close
to
the
compressor ,
requiring
more
pipe
line,
right,
is
located
close
to
the
compressor ,
requiring
more
pipe
length,
ok.
Then,
these
pipes
feed
the
refrigerant
and
run
through
the
evaporative
condenser ,
the
compressor
power
is
little
higher ,
but
the
water
pump
power
is
less,
since
water
lines
are
short.
Whereas,
the
water
cooled
condenser
is
located
next
to
the
compressor ,
requiring
less
compressor
power ,
but
water
pump
power
is
lar ge,
because,
the
cooling
tower
is
located
outside.
T wo
types
of
air
cooled
condensers
are
there,
natural
and
forced
convection,
or
forced
convective
type.
Natural
convection
types
are
used
for
small
capacity
refrigeration
system,
such
as
the
household
refrigerators,
and
the
freezers.
The
condensers
are
either
plate
surface
type,
or
finned
tube
type,
air
velocity
typically ,
varies
between
2
to
3.5
meter
per
second,
with
air
flow
rates
of
12
to
20
centimeter
cubic,
right,
per
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
Specific
heat
of
air
is
1.005
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin,
and
the
density
is
1.2
kilo
joule,
rather ,
kg
per
meter
cube.
So,
for
one
tonnage
of
refrigeration,
the
temperature
rise,
that
is,
delta
T
a,
is
equal
to
say
3.5
into
167
over
1.2
into
1.005
into
16
over
60,
that
is,
10.9
degree
centigrade,
for
average
air
flow
rate
of
16
cubic
meter ,
or
rather ,
not,
cubic
meter ,
C
m
m,
that
is,
cubic
millimeter .
Since,
the
air
temperature
rises
by
10
to
15
degree
centigrade,
compared
to
3
to
6
degree
centigrade
for
water .
The
rise
of,
or ,
the
area
of
the
condensers,
seen
from
outside,
in
the
direction
of
air
flow
is
called
the
face
velocity ,
right.
So,
this
earlier
also,
we
termed,
so
the
face
velocity ,
we
can
say
is
the
condenser ,
seen
from
outside
in
the
direction
of
air
flow ,
and
that
is
called
the
face
velocity ,
which
is
obtained
as
the
volume
flow
rate
divided
by
the
face
area.
The
face
velocity
is
restricted
to
2
to
3.5
meter
per
second
to
minimize
the
pressure
drop
due
to
frictional
resistance.
The
coils
of
the
tubes
in
the
direction
of
flow
is
called
rows.
There
are
2
to
8
rows
of
the
tubes
that
can
be
there,
carrying
the
refrigerant.
T wo
types
of
finned
tubes
are
there,
that
is,
spiral
fins
and
continuous
flat
plate
fins.
Generally ,
the
fins
are
made
of
aluminum
and
the
tubes
are
made
of
copper
and
the
fitting
is
done
through
bulleting.
If
the
refrigerant
is
ammonia,
the
tubes
and
fins
are
made,
of
course,
of
mild
steel.
The
reason
being
that,
copper
or
aluminum,
they
are
reacting
to
the
ammonia,
right.
So,
which
are
either
cooled
or
galvanized,
of
course,
either
welded
or
galvanized.Finned
coils
are
very
compact.
The
secondary
surface
area
is
10
to
30
times
the
bare
pipe
area.
Heat
transfer
is
rather ,
in
finned
type
coils
are
very
complicated,
and
air
cooled
condensers
are
cross
flow
type,
with
flow
reversal,
on
the
refrigerant
side.
Now ,
if
we
see
in
this,
there
is
a
term
called
LMTD,
that
is
log
mean
temperature
dif ference.
Generally ,
it
is
defined
as
delta
Tm
and
that
is,
delta
T2
minus
delta
T1
over
ln
of
delta
T2
by
delta
T1,
right.
And
what
are
those
delta
T s?
Because,
heat
exchangers
come
in
so
many
shapes,
sizes,
makes,
and
models,
they
are
categorized,
according
to
common
characteristics.
Once,
one
common
characteristic,
that
can
be
used
to
categorize
them
is,
the
direction
of
flow .
That
two
of
fluids
have
directions,
relative
to
each
other ,
right.
The
three
categories
are
parallel
flow ,
counter
flow ,
and
cross
flow ,
right.
Now ,
parallel
flow
is
illustrated
as
in
the
figure
1.
What
is
that?
This
is
the
parallel
flow ,
right.
So,
you
see
here,
this
is
coming
and
this
is
also
going,
right,
which
are
all
parallel.
So,
that
is
why ,
it
is
called
parallel
flow ,
and
inlet
to
outlet,
the
temperature
distribution
of
the
two,
that
is,
inlet
and
outlet,
are
like
this.
This
is
the
typical
nature
of
the
parallel
flow
right.
Whereas,
the
counter
current,
ok,
first
let
us
complete
it
that,
in
this
case
the
two
fluids
entered
the
heat
exchanger
from
the
same
end,
with
a
lar ge
temperature
dif ference.
As
the
fluids
transfer
heat
as
the
fluids
transfer
heat,
rather
hotter
to
cooler ,
the
temperatures
of
the
two
fluids,
approach
each
other .
Note,
particularly ,
that
the
hottest
cold
fluid
temperature
is
always
less
than
that
of
the
coldest
hot
fluid
temperature,
right.
Then,
counter
flow ,
this
is
illustrated
in
the
next
one,
here,
you
see
that,
one
fluid
is
going
like
this,
another
fluid
is
coming
like
this.
So,
these
are
counter
flow ,
and
if
we
have
the
inlet
to
outlet
temperature
versus
that,
you
see,
inlet
to
outlet
of
one,
and
inlet
to
outlet
of
the
other
fluid,
they
are
in
the
reverse
direction,
right.
So,
we
can
say
that,
for
counter
flow
type,
for
counter
flow
type,
it
exists
when
the
two
fluids
flow
in
opposite
directions.
Each
of
the
fluids
enters
the
heat
exchanger
at
opposite
ends
because,
the
cooler
the
fluid
exists
the
counter
flow
heat
exchanger
at
the
end,
where
the
hot
fluid
enters
the
heat
exchanger ,
the
cooler
fluid
will
approach
the
inlet
temperature
of
the
hot
fluid.
Counter
flow
heat
exchangers
are
the
most
ef ficient
of
the
three
types
and
in
contrast
to
the
parallel
flow
heat
exchanger ,
the
counter
flow
heat
exchanger
can
have
the
hottest
cold
fluid
temperature,
greater
than
that
of
the
coldest
cold
fluid
temperature,
right.
Now ,
another
one
is
the
cross
flow ,
as
you
see,
from
here,
this
is
flowing
like
this,
and
there
is
a
perpendicular
to
this
another
fluid,
right.
So,
this
is
called
cross
flow
and
it
exists
when
one
fluid
flows
perpendicular
to
the
second
fluid,
that
is,
one
fluid
flows
through
tubes
and
the
second
fluid
passes
around
the
tubes
at
90
degree
angle.
Cross
flow
heat
exchangers
are
usually
finned
or
usually
found,
rather ,
in
applications,
where
on
the
fluids
char ges
or
rather
fluids
changes
state
that
is,
two
phase
flow
is
occurring
and
an
example
is
a
stream
is,
a
steam
systems,
rather
condensers,
in
which
the
steam
exit,
exiting
the
turbine
enters
the
condenser
shell
side,
and
the
cool
water
cooling
in
the
tubes,
cool
water
flowing
in
the
tubes,
absorbs
the
heat
from
the
steam
condensing
it
into
water .
Lar ge
volumes
of
vapour
may
be
condensed
using
this
type
of
heat
exchanger ,
or
the
flow
of
heat
exchanger
right.
Now ,
this
is
a
typical
problem,
if
you
have,
T
1,
90
degree
centigrade,
T
2,
80
degree
centigrade,
for
hot
fluid,
and
t
1,
30
degree
centigrade,
and
t
2,
70
degree
centigrade
for
whole
cold
fluid.
So,
LMTD,
that
can
be
for
counter
flow ,
it
is
32.74,
for
parallel
flow ,
it
is
27.9
degree
centigrade,
right,
whereas,
for
cross
flow
there
is
a
correction
factor ,
in
cross
flow
and
according
to
that,
once
you
have
the
correction
factor ,
then,
you
can
use
that
correction
factor ,
and
get
the
dif ference
around,
if
it
is
0.933,
that
is,
close
to
the
counter
flow .
Now ,
another
thing,
which,
we
have
shown,
is
the
mean
temperature
dif ference,
and
that
is
30.54,
whatever ,
you
check,
and
we
have
given
you,
the
relation.
So,
you
find
out
how
you
are
going
to
use
log
mean
temperature
dif ference
right.
So,
with
this,
perhaps,
there
is
no
time
now ,
we
stop
this
class,
but
we
will
continue
with
the
condenser
and
try
to
finish
in
the
next
class.
Thank
you
so
much.
