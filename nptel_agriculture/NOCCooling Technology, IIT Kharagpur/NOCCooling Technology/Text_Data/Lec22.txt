Psychr ometrics Contd
Good
morning
my
dear
students.
We
are
continuing
with
the
Psychrometrics,
right
and
the
psychrometrics
that
we
have
learnt
till
now,
how
to
draw
the
relative
humidity
line
right?
So,
we
have
come
to
know
dry
bulb,
we
have
come
to
know
saturation
temperature,
dry
bulb
temperature
and
relative
humidity
right.
Now ,
for
other
thing
like
humidity
ratio,
this
we
have
already
said
many
times
right
as
you
see
these
lines
are
humidity
ratios.
So,
what
we
do?
We
draw
that
outline.
So
outline
is
like
this
and
this
right.
I
am
not
mixing
up
with
relative
humidity ,
dry
bulb,
everything
then,
it
will
be
jumbled  together , afterwards obviously , we have to do.
Now ,
the
parallel
line
to
x
axis,
they
are
as
we
said
earlier
also,
they
are
the
humidity
ratio,
or
absolute
humidity
line.
So,
these
lines
are
humidity
ratio,
or
absolute
humidity
line
right.
So,
these
are
all
parallel
to
x
axis.
Again,
as
we
said,
the
earlier ,
that
you
can
buy between 0 to 50.
I
know
definitely ,
0
to
50
and
50
to
100,
are
available,
but
I
heard
from
students
that
in
between
are
also
available.
So,
if
it
is
0
to
50
so,
corresponding
to
the
temperature
these
relative
or
absolute
this
is,
these
are
the
absolute
humidity
numbers.
So,
those
are
available
and
they
are
putting
here,
whatever
be
the
number .
So,
those
numbers
are
printed
here.
So,
along
this
line
we
can
find
out
what
is
the
humidity
ratio,
or
absolute
humidity right.
So,
if
we
know
absolute
humidity ,
then,
along
the,
earlier
also
we
said
along
the
absolute
humidity
line,
when
we
are
reaching
to
the
saturation
line,
then
from
there,
the
vertical
line
is
indicating
the
saturation
temperature
right.
So,
once
we
have
come
to
know
this,
then
let
us
look
into
the
other
things
like
volume
right.
So,
volume,
again,
we
go
back
to
that
we
have
this,
this
is
the
line,
right
and
the
volume
lines,
as
you
see
from
these,
hopefully
you
can
see,
right
this
is
the
volume
line,
this
is
the
volume
line,
this
is
the
volume
line,
this
is
the
volume
line,
this
is
the
volume
line
right.
So,
these
are
volume
lines,
and
you
see,
these
are
having
certain
angle
with
the
x
axis.
Roughly ,
it
could be around 70 to 75 degree, roughly right.From
this,
you
know
that
it
could
be
70
to
75.
This
angle,
obviously ,
that
angle
will
be
the
rest
of
180
right.
So,
this
way,
you
are
drawing
the
volume
line
and
all
volume
lines
are
of
course,
parallel
this
was
not
parallel
right.
All
volume
lines
are
parallel.
So,
you
have
this,
you
have
this,
you
have
this,
you
have
this,
these
are
volume
lines
and
as
you
said roughly , it could be between 70 to 75 degree angle, with the x axis right.
So,
those
with
the
70
to
75
degree
line
with
the
x
axis,
they
are
volume
and
the
volume
numbers
are
also
given
here
right
like
here
it
is
14,
here
it
is
13.5,
here
it
is
13,
here
it
is
12.5, here it is 14.5 and here it is 15.  So, between 12.
5
to
15
the
lines
are
shown
right.
So,
they
are
quite
apart,
you
see
12,
obviously ,
that
air
with
water
that
is
air
water
mixture,
the
volumes
will
not
be
very
high,
right
rather ,
volumes
are,
their
density
are
low.
So,
specific
volume
are
high,
and
liquid
only
density
is
high.
So,
specific
volume
is
low
ok.
So,
only
volume,
that
is
not
the
specific,
where
the mass is not there.
So,
there
the
volumes
are
also
very
very
high
it
is
15,
14.5,
you
see,
the
distance,
this
distance  is maintained for 0.5 volume, this is 14.5, to 14, then to 13.5 to 13 to 12 to 12.
5,
like
that.
So,
all
the
lines,
which
are,
which
are,
making
around
70
to
75
percent,
inclination
with
the
x
axis,
that,
those
lines,
are
volume
lines
right.
Now ,
it
comes,
to
another ,
after
the
volume,
there
is
still
now,
there
are
two
more
we
have
not
done,
what
are
those
one
is
enthalpy
and
the
other
one
is
wet
bulb
right.
So,
these
two,
we
have
not,
done
if
we
say,
that,
instead
of
volume,
if
we
write
here,
wet
bulb,
w
e
t
b
u
l
b,
wet
bulb
lines,
l
i
n
e
s
ok.
So,
wet
bulb
lines
if
we
look
at,
then
again
we
go,
draw
the
basic,
and
the basic is like this.
So,
here,
here,
and
here,
ok.
So,
this
is
the
saturation,
100
percent
line,
100
percent
relative
humidity ,
and
volume
you
have
seen
it
is
around,
70
to
75
degree
angle
between
the
x
axis,
and
that.
But,
there
are
other
lines
also,
like
maybe,
a
roughly
to
45
degree
lines
are
there,
and
these
lines
are
reaching
again
to
the
saturation
line
right.
These
lines
are
reaching
to
saturation
line,
and
these
are
parallel
lines,
parallel
to
each
other
meeting
the
saturation
line
right.
Then,
where
from
we
are
getting
temperature,
because,
yes,
this
is
a
line
say
45
degree
line,
yes,
along
the
line,
I
can
move
fine,
yes,
along
the
line,
I
am
reaching
at
100
percent
relative
humidity
fine,
but,
where
from
I
get
the
temperature?
I
get
the
temperature,
when
it
is
intersecting
with
the
saturation
line,
from
that
point
of
vertical
line
to
the
x
axis,
that
is
wet
bulb
temperature,
right
that
is
a
wet
bulb
temperature.So,
what
did
I
do?
What
did
we
do
rather?
So,
in
the
45
degree
line
we
proceeded
up
to
the
saturation
let
me,
let
me,
let
me,
let
me,
clear
this
part,
otherwise,
it
is
becoming
clumsy .
So,
here
it
is
saturation.
So,
when
it
is
reaching
the
saturation
line,
from
there,
if
we
make
a
vertical,
where
it
is
intersecting
with
the
x
axis,
is
the
wet
bulb
line.
Obviously ,
this
will
have
a
number ,
whatever
20,
30,
40,
12,
depending
on
what
scale
you
have
chosen,
what
are
the
other
information.
So,
from
the
saturation
line,
a
vertical
reaching the x axis, intersecting there that point is what   the wet bulb temperature.
So,
wet
bulb
also,
you
are
getting
similar
to
dry
bulb,
vertical
and
saturation
also
you
are
getting,
similar
to
dry
bulb,
vertical,
but
the
difference
is
that
for
wet
bulb
line
you
are
moving
along
the
line
which
is
45
degree
and
these
lines
are
called
wet
bulb
lines.
Whereas,
for
saturation
we
were
moving
along
the
line,
which
is
parallel
to
x
axis
right,
and
which
is
meeting
the
saturation
line,
and
from
there,
the
vertical
reaching
the
x
axis
is
the
saturation
line,
or
temperature,
rather ,
right.
So,
all
6,
we
have
covered
how
to
draw
all
6
parameters
thermodynamic
parameters
in
the
psychrometric
chart.
Now ,
the
last
one
remaining
is
the,
last
one
remaining
is
the
enthalpy .
So,
enthalpy
lines,
they
are
also similar to, you see, wet  bulb.
So,
this
may
not
be
45,
may
be
around
40,
right
may
be
around
40
degree,
but
you
see,
the
gap
between
the
lines
and
these
lines
are
meeting
with
the
scale
that
is
the
enthalpy
scale.
So,
directly ,
from
there,
you
are
able
to
read
what
is
the
enthalpy .
So,
move
along
the
enthalpy
line,
where
it
is
reaching
in
the
scale,
you
can
say,
that
is
the
enthalpy .
So,
if
we
draw
that
in
as
we
have
also
drawn
outside,
because,
this
is
black
may
not
be
so
much
visible
from
your
side.
So,
if
we
do
this,
that
we
have
the
basic
drawing,
vertical
then, RH line 100 percent, then this, ok.
So,
the
there
is
a
scale
here,
and
that
is
called
your
enthalpy
scale
right.
So,
this
scale
and
along
this
scale,
the
lines
which
are
there,
they
are
called
the
enthalpy
lines
right.
So,
they
are
called
enthalpy
lines.
So,
these
are
the
enthalpy
lines
where
the
enthalpies
are
red
along
this
scale
right
along
this
scales
enthalpies
are
read
ok.
And
enthalpy ,
as
it
is
the
unit
of
the
enthalpy ,
will
be
of
course,
this
is
in,
as
it
is
written,
this
is
in
FPS,
but
we
have said earlier it could  be joules per kg or kilo joules per kg, that is the unit right.
So,
we
have
now
come
across
with
all
the
lines
to
be
identified
in
a
psychrometric
chart
right
right.
So,
then
let
us
have
all
the
lines
how
it
will
be
looking
at.
So,
we
are
drawing
a
bigger
one.
So,
this,
this,
this,
and
this,
right.
So,
our
vertical
lines
are
like
this,
and
they are the temperature lines, right they are the temperature lines.
So,
we
call
it
to
be
temperature
lines
TEMP .
Now ,
the
horizontal
lines
these
lines,
we
call
it
to
be
constant
humidity
line,
right
because
it
is
parallel
to
x
axis,
so,
constant.
So,this
is
called
constant
humidity
line.
So,
constant
humidity
line
we
have
drawn.
Next
is
coming relative humidity lines.
So,
these
are
relative
humidity
lines,
like
that
right.
Next
is
coming
wet
bulb
lines.
So,
these
are
wet
bulb
lines
right
then
enthalpy
lines.
This
is
the
enthalpy
scale
right.
So,
enthalpy
scale
according
to
that
this
is
a
little
angle
different,
than
that
right
enthalpy
lines
are
maybe
40
degree
and
the
other
one
that
is
wet
bulb
lines,
they
are
around
45
degree
roughly ,
like
that
and
all,
not
only
that
the
enthalpy
lines
are
reaching
with
the
scale,
and
the
wet
bulb
line,
that
is
not
going
up
to
the
scale,
that
is
going
up
to
the
saturation line right.
So,
one
more
line
is
still,
I
mean
required
and
they
are
called
volume
lines
and
they
are
as
we
said
around
70
degree
to
75
degree.
These
lines
are
volume
lines.
So,
all
the
lines
we
have
found
out
and
we
have
found
out
how
to
identify
number
1,
dry
bulb
temperature,
number
2,
wet
bulb
temperature,
number
3,
saturation
temperature,
number
4,
relative
humidity ,
number
5,
volume,
number
6,
relative
humidity ,
absolute
humidity
ABS
absolute
humidity ,
and
number
7,
enthalpy .
So,
all
these
we
have
now
found
out
how
to
identify
right?
Next,
if
we
look
at
the
problems,
hopefully
we
can
draw ,
hopefully we can identify as well.  We can proceed with the problem.
If
you
are
not
able
to
understand,
then
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
solve
problems,
but
as
I
told
you
that,
it
is
not
so
great
by
which
you
will
not
be
able
to
identify ,
or
do,
only
you
need
to
practice.
So,
if
you
practice
you
will
be
able
to
solve
the
problems
right.
For
example,
this,
the
room,
where
we
are
sitting,
it
has
one
initial
temperature,
that
is,
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
and
it
also
has
a
wet
bulb
temperature
right.
Suddenly ,
you
add
some heat to it. So, both, the dry and wet bulb temperatures will  be changing.
So,
from
this
psychrometrics,
can't
you
find
out
what
are
the
new
set
of
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperatures?
or
others
because,
we
said,
if
you
remember ,
we
said
that
if
we
know
two
property
values,
out
of
the
7.
What
were
those
7?
One
was
dry
bulb,
one
was
wet
bulb,
one
was
saturation
temperature,
one
was
relative
humidity ,
one
was
absolute
humidity
and
other
one
was
volume,
and
the
last
one
was
enthalpy .
So,
out
of
these
7
properties,
if
two
are
known
then,
we
can
find
out
the
state
point
1,
which
is
thermodynamically
in
equilibrium
right.
So,
if
we
again,
if
we
have
this
right.
So,
if
we
know ,
out
of
dry
bulb,
wet
bulb,
saturation
temperature,
relative
humidity ,
absolute
humidity
and
volume
and
enthalpy ,
out
of
these
7,
if
we
know
two
properties,
right
say
dry
bulb,
and
relative
humidity ,
You
are
said,
your
dry
bulb
is
35
degree
centigrade
and
relative humidity is 70 percent right.
Then,
we
can,
then
this
is
a
state
point
1,
S
t
a
t
e
state
point
1.
So,
this
is
the
state
point1,
where
the
point
is
saying,
that
is
temperature
is
35
degree
centigrade,
and
relative
humidity
is
70
percent.
So,
we
draw
the
70
percent
relative
humidity .
This
is
100
and
this
is
70
percent,
right,
and
we
said
our
dry
bulb
temperature
is
35
degree,
say
this
is
35
degree.
Then
a
vertical
line
intersecting
this
70
percent
relative
humidity
is
the
state
point
1,
which
has
35
degree
as
dry
bulb
and
70
percent
relative
humidity ,
as
relative
humidity .
So,
we
could
identify
state
point
1,
right.
Similarly ,
say
we
have
given,
we
have
been
given
one
absolute
humidity ,
right
say
point
0
0
1,
and
that
is
this
point,
and
we
are
given,
say
a
volume,
say
as
we
have
shown
earlier ,
volume
say
13.8.
So,
the
line
of
the
volume,
these were the volume lines.
So,
13.8
line,
if
it
is
there,
then,
when
it
is
moving
like
this,
intersecting
with
the
point,
this
is
called
the
state
point
2,
right.
Now
to
go
from
this
point
to
that
point,
you
have
to
be
following
certain
rules.
It
is
not
just
like
that
you
will
be
going
like
this,
or
if
it
is
here,
you
will
be
going,
just
like
this,
you
have
to
follow
the
procedure,
and
those
procedures
will
come
across
with
the
solution
of
the
problems
right.
So,
next
class,
we
will
try
to
solve
some
problems,
so
that,
you
are
acquainted
with
the
psychroetric,
and
you never do any thing wrong ok.
So,
with
this,
we
conclude
today's
class.
Time
is
up.
Thank
you
for
listening.
Thank
you.
