Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
Good
morning.
If
you
remember
that
in
the
previous
class,
we
had
said
about
the
fluid
flow
through
pipe.
Why
we
have
said?
Because,
in
refrigeration
also,
the
refrigerants,
they
are
also
liquid.
So,
they
will
be
also
flowing.
So,
a
little
of
that,
which
of
course,
had
come
off,
it
is
not
that,
suddenly ,
I
had
stated
as
I
told
you
in
the
beginning,
that
whenever
a
new
thing
will
come,
I
will
try
to
explain
as
much
as
I
can,
so
that
it
becomes
convenient
for
you,
you
can
recapitulate,
you
can
you
can
brush
up
your
past
memory
etc,
for
which
I
had
said.
So,
let
us
now
continue
where
we
started,
that
is
the
basics of thermodynamics, right.
It
is
a
big
one,
it
will
take
a
little
time
because
the
basic
of
thermodynamic
is
a
little
very
high.
Now ,
the
point
where
we
stopped
in
the
last
thermodynamic
class,
if
you
recall
that
we
were
saying
about
equilibrium,
and
I
gave
some
example
also
right.
So,
this
is
one
example
which
is
absolutely
understandable,
that
what
you
are
doing?
You
are
taking,
1
kg
of
a
gas
having
specific
heat
of
1
kilo
joule
per
kg
per
kelvin
that
is
kept
in
an
insulated
cylindrical
container
at
an
uniform
temperature
of
say,
30
degree
centigrade.
These
are,
these
numbers
are
absolutely
to
make
you
understand
right,
it
is
fictitious
number , just to make you understand.
So,
we
have
taken
1
kg
of
a
gas
having
a
specific
heat
of
1
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin
at
30
degree
centigrade
in
one
insulated
cylindrical
container
right.
Now ,
if
suddenly
10
kilo
joules
of
heat
is
added
to
the
cylinder ,
at
one
corner
of
the
cylinder ,
for
example,
I
hope
it
works,
ok.
For
example,
if
say
this
is
the
cylinder
ok,
if
this
is
the
cylinder ,
and
we
have
1
kg
of
gas
and
it
is
insulated
right.
Now ,
we
are
suddenly
adding
10
kilo
joules
of
heat
to
one
corner ,
say
this
corner
right
and
then
what
happens?
What
did
we
do?
We
have
added
10
kilo
joules
of
heat
at
one
corner
of
the
cylinder .
We
have
said
it
to
be
say,
left corner , it can be in right corner , it can be bottom any  side.
So,
we
have
added
some
heat
and
remove
the
source
after
adding.
Now ,
this
will
increase
the
temperature
of
the
gas
at
that
point
where
the
heat
was
supplied
right,
so
that,
the
kinetic
energy
of
those
molecules
of
the
gas
will
increase.
So,
at
this
time
the
kinetic
energy
being
high,
the
molecules
of
the
gas
will
start
moving
randomly
right.
So,with
the
elapse
of
some
time,
the
kinetic
energy
of
the,
we
said
left
corner
of
the
cylinder
will
be
transferred,
to
all
the
molecules
of
the
gas
and
eventually
the
temperature
of
the
gas
at
every
place
in
the
container
will
also
increase
right.
And
this
will
become
uniform
after some time, it will take some time of course, it just  cannot be instantly .
Yes,
there
are
many
systems
which
may
be
instantly
done,
but
in
this
typical
example
it
will
take
little
time,
that
is
why
we
are
saying
that
with
the
elapse
of
time
this
will
increase
the
internal
energy
of
the
gases,
all
around
and
say,
temperature
of
40
degree
centigrade
is
achieved
all
around.
This
condition
is
said
to
be
a
new
state
point
of
equilibrium,
and
this
state
of
equilibrium
is
sufficient
to
determine
the
heat
transfer
in
the
gas
and
thermodynamic
properties
are
also
available,
or
you
can
find
out
at
that
state
point,
when
it
is
under
equilibrium
at
40
degree
centigrade
right.
So,
what
did
you
say
in
equilibrium?
We
said,
we
have
taken
one
cylindrical
box
and
there
it
is
insulated
and
we
have
put
1
kg
of
some
gas
and
having
some
specific
heat
say,
1
kilo
joules
per
kg,
as
we
said
per
kelvin,
and
we
have
added
at
one
corner ,
some
quantity
of
heat,
say
10
kilo
joules
of
heat.
Similarly ,
it
was
at
30
degree
centigrade
all
around
in
the
entire
cylinder .
Now ,
after
adding
this
10
kilo
joules
of
heat,
it
has
become
the
kinetic
energy
of
the
gas
molecules have increased.
So,
they
have,
from
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases,
we
know
that
they
will
move
randomly
to
all
directions,
exchanging
the
energy
with
the
other
molecules,
and
thereby ,
after
sometime,
not
instantly ,
after
sometime,
if
we
see,
we
will
see
that
the
entire
gas
has
achieved
the
temperature
of
say
40
degree
centigrade
and
the
former
one
where
it
was
30
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
when
we
achieved
40
degree
centigrade,
these
are
the
two
state
points
right,
these
are
two
state
points,
one
state
point
was
at
30
degree
centigrade,
which
was
under
equilibrium
at
that
temperature,
and
another
is
40
degree
centigrade,
and
which
is
at
equilibrium
at
that
temperature.
So,
these
are,
the
two
state
points,
where
all
the
properties,
thermodynamic
properties,
you
can
find
out,
you
can
determine,
you
can
know
right.
We
have
not
come
to
psychrometry ,
after
this
class
we
will
go
to
psychrometry ,
there
you
will
be
coming
across
more
in
that,
right.
So,
we
call
it
to
be
at
equilibrium, right, ok.
Now ,
these
properties
of
thermodynamic
equilibrium
gas
molecules
which
was
there
right.
So,
if
it
is
a
gas
the
temperature
and
pressure,
temperature
and
volume
or
pressure
and
volume
are
required
to
be
fixed
by
the
thermodynamic
state.
As
we
said,
point
one
was
30
degree
centigrade,
obviously ,
pressure
was
atmospheric
pressure
we
did
not
say
anything
about
pressure
and
at
40
degree
centigrade,
when
another
state
point
came
up.
So,
they
are
also
at
equilibrium
at
40
degree
centigrade
at
standard
pressure
rather
we
have
not
changed
pressure.
So,
we
need
to
know
either
pressure
temperature
or
temperature volume or pressure volume to  know the thermodynamic state points right.Now ,
there
are
two
types
of
systems.
So,
one
is
called
closed
system
and
another
is
called
open
system
right.
So,
these
two
types
of
systems,
in
the
space
is
identified
for
consideration
of
any
analysis.
Now ,
we
also
define
one
terminology
that
is
called
control
volume.
Now ,
control
volume
we
tell
that
where
the
boundary
of
the
system
is
called
system boundary  or control volume.
Whatever
is
outside
this
boundary
is
called
surroundings.
There
are
two
types
of
systems
in
thermodynamics,
one
as
we
said
closed
and
another
is
open.
For
example,
if
we
say
that
this
is
a,
say
this
one
exactly
this
black
right
beyond
my
beyond
me,
if
we
tell
that
this
is
a
control
volume
right
this
is
the
control
volume
anything,
beyond
this
is
the
surrounding,
anything,
the
entire
world
or
universe
is
the
surrounding.
So,
as
we
said
that
let
us
take
one
control
volume.
So,
this
is
the
control,
of
course,
if
we
take
three
dimensional
then
it
becomes
a
ball
kind
of
thing,
So,
if
that
be
a
system
then
rest
of
the
world, rest of the universe is known as surrounding  right.
So,
within
the
control
volume,
whatever
is
happening
that
is
our
consideration,
may
not
be
all
the
time
what
is
in
the
surrounding,
right,
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
and
this
is
true
for
closed
system.
If
the
system
is
closed,
this
one
is
a
closed
system
right.
So,
if
the
system
is
closed
then
this,
but
this
can
be
also
open
system,
right
as
we
said
there
are
two
types
of
systems,
one
is
closed
and
another
is
open
as
you
see
from
this
that
we
have
taken
one,
we
have
taken
one
control
volume
right
and
this
is
the
system
boundary
right
this
is
the
system
boundary .
And
if
we
put
Q
quantity
of
heat
then
W
quantity
of
work
is
available. You are giving heat Q.
So,
you
will
get
work,
right.
If
you
extract
heat,
it
is
the
reverse,
W
quantity
of
work
will
be
available.
So,
this
is
by
the
system
right,
this
work
is
done
by
the
system,
and
you
will
come
across
afterwards,
that,
when
it
is
by
the
system,
we
call
it
to
be
positive
right.
When,
it
is
by
the
system
we
call
it
to
be
positive
and
when
it
is
on
the
system,
if
it
would
have
been
reverse,
like
this
and
if
it
would
have
been
reverse,
like
this,
then
we
would
have
said,
it
is
on
the
system
right.
So,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
by
the
system,   it is positive and on the system it is negative right.
So,
this
is
a
closed
system,
where
you
have
given
Q
quantity
of
heat,
you
got
W
quantity
of
work
right.
And
as
we
said,
it
is
a
positive
quantity ,
because
by
convention,
rather ,
I
should
say,
by
convention
it
is
said,
it
is
taken
always
positive
if
work
is
done
by
the
system,
right.
So,
same
matter ,
at
all
times
if
it
is
there
then,
energy
is
transferred
in
the
form
of
heat
transfer
and
work
occurs
across
its
boundary ,
right
this
is
for
closed
system.
See,
if
we
take
an
open
system,
right
like
this
one,
we
have
taken
an
open
system
ok.
Though this is set point 1, and this is set point 2 right.So,
we
know
all
the
thermodynamic
properties
and
other
physical
properties
like
m
dot
or
m
1
dot,
u
1.
u
1
we
have
not
said
yet,
we
will
say
also,
internal
energy
right.
Then
rho
1
is
the
density ,
V
1
is
the
volume,
and
z
1
is
the
height,
and
here
it
is
m
2
is
the
mass,
u
2
is
the
internal
energy,
rho
2
is
the
density ,
v
2
is
the
velocity ,
and
z
2
is
the
height,
right,
height
or
distance
whatever
you
call.
So,
if
we
see
this,
then
by
open
system,
you
are
allowing
this
m
dot
quantity ,
m
1
dot
quantity ,
of
mass
to
flow
whose
all
properties
both
physical
and
thermodynamic
properties
are
known.
Then
you
are
getting
at
the
point,
set
point
2,
a
different
mass,
internal
energy,
then
density ,
then
velocity ,
and
at a dif ferent height.
So,
this
is
a
closed
system
right.
Now ,
for
laws
of
thermodynamics,
4
empirical
principles
such
as
zeroth
law,
first
law,
second
law
and
third
law
of
thermodynamics
are
known
right.
In
thermodynamics,
there
are
4
laws
zeroth
law,
first
law,
second
law
and
third
law,
these
4
laws
are
known
and
these
cannot
be
proved,
but
no
exceptions
to
these
have
been
observed
as
on
date.
So,
they
define
thermodynamic
properties,
such
as
zeroth
law,
defines
temperature,
zeroth
law
defines
temperature,
first
law
defines
internal
energy,
second
law
defines
entropy
and
the
third
law
defines
absolute
0
temperature
cannot
be
reached
or
achieved
right.
So,
these
4
laws
will
come
across
in
detail
gradually .
So,
what
you
say
that
in
thermodynamics
there
are
4
laws
zeroth,
first,
second
and
third
law,
and
zeroth
law
tells
about
temperature,
first
law
tells
about
internal
energy,
second
law
tells
about
entropy ,
and
third
law
tells
about
absolute
0
cannot
be
achieved
right.
Then,
we
talk
about
zeroth
law.
Then,
if
we
assume
3
systems
such
as
A,
B,
and
C,
and
if
A
is
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
B,
right,
A
system
is
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
B.
So,
this
is
a
system
A,
this
is
a
system
B
and
this
is
a
system
C
right.
So,
in
all
these
3
systems, in which A is in thermal equilibrium with B.
So,
we
can
write
it,
in
this
way
the
equilibrium
sign
is,
like
this,
A
is
in
equilibrium
with
B
and
A
is
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
B
and
independent
of
shear
logic
right.
This
is
independently ,
shear
in
equilibrium,
thermal
equilibrium
by
shear
logic.
So,
to
exist
in
thermal
equilibriumk
all
the
3
systems,
should
have
some
common
property
such
as
temperature.
Otherwise,
how
can
we
say
whether
A
or
B
or
C,
they
are
in
equilibrium
or
all of them are  in equilibrium. Which is the property , that is temperature, right.
So,
temperature
is
the
common
property
by
which
we
can
say
about
the
equilibrium.
So,
all
the
3
systems,
should
have
the
same
temperature,
to
exist
in
equilibrium
with
each
other .
The
measuring
device
of
thermodynamic
temperature
is
also
to
be
in
equilibrium
right
such
as
thermometer ,
or
any
other
temperature
indicator ,
should
also
be
in
thermalequilibrium
with
the
system.
Otherwise,
suppose,
I
hope,
you
have
seen
that
household
thermometers,
they
are
having
a
probe
or
bulb
like
this.
So,
if
this
bulb
is
not
in
equilibrium with T A or T B or T C, then there will be a dif ference.
So,
to
register
the
temperature,
it
will
be,
that
is
why
you
remember
that,
if
someone
falls
sick,
then
both
doctors
or
your
senior
people
they
say
that
if
we
are
putting
it
into
mouth
or
under
the
arm,
keep
it
for
some
time,
and
that
is
the
time
elapse,
which
you
are
giving,
so
that
the
temperature
is
attained
and
this
can
be
called
thermodynamic
equilibrium
between
the
body
and
the
thermometer ,
which
you
are
using.
Of
course,
nowadays
there
are
many
ways
of
thermometers
have
come
up
even
without
giving
any
body
touch
from
outside
also
the
temperatures
can
be
measured
right,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
them,
we
are
talking
about
those
thermometers,
which
you
are
using
in
your
body
either
in
mouth
or
under
the
arm.
So,
then
that
thermometer
has
to
be
in
equilibrium
with
the
system,
you
are
measuring,
then
only,
you
can
say,
the
temperature
is
so
much.
So,
the
zeroth
law
is
telling
about
the
temperature
of
the
system
right.
So,
with
this
I
think,
we
can
proceed
further ,
with
the
first
law,
second
law
in
the
subsequent
classes,
but
mind
it,
that
equilibrium
concept
which
we
have
given
you,
is
very
much
applicable
all
over
during
this
course
because
thermodynamic
equilibrium,
now
the
moment,
we
call
it,
thermodynamic
equilibrium,
it
is
equilibrium
in
all
state
properties
right.
This
state
properties
in
detail
will
come
across
when
we
are
talking
about
the
psychrometry
that
time,
you
will
see
so
many
thermodynamic
properties
are
also
to
be
known
right.
So,
with
this
let
us
stop
today's
this
class
of
zeroth
law
of
thermodynamics
and we will  proceed to the next one.  Thank you.
