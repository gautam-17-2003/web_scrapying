Pure Substance as Refrigerant
Good
afternoon
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
friends.
So,
we
were
with
the
ideal
situations,
that
is,
Carnot
Refrigeration
Cycle.
Now ,
we
have
to
come
out
of
that,
we
have
to
come
to
the
real
one,
and
we
start
with
pure
substance,
as
a
refrigerant
right.
Till
now,
in
the
Carnot,
we
have
said
repeatedly ,
that,
it
is
irrespective
of
the
substance
taken,
but
in
reality ,
when
we
are
in
the
actual
cycle,
then,
we
see
that,
the
refrigerant
plays
an
important
role
right.
So,
we
are
now
doing
that,
what
the
refrigeration
cycle
will
behave,
when
we
are
considering
pure
substance,
as
the
refrigerant.
Now ,
that
pure
substance,
as
refrigerant,
and
in
the
wet
compression
cycle,
if
gas
is
used,
as
a
working
substance,
isothermal heat transfer are not possible right.
So,
that
an
isothermal
heat
transfer
meaning
what?
Say,
you
are
having
a
heat
transferred
through
this,
but,
the
thing
has
to
be
isothermal,
that
is,
constant
temperature
right.
So,
it
is
very
difficult
to
maintain
such
kind
of
thing,
and
is
not
possible
without
a
compressor
or
an
expander .
So,
isothermal
heat
transfer
means,
the
refrigerant
condenses,
during
heat
rejection,
and
boils
during
heat
absorption.
This
means,
the
heat
transfer processes involve latent heat transfer only , no sensible heat.
I
hope,
you
know ,
what
is
the
sensible,
and
what
is
the
latent
heat.
Latent
heat
is
that,
where,
phase
is
getting
transferred,
and
sensible
heat
is
that,
where,
there
is
no
phase
change.
Phase
change,
I
mean,
it
is
solid
to
liquid
to
gas,
anywhere,
any
phase
change,
solid
to
liquid,
one
phase
change,
liquid
to
gas
is
another
phase
change.
So,
everywhere,
the
latent
heat
is
used,
but,
the
heat
transfer
process
involves,
in
this
case,
is
the
latent
heat
transfer
only,
and
the
process
is
also
reversible
right.
So,
this
is
this
cycle,
or
this
system can be said as reversed Carnot refrigeration system, with wet vapour compression.
So,
we
have
said
in
the
Carnot,
what
is
the
difficulty
of
wet
vapour
compression.
So,
here,
as
the
pure
substance,
let
us
take
first,
wet
vapour
compression.
That
means,
as
we
can
figure
out
that,
we
will
have
a
T-S
diagram,
where
the
dome
is
like
this,
say.
So,
here,
1,
here
2,
here
3,
here
4.
So,
this
kind
of
T-S
diagram,
we
will
be
having
right,
in
which
we
will
have
one
compressor ,
from
point
1
to
point
2,
then
one
condenser ,
under ,
Tc,
that
is,
isothermal
condition,
it
will
reject
heat,
right,
to
the
ambient,
and
it
will
cometo
point
3,
then,
under
turbine
expansion,
it
will
go
to
the
point
4,
where
it
will
enter
the
evaporator ,
at
constant
temperature,
Te,
right.
And
heat
will
be
given
to
this,
equivalent
to Qe, right, and this was Qc.
So,
if
we
have
this,
then,
we
can
say
that,
the
process
involves
1
to
2,
that
is,
isentropic
compression,
carried
out
at
an
isentropic
compressor ,
then
2
to
3,
is
isothermal
heat
rejection,
by
condensation,
carried
out
in
an
heat
exchanger ,
and
that
is
called
condenser .
Then,
process
3
to
4,
is
isentropic
expansion,
carried
out
in
a
turbine,
or
in
an
expansion
device,
and
process
4
to
1,
that
is,
isothermal
heat
absorption,
by
boiling,
carried
out
in
a
heat
exchanger ,
called
evaporator .
So,
all
the
inlet
of
point
2,
and
exit
of
point
3,
the
state
of
the
refrigerant
is
saturated
vapour
and
liquid.
So,
this
we
can
see,
perhaps,
from
a
TS
diagram.
So,
this
is
that
TS
diagram,
where
we
are
first
considering
wet
compression
right,
and
by
this,
we
can
say
that,
both
wet
compression
and
expansion
has
practical
difficulties,
which
we
have
said,
repeatedly ,
in
the
Carnot,
and
here
also,
since
we
have
started with the wet compression, that, it has practical dif ficulties and disadvantages.
So,
step
1
to
2,
this
is
that
step,
1
to
2,
is
called
wet
compression,
since
whole
of
the
process
occurs
in
the
mixture
region,
where,
liquid
droplets
of
refrigerant
are
also
present.
So,
this
is
a
TS
diagram
of
reverse
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle,
with
wet
vapour
right.
So,
we
can
say
that,
a
typical
high
reciprocating
compressor ,
a
high
speed
reciprocating
compressor ,
has
a
rpm
of
say,
around
1440.
This
is
a
typical
number ,
it
could
be
1400
or
1500,
like
that,
and
due
to
the
high
rpm,
the
compression
strokes,
takes
place,
in
less
than
0.02
seconds.
So,
it
is
taking
place
in
less
than
0.02
seconds,
which
is
less
than
half
of
one
cycle.
So,
what
do
you
mean
by
cycle,
that
we
started
from
0.1
to
0.2
to
0.3
to
0.4
and
back
to
0.1,
the
time
taken
is
the
cycle
time,
right.
So,
we
can
say
that,
the
high
speed
compressor ,
reciprocating,
having
high
rpm
around
1440
or
1500,
and
the
time
required
for
stroke
of
a
compression
is
0.02
second,
and
is
less
than
half
of
one
cycle.
So,
that
means,
by
one
stroke,
it
will
be
completing
half
of
the
cycle,
like
this,
sorry , half of  the cycle like this, right.
So,
what
about
the
whole
cycle?
So,
that
will
be
required
more
time.
So,
this
small
time
is
not
sufficient
for
all
liquids
to
evaporate.
In
the
T-S
diagram,
then,
state
of
compression
is
shown
to
be
a
saturated
state
right.
Let
us
go
back
to
that,
this
was
that
ok.
This
is
that
saturated
state,
sorry ,
this
is
that
saturated
state,
this
one,
this
is
under
that
saturation line.
So,
is
the
saturated
state.
Now ,
this
small
time
is
not
sufficient
for
all
liquids
to
evaporate
and
in
the
T-S
diagram,
then
state
of
compression
is
shown
to
be
in
saturated
state,
which,
may
be
on
the
average,
a
mixture
of
some
superheated
vapour
and
some
left
over
liquid
droplets.
The
average
piston
velocity
is,
2
to
3
meter
per
second,
averagepiston
velocity
is
2
to
3
meter
per
second,
and
the
outlet
valve
passage
area
may
be
one-sixth
of
the
cross
sectional
area
of
a
cylinder ,
of
the
cylinder .
Whereas,
the
refrigerant
outlet
velocity
will
be
around
12
to
18
meter
per
second.
It
is
very
high,
right
12
to
18
meter
per
second.
The
liquid
refrigerant
droplets
coming
out
of
such
a
high
velocity ,
hit
the
compressor
valves,
like
bullet,
and
damage
it.
This,
we
have
also
said
earlier , if you remember correctly , then, we had also said the same thing earlier , right.
So,
this
is
true
for
vapour
compression,
wherever
it
be,
whatever ,
be
the
cycle.
So,
moreover ,
the
liquid
refrigerant
has
more
solubility
for
the
lubricant,
another
negative
point
for
the
Carnot
cycle.
Carnot
refrigeration
system,
that,
the
liquid
carries
with
it
the
lubricant
used
for
the
compressor ,
right.
So,
the
solubility
of
the
refrigerant
being
high
for
the
lubricant
oil,
then
it
is
also
carried
out
by
the
liquid
refrigerant,
right,
than
the
vapour
refrigerant
of
course,
so
the
liquid
refrigerant
droplets
will
dissolve
more
lubricating
oil
present
in
the
walls
of
the
cylinder .
This
will
certainly
increase,
the
wear
and tear of the compressor , this also we have said earlier .
In
the
older
models
of
compressors,
the
RPM
used
to
be
around
100
to
400,
which
gives
sufficient
time
for
heat
transfer
to
occur
to
evaporate
the
liquid
refrigerant
present
at
the
inlet.
So,
the
wet
compression
cycle
is
primarily
of
academic
interest.
So,
wet
compression
cycle
is
primarily
of
academic
interest.
The
moral
of
this
discussion
is
that,
we
have
to
use
dry
compression
with
high
speed
reciprocating
compressors,
right.
So,
we
started
with
wet
compression,
and
we
saw
that,
not
feasible,
as
it
was
also
same
with
the
Carnot
system,
right.
So,
we
have
shown
it,
then
we
come
to
standard
reversed
Carnot cycle, right.
So,
there
we
see
that,
compressor
inlet
state
is,
saturated
vapour ,
what
we
have
shown
here
is
that,
this
is
the
T
s
diagram,
right.
So,
we
have
this
vapour
dome,
right
and
we
started
with
the
point
1,
here,
which,
is
the
saturated
vapour
state.
Then,
we
went
vertical,
that
is,
isentropic,
this
is,
T
s,
and
then
an
isothermal,
and
from
there,
to
the
point,
and
then
from
that
point,
to
this,
and
from
here
back
to
the
point
1.
So,
this
is
point
1,
this
is
point
2,
this
is
point
3,
and
if
this
is
point
2
and
this
is
point
2
prime,
point
3,
and this is point 4, back to 1 ok.  This is what is reflecting here right.
So,
we
are
getting
1
to
2
being
an
isentropic
compression
process,
that
occurs
in
superheated
state,
this
one,
right,
that
occurs
in
superheated
state.
This
is
the
T
s
diagram
of
reversed
Carnot
cycle,
with
saturated
vapour
right.
Then,
we
can
now
see,
the
other ,
that
step
2
to
2a,
right
step
2
to
a
actually ,
this
should
have
been
2,
and
this
should
have
been
‘a’
ok.
So,
step
2
to
‘a’
is
isothermal
heat
rejection.
However ,
just
like
the
gas
cycle,
the
pressure,
during
the
part
2-a
increases,
that
is,
Pa
equal
to
Pc,
is
greater
than
P2,
and
this
therefore,
so,
it
is
therefore,
it
requires
an
isothermal
compressor ,
and
‘a’
to
3is
isothermal
heat
rejection,
3
to
4
is
isentropic
expansion,
carried
out
in
a
turbine,
or
in
an
expansion
device
and
process
4
to
1
is
isothermal
heat
absorption
by
evaporation,
carried out in an evaporator .
So,
this
is
the
standard
reversed
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle
right.
So,
we
can
say,
now,
that,
if
we
analyze,
the
cycle,
then,
applying
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
we
can
say,
to
the
components
used,
that
is,
all
components
individually ,
assuming
a
steady
state,
we
can
say
that,
in
the
step
1,
that
is,
process
1
to
2,
is
isentropic
compression.
So,
assuming,
there
is
no
change
in
kinetic
and
potential
energies,
that
is,
delta
Ke
and
delta
Pe
is
0,
or
negligible.
The
process
being
isentropic,
it
means
that
the
process
is
adiabatic,
and
reversible,
and
hence,
Q
is
equal
to
0.
If
W
isentropic
is
the
work,
W,
isentropic
is
the
suffix,
if,
W
isentropic
is
the
work
input
to
the
isentropic
compressor ,
then,
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
reduces
to
minus
W
isentropic,
is
equal
to
m
dot
into
h
2
minus
h
1.
The
specific
work
input
in
terms
of
per
unit
mass
flow
rate
is
minus
w
isentropic,
is
equal
to
h
2
minus
h
1.
Here
it
was
capital
W,
for
the
entire
mass,
here
it
is
small
w,
per
unit
mass,
right.
This,
we
have
been
saying
repeatedly .
The
negative
sign
indicates
that
the
work
is
done
on
the
system,
since
the
right
hand
side
of
the
positive,
here,
since
the
right
hand
side
is
positive,
we
can
write
that
w
isentropic,
within
the
domain,
right,
is
equal
to
h
2
minus
h
1
right.
Now ,
we
can
say,
now,
that,
step
2
is
the
process,
2
to
‘a’,
isothermal
compression.
So,
if
it
is,
isothermal
compression,
then
work
done
on
the
isothermal
compressor ,
is
W
iso,
and
heat
rejected
by
the
compressor ,
is
Q
reverse,
and
both of which are negative.
Then,
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
says,
that
Q
iso
minus
W
iso
is
equal
to
m
dot
h
a
minus
h
2,
and
this
process
is
considered
to
be
reversible
therefore,
Q
reversible
is
also
T
d
s,
which,
we
have
seen
earlier ,
right.
So,
we
can
write
that,
Q
isentropic
is
equal
to
m
dot
T
c
into
s
2
minus
s
a
and
that
is,
m
dot,
area
2
a
c
d
2,
if
we
go
back,
if
we
go
back
to
that,
we
can
say
2
a
c
d
2,
is
the,
sorry ,
so,
this
is
the
s,
and
not
here,
the
previous
one
here,
this
is
2-
a,
right.
So,
2
a,
then
3
b
d,
if
I
am
not
mistaken,
let
us
look
into
that,
we
have to change it.  So, let us look into that, it was 2 a c d 2, right.
So,
the
same
thing
we
have
said,
2
a,
this
is
2
a,
then
2
a
c,
this
part,
right.
So,
this
is
2,
this
is
a,
this
is
c,
this
is
d,
and
back
to
2.
So,
this
part
is
the
area,
that
m
dot
area
2
a
c
d
2,
right.
Now ,
if
we
come
to
rewriting.
So,
minus
W
iso
is
T
c
into
s
2
minus
s
a
minus,
H
2
minus
H
a,
and
integrating,
T
d
s
equal
to
d
h
minus
V
d
p,
along
the
process
2
to
a,
this result can also be obtained only if minus V d p is W is used for an open system.
Therefore,
W
isentropic
is
minus
between
0.22
a
V
d
p
is
equal
to
integral
of
T
2
to
a
Td
s
and
minus
integral
of
2
to
a
d
h.
So,
this
is
T
c
into
S
a
minus
S
2
minus
H
a
minus
H
2
right.
So,
we
can
say
that,
since,
it
is
the
work
done
on
the
system,
therefore,
it
is
negative,
we
also
said
many
times,
that,
if
work
is
done
on
the
system,
then
it
is
negative,
and
if
work
is
done
by
the
system,
then
it
is
positive,
this
we
have
said
many
times,
right.
So,
we
can
then
say
that
step
3
is
process
a
to
3,
right,
and
process
to
a
to
3,
if
you
remember , it was like this, that, this was a and this is 3, right.
So,
process
a
to
3
in
that
T
s
diagram
is
this,
and
considering,
there
is
no
kinetic
and
potential
energy,
and
this
is
equal
to
0,
since,
there
is
no
work
involved
in
this
process,
W
is
equal
to
0.
Therefore,
first
law
reduces
to,
first
law
reduces
to
Q
is
equal
to
rather ,
minus
Q
c
is
equal
to
m
dot
h
a
minus
h
3
minus
m
dot
T
c
into
s
a
minus
s
3.
Since,
a
to
3
is
isothermal,
and
isobaric
process,
and
using
T
d
s,
is
d
h
minus
V
d
p.
So,
we
can
write,
then
d
H
is
equal
to
T
d
s
because
d
p
is
0,
there
is
no
pressure
difference
between
a
to
3.
So,
integrating
along
a
to
3,
we
can
write,
from
T
s
diagram,
that
h
a
minus
h
3
is
equal
to
between
a
3
to
an
integral
T
c
d
s
and
that
means,
T
c
into
s
a
minus
s
3,
that
means,
area
under
3
b
c
a
3,
we
will
just
show
this,
and
then
obviously ,
time
is
up
we
will go  to the next for step 4.
Now ,
if
you
remember ,
what
we
said,
we
said,
it
is
area
3
b
c
a
3,
right
area
3
b
c
a
3.
So,
back
to
3
right.
So,
3
is
this
area,
b
is
this
c
is
this,
a
is
this,
and
back
to
3.
So,
this
area
we
are
referring
to
for
the
process
3.
Our
time
is
up
for
today .
So,
I
thank
you
all
for
attending this class. I will continue in the next class for this, ok. Thank you.
