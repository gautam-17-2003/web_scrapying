Cooling Load Calculation Contd.
Good
afternoon.
Good
afternoon,
again
we
are
in
the
class
of
Cooling
Load
Calculation
right.
So,
this
is
a
continuous
class
of
the
previous
class
that
is
Cooling
Load
Calculation.
We
have
said,
there
are
two
types,
one
is
unsteady ,
one
is
steady
state,
right.
Now ,
when
we
are
calculating,
as
it
is
shown
in
this
figure
that
we
have
a,
say
4
wall
like
this,
right.
This
is
of
course,
2
dimensional,
it
can
be
also
shown
in
3
dimension
and
heat
transfer
is
coming
from
all
the
sides,
right
and
that
is
what
we
are
saying
that
heat
transfer  rate through composite solid, you have to take care.
And
also
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
from
outside
by
air
through
various
surfaces
under
of
course,
various
conditions.
I
give
you
again
one
example
that
couple
of
weeks
or
months
back
there
were
huge
natural
calamities
and
there,
you
have
seen
the
air
velocity
was
somewhere
may
be
100
or
80
kilo
meters
per
hour,
right.
Of
course,
that
was
natural
calamity ,
but
that
time
it
was
also
having
some
rain,
it
was
also
providing
a
little
cooling.
We
are
not
talking
about
that
I
am
just
saying
about
your
perception
that
during
that period  the air velocity was somewhere 80 to 100 or 120 kilo meters per hour .
And
suppose
like
today
there
is
no
such
breeze
it
is
almost
steady .
So
the
velocity
could
be
somewhere
5
to
10
kilo
meters
per
hour.
So
obviously ,
if
you
consider
even
say
the
sun,
because
in
India
we
have
plenty
of
sun.
So
if
you
consider
that
the
heating
from
the
sun,
so
considering
the
month
of
May
or
April
and
considering
the
month
of
November
or
December
obviously ,
the
situation
is
not
different,
is
same,
right.
And
another
example
of
various
surfaces
here
the
one
which
we
have
given
you
that
blue
colored
and
it is of course, two dimensional.
Suppose
the
top
one
is
the
roof
and
the
side
one
is
the
sidewalls,
right.
Now
as
I
said
that
in
the
month
of
April
May
lot
of
air
movement
is
there
because
of
different
reasons.
So,
there
the
velocities
are
very
high.
So
the
roof
will
have,
that
is
a
surface
will
have
one
kind
of
heat
compared
to
that
of
the
sidewalls.
Because,
sidewall's
velocities
will
beinterrupted whereas, the roof top that is free.
So
there
will
be
good
breeze.
So
the
resultant
heat
transfer
coefficient
also
will
differ.
So
that
will
give
you
some
idea
obviously ,
under
which
condition
what
could
be
tentative
heat
transfer
coefficient
to
have
the
idea
may
not
be
exact,
but
to
have
the
idea,
right.
So
what
we
are
doing?
We
are
now
calculating
the
heat
load,
right.
So
in
this
square,
how
much heat is being conducted or conveyed, right.
So
generally
conduction,
convection
and
radiation
these
three
are
the
mode
of
heat
transfer .
As
we
are
talking
about
that
this
is
a
solid
boundary ,
right.
Inside
we
have
the
material
to
be
stored,
right.
So
leaving
this
material,
if
we
assume
that
there
is
nothing,
it
is
empty ,
right,
then
what
we
see,
we
see
that
the
heat
which
is
coming
from
the
outside
to
the
room
or
wall,
which
we
have
shown
here
is
due
to
the
resultant
conductivity
of
the
material
and
that
we
calculate
through
m
dot
C
p
delta
T
right.
So
m
dot
C
p
delta
T
is
the
heat
and
this
C
p
is
the
resultant
C
p
of
the
wholem
here
you
have
one
heat
transfer
coefficient,
here
you
have
one
conductivity ,
this
side
also
you
have
one
heat transfer coef ficient.
So
everything
put
together
will
make
one
U,
as
you
know ,
so
this
U
will
be
1
by
h
1
plus
1
by
k
by
your
area
A
x,
right
that
heat
transfer
coefficient
not
heat
transfer
coefficient,
your,
the
Fourier
law,
right,
is
dT
dx
A,
right,
q
is
equal
to
A
into
k
into
dT
dx
with
a
negative
right.
So,
that,
if
we
put
here,
so,
that
will
be
coming
here
and
plus
1
by
h
2
another .
So
all
these
different
heat
transfer
equations
can
be
utilized
for
finding
out
the
cooling
load
right.
So
if
we
go
to
the
next
slide,
if
we
go
to
the
next
slide,
oh,
I
have
to
erase
it,
because
surface
remains.
So
this,
it
is
saying
that
the
unsteady
state
refrigeration
load
corresponds
to
the
load
of
the
product
to
be
stored
till
it
reaches
a
steady storage temperature, which I have  been saying, right, from the beginning.Both
sensible
and
latent
heat
are
to
be
considered
and
for
the
heat
load
calculation
this
latent
heat
and
sensible
heat
are
to
be
known.
The
heat
of
fusion
of
ice
is
335
kilo
joules
per
kg
or
as
we
have
given
0.335
mega
joules
per
kg.
So
when
a
change
of
phase
is
involved
here
there
is
some
red
marking
when
this
change
of
phase
is
involved
the
latent
heat
of
water
must
also
be
considered,
right.
So
this
is
as
far
as
unsteady
load,
right,
and
we have talked about the steady load also.
So
that
as
we
have
already
said,
I
have
already
said
that
depending
on
the
surfaces
the
heat
transfer
coefficients
are
also
different.
In
this
case
it
is
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin,
right,
it
is
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin.
So
that
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin
should
be
known
for
different
surfaces.
Some
examples
we
have,
I
have
given,
that
is,
if
it
is
inside
the
wall,
steel
air
in
the
room,
where
you
are
sitting,
if
there
is
no
fan,
no
air
conditioner ,
then
the
air
can
be
asked
or
air
can
be
can
be
assumed
to
be
steel
air.
So
there
the
heat
transfer coef ficient is very low , minimum, it is somewhere around 8.
5
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin,
right.
So
if
it
is
outside
wall
or
roof
when
wind
is
also
blowing,
here
we
have
given
at
the
rate
of
say
24
kilometer
per
hour.
If
it
is
24
kilometer
per
hour,
it
is
a
reasonable
figure
because
it
is
not
like
the
storm
as
we
gave
example
of
80,
100,
120
kilometers,
but
24,
25,
20
kilometers
per
hour
is
a
normal
one.
So
there,
in
that
case,
and
you
see,
over
the
roof,
that
means,
you
have
a
plane
over
which
the
air
is
blowing right and it is 33.5 watt per meter square Kelvin.
Whereas,
outside
the
wall
or
roof,
when
wind
is
blowing
around
12
kilometer
per
hour,
as
we
said
that
when
there
is
no
breeze,
it
is
7,
8,
10.
So
12
kilo
meter
per
hour
is
the
air
velocity
and
it
is
also
being
considered
for
the
roof
only.
Then
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
is
around
22.7
kilowatt
rather
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin.
Other
cases
could
be
like
horizontal
surface
and
you
have
still
air,
and
upward
heat
flow,
surface
is
horizontal
and
you
are
saying
that
you
have
still
air
and
the
heat
flow
is
from
bottom
to
top.
That
means,
top
is
cold
and
from
bottom
the
hot
air
is
going
to
the
top.
In
that
case
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
is
9.7
watt
per
meter
square
Kelvin.
And
lastly ,
another
one
example
is
horizontal
surface
still
air,
but
downward
heat
flow,
right.
So
instead
of
this
is the horizontal surface, inside is still air and it is flowing, it is  flowing downward.
In
that
case
it
is
even
lower ,
6.25,
right.
So,
it
is
even
lower
6.25.
So,
whatever
be
we
have
given
some
example,
because
we
want
that
you
should
have
some
idea
about
the
numbers that heat transfer coef ficient numbers, as at the moment you have  seen it is 8.
5,
33.5,
22.7,
9.7,
9.6.25
like
that,
right.
There
are
many
other
examples
also
where
the
heat
transfer
coefficients
are
even
much
higher ,
right.
Like
if
you
have,
say
liquid
nitrogen
which
is
again
another
coolant,
there
the
latent
heat
is
around
200
kilo
joules
per
kg
and
the
heat
transfer
coefficient,
depending
on
the
condition,
is
around
170
watts
per meter square Kelvin, right.
So,
it
all
depends.
So,
what
we
need,
we
need
to
know
the
surface
and
the
heat
transfer
coefficient.
Then
I
would
like
to
explain
that
we
said,
that
composite
medium,
right,
that
composite
medium
meaning
as
you
can
see
that
here
we
have
given
1,
2,
3
right.
So,
there
may
be
n
number
such
insulations
or
some
other
right.
So,
they,
if
you
add
them
up
you
can
find
out
the
resultant
conductivity .
How ,
this
is
called
thermal
resistance
concept.
Like
electrical
resistance
if
you
have
one
voltage,
here
another
voltage,
here,
there
is
a
resistance
in
the
electrical
resistance
and
you
can
find
out
how
much
voltage
or
current
is
going
on.
Here
also
instead
of
that
this
is
called
thermal,
this
is
here
one
temperature,
here
another
temperature
and
you
have
a
resistance,
you
can
have
one
or
n
number ,
as
here
you
are
seeing
we
have
1,
2,
3,
4,
5
right,
5
numbers
of
resistances
and
we
can
have
different
situations.
In
this
case,
on
this
side
we
are
having,
some
fluid
is
flowing
at
a
temperature
of
T
a
and
h
a
and
here
another
fluid
is
flowing
at
a
temperature
of
T
b
and
h
b
right.
So,
the
quantity
of
heat
flowing
is
q
through
them,
it
is
flowing
according
to
their
resistances
and
ultimately
it
is
coming
out
as
q,
right.
So,
we
have
taken
for
the
first
one
is,
temperature
at
the
surface
is
T
1
it's
conductivity
is
k
1
and
it's
thickness
is
l
1,
since
it
is only one dimensional heat transfer .
Similarly
the
second
one
temperature
at
the
surface
is
T
2
conductivity
is
k
2
and
the
length
or
thickness
of
the
material
is
l
2
and
third
one
the
temperature
at
the
surface
is
T
3
it's
conductivity
is
k
3
and
the
thickness
is
l
3
coming
to
the
surface
at
T
4
and
then
it
isdissipating
q
to
the
ambient
where
your
ambient
condition
is
T
b
and
h
b,
temperature
is
T
b
and
heat
transfer
coefficient
is
h
b
right.
So,
in
this
situation,
if
we
look
at
now,
what
we
are
doing,
that
the
q
quantity
of
heat
is
flowing
and
the
resistances
are,
you
know
any
flow
is
function
of
the
driving
force
and
the
resistance,
it
is
directly
proportional
to
the
driving
force
and
inversely
proportional
to
the
resistance.
So,
if
q
is
the
flowing
quantity
in
terms
of
heat
then
the
driving
forces
are
for
the
first
one,
it
is
T
a
minus
T
1
and
the
resistance
is
R
a
that
must
be
equal,
because
the
same
q
is
flowing,
it
is
not
that
you
have
in
slab
1
1
q
in
slab
2
another
q
that
is
not,
you
have
the
same
q
which
is
flowing
throughout.
So,
what
we
are
doing,
we
are
doing
that
q
quantity
of
heat
is
flowing
through
first
resistance
was
T
a
minus
T
1
over
R
a,
if
you
remember
that
we
had,
we
had
this
type
of
1
then
2
then
3
like
this.
So,
here
we
are
telling
that
T
a
minus
T
1
by
R
a
is
equal
to
T
1
minus
T
2
by
R
2
is
equal
to
T
2
minus
T
3
by
R
3
is
equal
to
T
3
minus
T 4 by R 4 and that whole is equal  to T 4 minus T b by R b, right.
So,
this
5
q's
are
same,
right,
this
is
called
the
thermal
resistance
concept
and
based
on
the
thermal
resistance,
it
is
done,
right
and
we
have
to
find
out
the
individual
resistances.
So,
individual
resistance
is
R
a,
right
and
that
is
equals
to
1
by
h
a
into
A
is
equal
to
and
then
R
1
is
L
by
A
k
right,
R
1
is
L
by
A
k,
then
R
2
is
L
2
by
A
k,
R
1
is
L
1
by
A
k
1
R
2
is
L
2
by
A
k
2
and
R
a
is
L
3
by
L
3
right
then
the
last
one
R
b
is
1
by
A
h
b
then
the
total
resistance
is
R
if
we
look
at
q
that
is
equal
to
the
total
temperature
difference,
that
is
T
a
minus
T
b
divided
by
R
and
these
are
as
you
have
seen
that
they
were
in
series
right,
they
were
in
series.
So,
this
is
the
flow,
so
these
were
in
series.
So,
that
is
why
the
R
is
added
R
is
equal
to
R
1
plus
R
2
plus
R
3
plus
R
4,
has
many
R,
right.
So,
then
we
find
out
what
is
the
q,
from
there
we
can
also
find
out
what
is
the,
if
you
know
the
q,
what
is
the resultant  k, right this is how the k or equivalent conductivity is also found out.
Thank you.
