Recipr ocating
Compr essor
(Contd.)
Good
afternoon
my
dear
boys
and
girls.
We
are
continuing
with
the
reciprocating
compressor
type
and
typically
in
the
last
class
we
have
come
with
the
ideal
type
of
reciprocating
compressor .
Because,
if
we
know
the
ideal,
then,
we
can
compare
with
the
real
one,
right.
So,
we
are
continuing
with
reciprocating
compressors,
and
that,
today,
we
shall
continue
there.
Work
input
to
the
ideal
compressor ,
earlier,
we
have
done
with
the
equation
number
4,
if
you
remember,
right.
The
total
work
input
to
the
compressor
in
one
cycle
that
can
be
given
as
W
i
d,
right
and
this
is
equal
to
W
DA
plus
W
AB
plus
W
BC,
right.
W
id
=
W
D-A
+
W
A-B
+
W
B-C
…
(5)
Obviously,
where
the
individual
terms,
that
W
DA,
is
work
done
by
the
refrigerant
on
the
piston
during
process
DA,
and
this
is
equal
to
the
area
under
the
line
DA
on
PV
diagram,
and
that
is
equal
to
minus
Pe
into
VA.
W
AB
is
work
done
by
the
piston
on
refrigerant
during
compression
that
is
A
to
B
and
this
is
a
under
the
area
A
to
B
on
again
PV
diagram,
and
this
is
equal
to
integral
of
VA
to
VB
PdV,
right.
W
BC
is
work
done
by
the
piston
on
the
refrigerant
during
discharge
from
B
to
C
that
is,
area
under
the
line
B
to
C
and
that
is
equal
to
Pc
into
VB,
right.
Then,
we
can
say
that,
W
ideal
is
equal
to
W
id
is
W
ideal
is
equal
to
Pe
minus
Pe
into
VA
plus
integral
of
VA
to
VB
P
into
dV
plus
Pc
into
VB,
that
is,
all
equal
to
area
under
A,
B,
C,
D,
on
the
PV
diagram.
This
PV
diagram,
in
the
previous
class,
we
have
shown.
∴
W
id
=
-P
e
.V
A
+
+
P
c
V
B
=
Area
A-B-C-D
on
P-V
diagram
=
Therefore,
this
can
be
written,
equal
to
Pe
to
Pv
integral
Vdp,
right,
with
the
domain
Pe
to
Pc.
Now,
the
work
input
to
the
ideal
compressor
per
cycle,
that
is
equal
to
the
area
of
the
cycle,
on
the
PV
diagram.
The
specific
work
input,
that
is,
W
id
in
kilo
joules
per
kg
to
the
ideal
compressor
is
given
by
W
id
equals
to
W
id
over
mR
that
is
equal
to
integral
of
Vdp
within
the
domain
Pe
to
Pc,
where,
of
course,
mR
is
the
mass
of
the
refrigerant
compressed
in
one
cycle,
and
V
is
the
specific
volume
of
the
refrigerant.
The
power
input
to
the
compressor
Wc
is
given
as
Wc
equals
to
m
dot
W
ideal
is
equal
to
V
dot
Sw
over
Ve
integral
of
Vdp
under
Pe
to
Pc,
right.
…
(7)
Then,
we
can
say
that
the
mean
efficiency
or
effective
pressure,
MEP
mean
effective
pressure,
MEP,
for
the
ideal
compressor ,
that
is
given
by
MEP
is
equal
to
W
id
over
W
sw,
sorry,
W
id
over
Vsw,
and
this
is
equal
to
1
by
Ve
into
integral
of
Vdp
over
Pe
to
Pc,
right.
The
concept
of
mean
effective
pressure
is
used
for
real
compressors,
as
the
power
input
to
the
compressor
is
a
product
of
the
MEP
and
the
swept
volume
rate.
So,
the
power
input
to
the
compressor
and
its
mean
effective
pressure,
this
can
be
obtained
from
this,
I
mean,
relation,
right,
and
this
equation
number
8
will
give
us
that.
So,
if
the
relation
between
V
and
P
during
the
compression
process,
AB
is
also
known,
we
can
say
then,
this
equation
which,
we
have
just
shown
is
valid
for
both
isentropic
and
non
isentropic
cross
compression
processes.
However,
the
compression
process
must
be
reversible,
as
the
path
of
the
process
should
be
known
for
the
integration
to
be
performed.
Therefore,
for
the
isentropic
process,
PV
to
the
power
k,
may
be
gamma,
or
a
constant
k,
is
equal
to
constant.
Hence,
the
specific
work
of
the
compression,
that
is,
W
id,
that
can
be
written
or
obtained
by
integrating
and
it
can
be
shown
to
be
equal
to
W
id
equals
to
integration
of
Vdp
over
Pe
to
Pc,
that
is
equal
to
Pe
into
Ve
into
k
by
k
minus
1
into
Pc
over
Pe
to
the
power
k
minus
1
by
k
minus
1,
right.
So,
this
we
can
say
that
k
is
the
index
of
isentropic
compression.
If
the
refrigerant
behaves
as
an
ideal
gas
then
k
is
equal
to
gamma.
In
general,
the
value
of
k,
for
refrigerants,
varies
from
point
to
point
and
if
its
value
is
not
known
then
an
approximate
value
of
it
can
be
obtained
from
the
values
of
pressure
and
specific
volume
at
the
suction
and
discharge
conditions,
which
is
k
equal
to
ln
of
Pc
over
Pe
over
ln
of
Ve
over
Vc,
right.
The
work
of
compression
for
the
ideal
compressor
can
also
be
obtained
by
applying
energy
balance
across
the
compressor ,
right.
And,
this
figure
says
that
the
energy
balance
across
a
steady
flow
compressor ,
what
it
is?
It
is
saying
that,
Wc
quantity
of
work,
that
is
done
by
the
compressor ,
and
Qc
quantity
of
heat
is
expelled,
right
and
inlet
is
m
Pe
Te
he
hc,
outlet
is
m
or
m
dot,
whatever
we
call,
Pc
Td
hd
and
Asd.
So,
all
discharge
h,
enthalpy
discharge,
As
entropy
discharge,
T,
that
is
temperature
discharge,
P
compressor
that
condenser,
that
is
discharge,
m
also
at
that.
So,
Se
Ar
also
evaporator
that
is
the
entropy
h,
enthalpy
evaporator ,
T,
temperature
evaporator ,
P,
again
the
pressure
at
the
evaporator ,
right.
So,
we
can
now
say
that
since,
the
process
is
assumed
to
be
reversible,
and
adiabatic,
and
if
we
assume,
changes
in
potential
and
kinetic
energy
to
be
negligible,
which
we
have
also
seen
in
earlier
cycles,
then,
from
energy
balance
across
the
compressor ,
we
can
write
W
id
is
equal
to
Wc
over
m
dot,
and
that
is
equal
to
hc
minus
he.
This
equation
can
also
be
obtained
from
the
thermodynamic
relation,
that
is,
Tds
is
equal
to
dh
minus
Vdp,
is
equal
to
dh,
and
that
is
equal
to
Vdp,
since
ds
is
0,
for
isentropic
process.
Therefore,
W
id
can
be
written
as
integral
of
Vdp
over
Pe
to
Pc
and
that
is
equal
to
integral
of
Pe
to
Pc
dh,
and
that
is
equal
to
hd
minus
he,
right,
that
is
h
discharge
minus
h
evaporator ,
right.
Now,
the
above
expression
is
valid
only
for
reversible
adiabatic
compression,
right.
So,
the
ideal
compressor
with
clearance,
we
had
earlier,
ideal
compressor
with
no
clearance.
Now,
we
introduce
that
clearance,
ideal
compressor ,
but,
with
the
clearance.
So,
in
actual
compressors,
a
small
clearance
is
left
between
the
cylinder
head
and
the
piston
to
accommodate
the
valves
and
to
take
care
of
thermal
expansion,
and
machining
tolerances.
As
a
thumb
rule,
the
clearance,
C,
in
millimeters,
that
can
be
written
as
C
equal
to
0.005
L
plus
0.5
millimeter.
This
is
a
thumb
rule,
where
L
is
the
stroke
length
in
millimeter.
I
hope,
stroke
length,
you
understood,
this
was
our
piston,
this
was
here,
and
right,
and
the
discharge
was
here.
So,
this
can
be
taken
as
the
L,
right.
So,
if
we
make
it,
then,
C
is
0.005
L
plus
0.5
millimeter,
where,
L
is
the
stroke
length
in
millimeter.
So,
this
space
along
with
all
other
spaces
between
the
closed
valves
and
the
piston
at
the
inner
dead
center,
that
is,
IDC,
inner
dead
center,
is
called
as
ance
volume
or
VC
right.
The
ratio
of
the
clearance
volume
to
the
swept
volume,
that
is
called
clearance
ratio
and
this
is
written
as
epsilon,
right.
This
is
written
as
epsilon,
and
epsilon
is
nothing
clear,
but
VC
that
is
V
clearance
over
V
SW,
that
is
the
swept
volume
right.
C
=
(0.005L
+
0.5)
mm
Then,
we
can
say
that
the
clearance
ratio,
epsilon,
depends
on
the
arrangement
of
the
valves
in
the
cylinder,
and
the
mean
piston
velocity.
Normally,
epsilon
is
less
than
5
percent
for
well
designed
compressors
with
moderate
piston
velocities,
that
is
3
meter
per
second.
However,
it
can
be
higher
for
higher
piston
speeds.
Due
to
the
presence
of
the
clearance
volume,
at
the
end
of
the
discharge
stroke,
some
amount
of
refrigerant
at
the
discharge
pressure,
PC
will
be
left
in
the
clearance
volume.
Now,
we
can
say,
as
a
result,
suction
does
not
begin
as
soon
as
the
piston
starts
moving
away
from
the
IDC.
When,
it
was
earlier,
when
there
was
no
clearance
volume,
we
saw,
we
told
that
the
moment
the
discharge
is
over,
then,
suction
starts,
right,
as
the
piston
is
moving.
But
here
it
is
not
so,
since,
there
is
a
clearance,
or
clearance
volume,
rather,
right.
So
the
piston
starts
moving
away
from
the
IDC,
it
is
not
so.
So,
since
the
pressure
inside
the
cylinder
is
higher
than
the
suction
pressure,
PC,
because,
PC
is
greater
than
PE.
So,
as
it
is
shown
in
the
next
figure
that
suction
starts
only
when
the
pressure
inside
the
cylinder
falls
to
the
suction
pressure,
in
an
ideal
compressor
with
clearance.
This
implies
that,
even
though,
the
compressor
swept
volume
V
sw
being
equal
to
V
a
minus
V
c,
the
actual
volume
of
the
refrigerant,
that
entered
the
cylinder
during
suction
stroke,
is
V
a
minus
V
d.
As
a
result,
the
volumetric
efficiency
of
the
compressor
with
clearance,
that
is,
yeeta
V
c,
that
is,
less
than
100
percent,
right.
That
is,
this
is
the
figure,
which,
we
are,
we
were
referring,
but,
let
us
see
the
equation,
which
we
arrived
at
yeeta
V
clearance
is
equal
to
actual
volume
of
the
refrigerant
compressed
over
swept
volume
of
the
compressor ,
right.
This
is
equal
to
V
a
minus
V
d
over
V
a
minus
V
c
right.
So,
this
is,
‘d’
this
is
‘a’
this
is
‘b’
this
is
‘c’
back
to
‘d’,
right.
This
is
a
P
theta
diagram,
and
in
PV
diagram,
this
is
a
to
b,
b
to
c,
c
to
d
back
to
a
right.
And
the
length,
as
we
said,
is
this,
where,
the
piston
is
moving,
right,
and
these
are
the
suction
and
discharge
pressures
valve,
rather,
ok.
So,
for
ideal
compressing
pressure
with
clearance
it
looks
like
this.
Therefore,
we
can
say
now,
that
the
clearance
volume
efficiency
or
clearance
volumetric
efficiency
can
be
written
as
yeeta
clearance
equal
to
V
a
minus
V
d
over
V
a
minus
V
c,
that
is,
V
a
minus
V
c
plus
V
c
minus
V
d
over
V
a
minus
V
c,
and
this
is
equal
to
1
plus
V
c
minus
V
d
over
V
a
by
V
a
minus
V
c,
rather.
Therefore,
the
clearance
ratio
epsilon
the
which
was
defined
as
V
c
over
V
sw
is
now,
coming
to
be
V
c
over
V
a
minus
V
c,
which
is,
roughly
equal
to,
V
a
minus
V
c,
that
is,
V
c
over
epsilon,
right.
Substituting
this
equation
in
the
expression
for
clearance
volume
efficiency,
that
is,
this,
we
get
clearance
volume
efficiency
is
1
plus
V,
which
was
here
1
plus
V
c
minus
V
d
over
V
a
minus
V
c,
that
is
equal
to
1
plus
epsilon
into
V
c
minus
V
d
over
V
c,
that
is
equal
to
1
plus
epsilon
minus
epsilon
into
V
d
over
V
c,
right.
Then,
we
can
say
that,
the
mass
of
refrigerant
in
the
cylinder
being
at
point
C
and
D
and
therefore,
point
C
and
D,
the
mass
are
same
and
we
can
express
the
ratio
of
cylinder
volume
at
points
D
and
C
in
terms
of
ratio
of
specific
volumes
of
refrigerant
at
point
D
and
C,
that
is,
V
d
over
V
c
is
equal
to
small
v
d
over
V
c,
right.
Hence
the
clearance
volume
efficiency,
that
can
be
written
as
yeeta
V
clearance
is
1
plus
epsilon
minus
epsilon
into
V
d
over
V
c,
equal
to
1
plus
epsilon
minus
epsilon
into
V
d
over
V
c,
right.
Therefore,
we
can
say
that,
if
we
assume
re-expansion
process
also,
to
be
followed
in
the
equation
as
p
V
to
the
power
k
is
equal
to
constant.
Then,
we
can
say
that
V
d
over
V
c
is
equal
to
p
c
over
p
d
to
the
power
1
by
k
and
that
is
p
c
over
p
e
to
the
power
1
by
k.
Since,
the
clearance
volumetric
efficiency
is
given
as
yeeta
volume
clearance
equal
to
1
plus
epsilon
minus
epsilon
into
p
c
over
p
e
to
the
power
1
by
k.
Therefore,
we
can
say
this
is
equal
to
1
minus
epsilon
into
r
p
to
the
power
1
by
k
minus
1
where,
r
p
is
the
pressure
ratio,
that
is,
p
c
over
p
e,
right.
Now,
we
can
write
that,
the
equation,
which
we
have
found
out
for
the
ideal
clearance
and
that
is
efficiency,
rather,
holds
good
for
any
reversible
compression
process
with
clearance,
right.
If
the
process
is
not
reversible,
adiabatic,
that
is,
non
isentropic,
but
a
reversible
polytrophic
process
with
an
index
of
compression
and
expansion
equal
to
n,
then
k
in
this
equation,
which,
we
have
just
derived
that,
in
that
place,
k
can
be
replaced
by
n.
That
is,
in
general,
for
any
reversible
compression
process,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
equal
to
1
plus
epsilon
minus
epsilon
into
p
c
over
p
e
to
the
power
1
by
n
and
that
is
1
minus
epsilon
r
p
to
the
power
1
by
n
minus
1,
right.
This
expression
shows
that,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance,
this
we
can
say
that,
it
is
going
down,
as
r
p
is
going
up,
right,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
going
down
as
r
p
is
going
up,
and
epsilon
is
going
up,
and
this
is,
this
is
evident
in
this,
sorry,
this
is
evident
in
this
figure,
where,
we
are
seeing
that
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
rather,
is
varying
with
r
p,
or
rather,
r
p
is
in
the
x
axis,
that
is,
independent,
and
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
dependent,
and
n
is
increasing
in
this
order,
right.
So,
this
is
n
1
less
than
n
2
less
than
n
3
like
that.
So,
effect
of
pressure
ratio,
this
is
r
p,
and
index
of
compression,
n
on
clearance
volume
efficiency,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
like
that.
So,
for
a
given
r
p,
and
n,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance,
we
can
find
out
from
there,
right,
and
for
the
same,
for
the
second
one,
as
n
is
increasing,
yeeta
volumetric
efficiency
is
also
increasing,
same
is
true
for
the
third
case,
for
the
same
r
p
…(16
…
(17)
right.
This
limiting
pressure
ratio
is
obtained
from
the
equation
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
equal
to
1
minus
epsilon
into
r
p
to
the
power
1
by
n
minus
1,
that
is
equal
to
0,
and
this
corresponds
to
r
p
maximum,
and
that
is
1
plus
epsilon
by
epsilon
to
the
power
n.
The
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant
compressed
with
clearance,
that
can
be
given
as,
m
dot
clearance
is
yeeta
V
cl,
the
V
dot
sw
over
V
e,
right
and
we
thus,
mass
flow
rate
and
hence,
the
refrigeration,
both
mass
flow
rate
and
the
refrigeration
capacity
of
the
system
decreases
as
the
volumetric
clear
efficiency
reduces
in
the
order,
in
other
words,
rather,
the
required
size
of
the
compressor
increases,
as
the
volumetric
efficiency
increases,
right.
Today,
our
time
is
up.
So,
in
the
next
class,
perhaps,
we
will
conclude
about
the
compressor ,
because
it
will
complete
the
9th
week
ok.
Thank
you
so
much.
