Basics of Refrigeration and Air Conditioning
Good
morning,
my
dear
students
and
friends.
Till
date
or
last
class
we
had
covered
the
there
are
many
cycles
I
do
not
say
only
the
cycles
which
we
have
covered
up
I
gave
you
the
reference
of
Professor
R.
C.
Arora
book
and
many
other
C.
P.
Arora
book
and
many
other books are there, thermodynamic books  are also there, many our professors, Prof.
P.
K.
Nag,
my
teacher ,
he
is
also
having
a
thermodynamics,
book
very
good.
So,
you
can,
whatever
book
you
have,
you
can
refer
that,
and
read
apart
from
the
normal
classes,
but
till
now,
the
cycles
which
are
required
for
us,
for
cooling,
for
production
of
cooling,
right we have covered up.
That
means,
now,
we
know ,
what
are
the
cycles,
how
they
will
be
implemented,
what
is
the
analysis
of
those
cycles,
those
we
have
done.
Then,
in
the
very
first
class,
we
said
that,
as
the
name
of
the
course
suggests
that,
cooling
technology ,
why
and
how
it
is
utilized
in
food,
right.
So,
if
that
be
true,
that
means,
till
now,
why
we
have
said
in
the
beginning,
how
the
cycles,
we
have
said.
Now
again,
for
that,
how
for
utilization,
we
have
to
go
to
the
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning,
right.
So,
we
have
to
tell
about
the
basics of refrigeration and air conditioning.
Again,
this
class
also
will
require,
may
be
some
of
the
classes,
because,
it
is
also
a
big
chapter .
Because,
this
is
the
application,
not
directly ,
that
cooling
production
application,
production
of
cooling,
that
application
is
the
basics
of
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning.
Of
course,
some
of
which,
we
know
already ,
like
this
one,
that
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
basics,
right.
How
does
it
work?
We
have
already
seen,
but,
yes,
though
it
is
a
repetition,
but,
still
required,
because,
recapitulation
is
also
helpful.
The
refrigeration
and
the
air
conditioning
is
used
to
cool
products,
or
a
building
environment,
depending
on
what?
Building
environment,
we
are
not,
I
am
not
keeping
it
away ,
because,
in
cold
storages, you have to also cool the  buildings also, storages or cool storages.
So,
that
is
why,
it
is
part,
both
cooling
the
product,
as
well
as
the
building.
And
therefrigeration
or
air
conditioning
system,
that
is
refrigerator ,
transfers
heat
from
a
cooler
at
low
temperature
or
low
energy
reservoir ,
to
a
warmer
high
energy
reservoir ,
right.
We
have
given
as
one
reference
that
we
have
taken
a
refrigerator ,
we
have
taken
a
refrigerator .
So,
heat
is
absorbed
by
the
refrigerator
from
the
low
temperature
reservoir
and
there
is
a
refrigerator ,
some
work
is
being
done
and
heat
is
rejected
by
the
refrigerator to the ambient. This is what, very simple cycle.
So,
we
can
now
go
to
that
how
it
is
being
produced,
whether ,
it
is
door
or
product,
does
not
matter ,
may
be
under
this
cycles.
First
one
is
indoor
air
loop,
right
that
is
supply
of
air
through
fans,
that
is
done
through
a
cooling
unit
or
cooling
coil.
So,
this
is
a
cycle,
then,
chilled
water
loop,
that
is
chilled
water ,
pump
is
continuously
going
through,
and
the
pump
is
supplying
the
chilled
water .
Refrigerant
loop,
refrigerant
is
going
to
the
unit
where,
it
is
to
be
cooled,
chilled
water
is
cooling
the
refrigerant,
if
it
is
required,
or
condenser .  Condenser water loop, it is a condenser pump, and water is being circulated.
And
finally ,
cooling
water
loop,
where
cooling
water
through
fan
is
being
used
by
the
air
back
to
air.
So,
it
is
a
cycle,
that
is,
thermal
energy
moves
from
left
to
the
right
through
5
loops
of
heat
transfer ,
as
we
have
shown
just
now
right.
Next,
we
come
to
that,
what
these
loops
are
doing?
Indoor
water
loop,
that
as
it
was
shown
in
the
previous
figure.
Indoor
air
loop
is
driven
by
the
supply
of
air
with
the
help
of
a
fan
through
a
cooling
coil,
where,
it
transfers
heat
to
chilled
water ,
and
the
cool
air
then
cools
the
building, or the space, wherever , it is. Then, chilled water loop.
What
it
does?
It
is
driving
the
chilled
water
pump,
water
returns
from
the
cooling
coil
to
the
chillers
evaporator
to
be
recooled.
Then,
the
refrigerant
loop,
it
is
using
a
phase
change
refrigerant,
the
chiller's
compressor
pumps
heat
from
a
chilled
water
to
the
condenser
water .
Then,
what
condenser
water
does?
Water
absorbs
heat
from
the
chillers
condenser
and
the
condenser
water
pump
sends
it
back
to
the
cooling
tower .
The
cooling
tower ,
does,
the
fan
of
the
cooling
towers
drives
air
across
an
open
flow
of
the
hot
condenser
water
and
by
that,
transfers
the
heat
to
the
condenser .
So,
this
is
how
the
refrigeration cycle in cooling is used.
Then,
next
comes
the
AC
system,
that
is
air
conditioning
system,
that
is
what
normally
used
for,
maybe
human
being,
or
maybe
some
product
like,
we
have,
so
many
instruments
equipments
everywhere
they
are
also
required
to
be
used.
So,
the
options
and
combinations
are
like
this
that
air
conditioning
for
either
personal
or
machine
comfort
is
used
and
in
that
split
air
conditioners
can
also
be
used
and
fan
coil
units
in
a
large
system
can
also
be
used,
fan
coils
mean,
the
entire
coil
system,
that
refrigeration
system,
is
in
there,
and
a
fan
is
blowing
the
air
through
that.
So,
that
is
also
possible.
Then,
air
handling
units.
In
a
large
system,
I
told
many
times,
or
if
I
have
not
told
in
thisclass
that,
I
hope,
you
have
seen
ice
cream
making,
and
in
that
ice
cream
making
the
semi
liquid,
which
you
get
from
walls,
and
other
places,
that
semi
liquid
ice
cream
also
comes
out from the ice cream freezer .
I
will
try
to
cover
up
in
one
class
as
one
application,
but,
there
this
semi
liquid
or
semi
solid,
they
cannot
be
transported
from
one
place
to
other
place
because,
by
that
time
it
will
melt.
So,
they
are
hardened
in
a
hardening
room,
there
the
cooling
unit
is
air,
air
in
3
turn,
like
one
refrigerant
is
cooling
one
heat
exchanger ,
that
heat
exchanger
is
cooling
air,
and
this
air
is
cooling
the
ice
cream.
So,
there,
it
is
air
handling
unit,
that
is
mostly
used.
Now ,
refrigeration
systems
for
industrial
processes
are
also
there,
like
small
capacity
modular
units
of
direct
expansion
type,
where,
it
is
50
tons
of
refrigeration,
or
50
TR
is
utilized.
Centralized
chilled
water
plants
with
chilled
water
as
a
secondary
coolant, where, it is 52 to 50 tons of refrigeration,  are used.
Brine
plants
with
brines
as
lower
temperature
secondary
coolants
are
also
used,
where,
the
tonnage
of
refrigeration
is
greater
than
250
tons
of
refrigeration.
Others,
are
small
capacity
modular
units
of
the
direct
expansion
type,
similar
to
domestic
refrigerators.
Centralized
chilled
water
plants
with
chilled
water
as
a
secondary
coolant,
or
for
a
temperature
range
over
typically
5
degree
centigrade,
they
can
also
be
used
for
ice
bank
formation.
Now ,
brine
plants,
I
have
told
earlier
that,
brine
means,
liquid
solution
with
salt.
It
can
be
any
combination
of
salts,
will
come
more
in
detail
when
the
application
parts are being taught.
So,
brine
plants,
which,
use
brines
as
a
lower
temperature
secondary
coolant,
for
typical
secondary
coolant,
means
primary
is
the
refrigerant
itself,
secondary
is
this
brine.
So,
secondary
coolant
for
typically
sub
0
temperature
applications,
which,
come
as
modular
unit
capacities
as
well
as
rather ,
large
modular
unit
as
well
as
large
capacity
units,
are
also
available.
The
plant
capacities
of
the
50
ton
of
refrigeration
are
usually
considered
as
small
capacity ,
whereas,
50
to
250
tons
are
considered
as
medium
capacity ,
and
over
250
tons
are
considered
to
be
large
capacities.
Now ,
refrigeration
at
large
companies
are
used,
bank
of
units
with
common
chilled
water
pumps,
then,
condenser
water
pumps
or
cooling
towers.
I
hope,
in
many
beautiful
buildings
of
offices,
you
might
have
seen
that,
in
front
of
the
office,
there
are
some
good
looking
cooling
towers,
which,
are
very
good
to look at, but it serves as the cooling tower for the refrigeration  cycle.
This
is
available
in
many
good
buildings
or
hotels
as
the
cooling
tower .
More
levels
of
refrigeration
or
air
conditionings
are
required
for
comfort
air
conditioning,
over
20
to
50
degree
centigrade,
chilled
water
system
over
8
to
10
degree
centigrade
is
used
and
brine
system
less
than
0
degree
centigrade
is
used.
So,
large
company
may
have
bank
of
units,
often,
with
common
chilled
water
pumps,
condenser
water
pumps,
cooling
towers
as
anoffsite
utility .
The
same
company
may
also
have
2
or
more,
2
or
3
other ,
3
levels
of
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning,
as
we
have
already
mentioned.
Now ,
the
refrigeration
systems
which
are
used
are
vapor
compression
refrigeration
systems,
which,
we
have
already studied and uses mechanical ener gy.
And
another
one
is
vapor
absorption
refrigeration
system,
that
is,
VAR,
uses
thermal
energy.
And
in
most
of
the
cases,
that
vapor
absorption
refrigeration
systems
are
not
so
utilized
as
vapor
compression
refrigeration
systems
are
commonly
used.
So,
2
principle
types
of
refrigerator
or
refrigeration
units
or
plants
found
in
industrial
use
are
vapor
compression
VCRS
and
absorption
refrigeration
system
or
VARS.
VCRS
uses
mechanical
system
as
the
driving
force
for
refrigeration,
while,
VARS
uses
the
thermal
energy
as
the
driving
force
for
refrigeration.
Now ,
in
the
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system, it is highly compressed fluids, tends  to get colder when allowed to expand.
If
pressures
are
high
enough
then
compressed
air,
hotter
than
source
of
cooling,
or
expanded
gas,
cooler
than
desired
cold
temperature,
may
be
utilized.
Now ,
compression
refrigeration
cycles
take
advantages
of
the
fact
that
highly
compressed
fluids
at
a
certain
temperature
tend
to
get
colder ,
when,
they
are
allowed
to
expand
which,
is
available
in
the
expansion
device,
or
turbine.
If
the
pressure
change
is
high
enough,
then,
the
compressed
gas
will
be
hotter
than
our
source
of
cooling,
that
is,
outside
air,
for
example,
and
the
expanded
gas
will
be
cooler
than
our
desired
cold
temperatures.
In
this
case,
of
course,
fluid
is
used
to
cool
a
low
temperature
environment,
and
reject
the
heat
to
a
high
temperature
environment.
So,
if
we
look
at
vapor
compression,
we
have
already
done,
say
recapitulation,
that
too
advantages
are
there,
that
lot
of
heat
can
be
removed,
that
is,
lot
of
thermal
energy
is
required
to
change
liquid
to
vapor ,
and
heat
transfer
rate
remains, high temperature of working fluid is much lower than what is being cooled to.
So,
in
the
vapor
compression
refrigeration
cycles,
there
are
two
advantages,
number
one,
a
large
amount
of
thermal
energy
is
required
to
change
a
liquid
to
a
vapor ,
and
therefore,
lot
of
heat
can
be
removed
from
the
air
conditioned
space.
The
isothermal
nature
of
the
vaporization,
allows
extraction
of
heat
without
raising
the
temperature
of
the
working
fluid
to
the
temperature
of
whatever
is
being
cooled.
This
means
that
the
heat
transfer
rate
remains
high,
because,
the
closer
the
working
fluid
temperature
approaches
that
of
the
surroundings,
the
lower
the
heat
of,
lower
the
heat
transfer
rate.
Then,
this
is
how,
we
have
already
seen
that
in
refrigeration
cycle,
there
is
a
condenser ,
there
is
an
expansion
device,
there
is
a
compressor ,
and
there
is
one
evaporator
right.
This
side
is
called
high
pressure
side,
this
side
is
called
low
pressure
side,
beyond
this
line,  above is high pressure, lower is low pressure line right.
So,
similar
to
this,
if
we
look
at
refrigeration
cycle,
right
which,
we
have
already
done.So,
I
hope,
we
can
skip
little,
going
through
quickly ,
if
we
see
that,
low
pressure
liquid
refrigeration,
in
evaporated,
evaporator ,
absorbs
heat
and
changes
to
gas
that
is
what
here
is,
and
then,
it
goes
to
the
compressor ,
next
cycle
it
will
come
from
the
compressor ,
it
will
go
to
the
condenser ,
third
side,
it
will
come
and
from
the
condenser ,
it
will
come
to
the
expansion
device,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
more,
we
get
that
refrigeration
cycle
here,
it
is
for
the
compressor ,
the
separated
vapour
enters
the
compressor ,
where,
pressure
is
very
high.
Then
the
refrigeration
condenser ,
the
high
pressure
superheated
gas
is
cooled
in
several
stages
in
the
condenser
and
then
once
it
is
condensed,
then
liquid
passes
through
an
expansion,
through
an
expansion
device,
which,
reduces
its
pressure,
and
controls
the
low
temperature
to
the
evaporator ,
and
it
flows
through
the
evaporator .
So,
there are dif ferent types of refrigerants used, which, we have not talked about.
The
refrigerant
determined
by
the
required
cool
temperature
and
normally
chlorofluorocarbons
or
chlorinated
carbons,
CFCs,
normally
known,
or
Freons,
normally ,
again,
known,
are
used.
They
have
the
refrigeration
number
as
R
11,
R
12,
R
21,
R
22
and
R
502.
A
variety
of
refrigerants
are
used
in
vapour
compression
system.
The
choice
of
the
liquid
is
determined
largely
by
the
cooling
temperature
required.
Commonly
used
refrigerants
are
the
family
of
chlorinated
carbon
or
fluorocarbons,
or
normally
known
as
CFCs,
and
are
also
known
as
Freons,
and
as
we
said
there
are,
R
11,
R 12, R 21, R 22, R 502 etc.
Then,
we
come
to
the
choice
of
compressor ,
design
of
condenser ,
evaporator .
These
can
be
determined
by
the
refrigerant,
by
required
cooling,
by
load,
which
we
have
already
done.
All
these,
ease
of
maintenance,
that
is
one
of
the
prime
factor ,
physical
space
requirements,
how
much
it
is
required,
where,
the
floor
area
is
very
highly
priced,
physical
space
requirements
and
availability
of
utilities,
such
as,
water
and
power .
So,
these
are
the
basic
things
which
are
required,
right.
Now
the
other
one
is
the
vapour
absorption refrigeration.
We
go
quickly
through
this,
because,
the
class
is
almost
over.
We
will
go
to
the
next,
other
thing,
for
air
conditioning
and
refrigeration.
Vapour
absorption
refrigeration,
normally
is
not
so
commonly
used.
You
might
have
not
come
across.
So,
here,
what
is
happening, you see, there are two vertical lines, this  one vertical line, right.
So,
one
absorber ,
one
this
is
the
cold
side,
and
this
is
the
hot
side,
there
is
a
condenser ,
there
is
an
evaporator ,
and
obviously ,
some
pumps
are
there,
and
hot
side,
absorber
and
generator .
These
two
are
in
the
hot
side.
I
do
not
want
to
go
more
detail
into
this
vapour
absorption
refrigeration
system
though
the
system
has,
as
of
now
high
promise,
but,
this
is
not
achievable,
because
in
the
absorbers,
in
the
generators,
in
the
evaporators,
and
also
condensers,
lot
of
research
work
is
still
required.
So,
that
is
why,
it
is
not
so
popular
as
ofnow.
So,
I
would
like
to
skip
them,
the
detail
process,
but,
as
we
said
that,
there
is
a
generator , there is an evaporator , there is one absorber ,  and also one condenser .
These
are
the
4
units,
generally
used,
and
it
is
complicated
also.
Unlike,
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
you
have
a
compressor ,
itself
is
complicated,
but,
others
are
condenser ,
a
heat
exchanger ,
expansion
device
is
again
one
unit,
not
so
complicated
and
evaporator ,
again
one
heat
exchanger ,
but
here
lot
of
things
are
there,
like,
the
concentrations
of
this
solutions.
So,
these
things
are
very
much
required,
right.
So,
with
this
we
complete
the
first
part
of
the
refrigeration
and
the
air
conditioning.
Thank you all.
