Pure Substance as Refrigerant (Contd.)
Good
afternoon.
We
are
continuing
that
reverse
Carnot
cycle
in
the
reality ,
that
is,
with
pure
substance
as
refrigerant
right.
And
in
the
previous
class,
we
have
come
to
the
point,
where,
it
was
up
to
the
step
point
3.
From
step
point
1
to
step
point
2,
it
was
isentropic,
then,
we
went
to
from
2
to
2a,
then,
from
a
to
3,
we
have
come.
Now
from
3
to
4,
we
will
come
back
right
and
3
to
4,
and
then
4
to
back
to
1.
So,
here
we
said
that,
we
are
doing with saturated vapour .
If
we
remember
that,
many
a
times,
we
had
said
that,
we
have
started
with
the
vapour
liquid,
that
is
on
the
saturation
curve.
From
there,
we
went
up
to
point
2.
So
from
point
2,
we
went
to
point
a,
from
point
a
we
went
to
point
3,
and
from
point
3,
now,
we
will
go
to
point
4,
and
then
back
to
point
1.
So,
till
now,
with
the
area
covered
for
the
point
1
to
2, point 2 to 2a, point a to 3,  we have seen or we have shown.
Now ,
let
us
go
to
the
remaining
1,
that,
remaining
2,
rather ,
are
like
this.
This
was
also
done.
Now ,
if
we,
step
1,
step
2,
step
3,
we
have
already
done,
and
that
was
shown
that,
area
under
3
b
c
a
3,
right,
and
3
b
c
a
3
was
this
point,
3
b
then,
c,
then,
a,
then
back
to
3.
This
was
our
TS
diagram.
This
area,
right,
that
is
the
area,
and
that
is
equal
to
h
a
minus
h
3.  This we have done.
Now ,
the
step
4,
if
we
look
at,
and
here
also,
we
assume
that,
both
the
kinetic
and
potential
energies
are
negligible,
or
equal
to
0,
right,
and
in
this
process,
it
is
an
isentropic
process,
and
therefore,
Q
is
equal
to
0,
and
if
w
t
is
assumed
to
be,
the
specific
turbine
work
output,
then,
from
the
first
law
we
can
say
that
W
t
is
equal
to
h
3
minus
h
4.
So,
when
we
were
doing
thermodynamics,
that
time
I
repeatedly
said,
please
keep
in
mind
that,
these
relations,
and
these
will
be
very
much
useful,
because,
every
now
and
then,
we
cannot
go
back
to
that.
So,
we
again
here
take
that
W
t
is
h
3
minus
h
4
from
the
first
law.
Then,
then,
we
go
from
this
to
step
5.
Now
step
5
is
the
process,
between
4
to
1 that is evaporation.
Here,
we
are
assuming
again
that,
no
kinetic
and
no
potential
energies
are
there,
and
if
they
are
not
there,
then
it
is
equal
to
0.
So,
if
no
work
is
involved
in
this
process,
therefore,
first
law
says
that
Q
e
is
equal
to
m
dot
into
h
1
minus
h
4,
right,
h
1
minus
h
4,
that,
if
you
remember ,
it
was
our
T
s,
it
was,
say
vapour ,
and
this
was
point
1,
this
was
3
to
4,
back
to
1.
So,
4
to
1,
we
are
going
back
right.
So,
that
is
m
dot
h
1
minus
h
4,
therefore, we can write Q e, that is, Q evaporator heat  is h 1 minus h 4.
Again,
that
capital
is
for
the
entire
mass,
m
dot
and
small
e
is
for
the
per
unit
mass
right.
So,
we
can
now
write,
that
this
process
is
also
isobaric,
and
also
isothermal.
Therefore,
from
the
relation
T
d
s
is
d
h
minus
V
d
p,
we
can
write
d
h
is
equal
to
T
d
s,
because,
there
is
no
pressure
change,
so,
d
p
is
0
right.
I
showed
you,
I
told
you
many
many
times
that,
this
in
the
T
s
diagram,
we
have
this
is,
right.
This,
we
go
there,
we
went
there,
we
came
back
here,
came
back.
So,
this
was
a
pressure,
this
was
another
pressure,
this
is
another
pressure,
this
is
the
intermediate
pressure,
p
I,
this
is
the
pressure
p
e,
this
is the pressure p c, right and this p e is  the same as 0.
4,
p
e.
So,
there
is
no
delta
p,
so
if
there
is
no
delta
p,
then
V
d
p,
d
p
is
0,
that
goes
out.
So,
we
can
write
that,
it
is
also
under
constant
temperature
isothermal,
right,
both
isobaric,
as
well
as
isothermal.
Therefore,
we
can
write
q
e
is
equal
to
h
1
minus
h
4,
that
is,
equal
to
in
terms
of
entropy ,
T
e
into
s
1
minus
s
4,
and
is
equal
to
the
area
under
4
1
d
b
back
to
4.
So,
4
1
d
b
back
to
4,
so,
this
was
our
point
4,
4
1
d
b
back
to
4,
4
1
here,
it
is
d,
here
it
is
b,
so,
back
to
4,
this
was
the
area,
which,
is
the
equivalent
to
the
refrigeration available, right.
So,
if
that,
we
look
at,
then,
if
we
go
back
a
little,
and
show
it,
in
the
real
diagram,
because,
ultimately ,
if
things
are
not
before,
eye,
so,
many
times,
it
becomes
very
difficult
to
visualize,
here,
we
see,
right.
So,
unfortunately ,
we
made
it
black,
it
should
have
been
white,
it
could
have
been,
then,
easy
to
visualize.
However ,
that
is
why,
I
am
repeatedly
saying,
so,
it
is
4
b,
or
4
1
d
b
back
to
4.
This
is
the
area
under
refrigeration,
or
we
call
it
to
be
that,
the
refrigeration
effect,
or
refrigeration
available
is
this,
right.
So,
by
looking
at
all
the
points,
we
can
now
come
back
to
this,
we
can
now
come
back
to
this
point,
where,
we
have
said
that,
yes,
it
is
under
area
4
1
d
b
back
to
4.
So,
the
same
result
could
have
been
obtained
if
we
would
have
taken
dQ
reversible
is
Tds,
that
also
is
the
other way of finding it out.
Now ,
once
we
have
analyzed
the
cycle,
then,
we
can
say
that,
net
work,
which
is
obtained,
is
the
total
work
input
to
the
compressor
minus
the
net
work
output
of
the
turbine.
So,
this
is
equal
to
the
net
work
of
the
cycle,
you
have
done
some
work
on
thesystem
for
the
compressor
and
you
got
some
output
from
the
turbine.
So,
the
difference
of
these
two
is
the
net
work
of
the
cycle
right.
So,
therefore,
we
can
say,
we
can
say,
mod
W
equal
to
mod
W
isentropic
plus
mod
of
W
isothermal,
minus
W
turbine
right.
So,
this
is
nothing
but
h
2
minus
h
1
plus
T
c
into
s
2
minus
s
a
minus
h
2
minus
h
a
minus
h
3
minus h 4.
| w
isen
| = h
2
– h
1
.
So,
this,
on
simplification,
can
be
written
that,
T
c
into
s
2
minus
s
a
plus
h
a
minus
h
3
minus
h
1
minus
h
4,
right,
and
the
process,
a
to
3,
and
4
to
1,
are
isobaric
and
isothermal
processes,
right,
which
you
have
seen
that,
these
are
isobaric,
as
well
as
isothermal,
right.
Just
previously ,
I
had
shown
you
also.
Then,
we
can
write
h
a
minus
h
3
is
equal
to
T
c
into
s
a
minus
s
3
and
h
1
minus
h
4
is
equal
to
T
c
into
s
1
minus
s
4
right.
Therefore,
W,
we
can
write
to
be,
T
c
into
s
2
minus
s
3
plus
T
c
into
s
a
minus
s
3
minus
T
e
into
s
1
minus s 4, this is not d this is s 4, right, there was a typing mistake.  So s 1 minus s 4.
So,
therefore,
we
can
write
this
is
T
c
into
s
2
minus
s
3
minus
T
e
into
s
1
minus
again
s
4,
right.
So,
we
can
write
that,
T
c
into
s
1
minus
s
4,
this
is
s
2,
is
equal
to
s
1
and
s
3
is
equal
to
s
4,
if
you
remember
that,
if
we
plot
again
that
T
s,
right,
this
was
3
and
4,
ok.
This
was,
this
was,
3
and
4,
that
T
s
right.
So,
this
was
3,
and
this
was
4,
right
and
this
is
isentropic.  So, s 3 is equal to s 4, and this was isentropic.
w
T
= h
3
– h
4 
So, s 1 is equal to s 2, right.  So, s 1 is equal to s 2, and we have then, come to the point,
that T c into s 1 minus s 4 is W, W is T c into s 1 minus s 4 minus T e into s 1 minus s 4.
So, we say that, this is area under 2 to 3 minus area under 4 to 1.  So, we can say that,
area under 2 to 3 is this one, and area under 4 to 1 is this one, right.  These things, we
have shown earlier also.
So, then, we can say that, we can say that, yeah, since s 1 is equal to s 2, and s 2 is equal
to s 4, therefore, we can write W is equal to T c minus T e into s 1 minus s 4, that is, the
total area under area 1 2 3 4 back to 1.  Then, if we plot that, T s, that we had this, we
started with point 1, went to point 2, went to a went to 3, came back to 4, and back to 1
right.  Perhaps, if I remember correctly , this was b, this was d, right and this was giving a
name a, right, and then, as we say , this is area under 1 2 3 4 1, that is 1 2 3 4 back to 1,
this area is the W net, right.  So, this area is the W net, therefore, we can write that, the
COP  is Q e by W, the COP  is  Q e by W, right and that is T e times s 1 minus s 4 over T c
times T e minus rather , T e times  s 1 minus s 4 over T c minus T e into s 1 minus s 4.
So, s 1 minus s 4, cancels out, remains T e by T c minus T e, which we said, many times
that, COP  under refrigeration is, T e over T c minus T e.
dQ
rev
= T 
Δ
s.
That
means,
the
lower
temperature
divided
by
the
difference
of
temperature,
lower
temperature,
divided
by
difference
of
temperature,
and
COP
is
only
defined
by
the
temperatures.
This,
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
that,
if
the
two
temperatures
are
known,
that
is,
the
evaporator
temperature
and
the
condenser
temperature,
if
these
two
are
known,
then,
evaporator
temperature,
right,
and
the
T
evaporator
and
T
condenser ,
if
we
know ,
then,
we
can
find
out
the
COP
very
easily ,
as
T
evaporator
over
T
condenser
minus
T
evaporator
right.
So,
for
a
system,
if
we
are
given
the
pressure,
the
temperatures
of
the
working
fluid
at
the
evaporator ,
and
at
the
condenser ,
then
the
COP
of
the
system,
we
can
find
out
very
easily ,
from
the
ratio
of
the
temperatures,
right.
So,
low
temperature
again
is
playing
an
important
role,
right.
Again
from
here,
you
see
as
earlier ,
we
have
said
many times that, COP  being T evaporator over T condenser minus T evaporator .
So, (h
a
– h
3
) = T
c
(s
a
– s
3
) and (h
1
– h
4
) = T
c
(s
1
– s
4
).
Now ,
for
a
given
condenser ,
if
the
T
evaporator
is
increased,
then
this
value
is
increased
and
the
difference
is
decreased,
right.
So,
if
the
difference
is
increased
that
means,
COP
is
decreased,
this
is
again
corroborating,
what
we
said
earlier .
We,
earlier
also,
we
said,
that
if
the
evaporator
temperature
is
increased,
that,
if
you
remember .
So
far
I
remember ,
we
had
said
that,
T
s
diagram,
in
that,
there
was
one
like,
this,
ok.
And
we
had
in
the
Carnot,
this
kind
of
thing,
that
is
1,
2,
3
and
4,
right
and
this
was
under
constant
temperature
T
c,
and
this
was
under
constant
temperature
T
e,
right.
We
had
shown
that,
this
is
the
evaporator
temperature,
this
is
the
condenser
temperature,
right,
and
we
said,
the work is here and down below , this was the refrigeration ef fect.
If
you
remember ,
we
had
given,
this
kind
of
two
areas,
right.
So,
there
we
said
that,
if
condenser
temperature,
for
a
given
condenser
temperature,
rather
T
c,
if
the
evaporator
temperature,
this
one
is
increased,
so,
it
was
increased
to
this,
so
the
area,
now,
is
rather ,
area
now
is
more
like
this.
So,
the
refrigeration
effect
available
that
is
Q
e
divided
by
W
net
is
the
COP,
and
this
Q
e
being
high,
COP
is
increased,
right.
So,
from
here
also,
we
are seeing the same thing, because, it cannot change.
See,
here
also,
we
have
to
have
the
same,
because,
otherwise,
the
entire
thing
will
be
jeopardized.
Entire
thing
will
be
non-conclusive,
right.
So,
here,
we
see
that,
if
we
increase
the
T
e,
that
is
evaporator
temperature,
then
COP
is
increased
for
a
given
condenser
temperature.
The
other
way,
if
we
decrease
the
evaporator
temperature,
then
what
will
happen,
this,
you
are
decreasing,
for
a
given
T
c,
right.
So,
this
delta
T,
is
increased,
this
value
also
decreased.
So,
COP
is
decreased,
right,
and
this
was
also
shown in that figure, which I had shown repeatedly , that, here we had 1, 2, 3, 4.
s
1
= s
2
and, s
2
= s
4
So,
this
was
the
net
work
and
this
is
T
c,
and
this
was
T
e.
Now ,
we
are
lowering
down
that
T
e.
So,
if
we
do
this,
whatever
was
our
area
under
earlier ,
this
was
also
under
that,
now
this
has
reduced
whereas,
this
has
increased.
So,
W
net
increased,
Q
e
got
decreased,
right.
So,
that
means
COP
is
decreased,
right.
So,
this
is
for
a
given
condenser
temperature.
So
if
we
look
at
the
other
one,
that,
for
a
given
evaporator
temperature,
what
is
the
effect
of
T
c.
For
a
given
evaporator
temperature,
what
is
the
effect
of
T
c,
either you can increase  or decrease.
So,
again
we
go
back
to
that,
so,
we
had
this,
right
and
we
had,
say,
this
is
the
work
right,
and
we
had,
this
is
the
refrigeration
effect
right.
So,
this
was
our
T
e
and
this
was
our
T
c
right.
Now
for
a
given
T
e,
if
we
increase
T
c,
that
is
this,
what
is
happening?
W
is
increasing,
right.
This
remains
same,
W
is
increasing,
this
remains
same,
so
Q
e
by
W,
W
is
increasing,
so,
COP
is
decreasing,
that
means,
if
we
increase
the
condenser
temperature,
from
here
also,
you
can
see
the
same
thing,
from
here,
you
can
see
that,
if
we
keep
the
T
e
same,
if
we
increase
T
c
then,
this
part,
denominator
is
increasing,
for
that given T e.  So the ratio is decreasing, so COP  is decreasing if we increase T c, right.
The
reverse,
if
we
decrease
T
c,
then
what
will
happen?
For
that,
given
T
e,
and
this
T
e
the
same
thing,
we
can
show
in
figure,
because,
our
time
is
not
there,
I
cannot
again
and
again
draw
that.
So,
for
a
given
T
e,
if
the
T
c
is
decreased,
that
means,
this
delta
T
e
is
decreased,
for
this,
so,
the
ratio
is
increased,
so
COP
is
also
increased.
So
again
it
is
converting,
whatever ,
we
have
said,
till
date,
right.
So,
with
this,
perhaps,
today's
class
is
over,
and
we
thank
you
all
for
careful
listening,
and,
I,
now
believe
that,
you
have
really
started
working
with
the
problem,
and
the
cycles,
right.
Understanding
the
cycles
is
very
very
important,
ok.
So,
thank
you
very
much,
we
will
meet
again
in
the
next
class.
Thank you.
