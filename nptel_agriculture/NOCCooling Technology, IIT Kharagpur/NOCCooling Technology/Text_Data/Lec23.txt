Psychr ometrics Contd
Good
morning,
my
dear
students.
Hopefully ,
you
have
practiced
a
little
about
the
psychrometrics,
how
the
psychrometrics
are
to
be
read,
not
only
that
we
have
also
said
about
the
different
lines,
right,
dry
bulb
line,
wet
bulb
line,
then
saturation,
then
relative
humidity ,
absolute
humidity ,
volume,
enthalpy .
So,
everything
we
have
said.
Now ,
we
said
that
we
will
do
certain
problems.
So,
we
come
back
this
is
psychrometrics
again
continuing, because it is a big one.  So, we need to continue.
Now ,
as
we
showed
earlier ,
if
you
remember ,
maybe
1
to
2
class
back,
we
have
shown
you
the
real
psychrometric
chart,
which
is
available
right.
And,
we
also
said,
this
is
a
function
of
pressure
and
that
is
why
on
the
left
side
it
is
written
that
at
sea
level.
The
moment
it
is
at
sea
level
written,
that
means,
it
is
under
standard
pressure
right.
So,
it
is
a
function of pressure.
We
also
said
earlier
that
psychrometric
chart
at
sea
level
and
psychrometric
chart
at
high
altitude
will
not
be
the
same,
it
will
be
different.
The
nature
of
the
curve
could
be
similar ,
but
the
values
are
quite
different,
right.
For
example,
I
told
you
also
that
there
are
different
temperature
scales,
here
what
is
coming
maybe
10,
16,
20,
24,
28
like
that
different
temperature
ranges
are
there
ok.
Similarly ,
no,
this
is
not
10,
I
was
mistaken,
this
is
minus
32,
plus
100,
minus
32,
plus
100
say,
this
is
the
temperature,
90
right.
So,
this is the temperature say 90.
So,
these
are
volume
lines
right,
these
are
volume
lines,
this
is
absolute
humidity
line,
again
sorry ,
relative
humidity ,
or
saturation
line,
that
is
100
percent
relative
humidity
right
and
these
are
relative
humidity
lines.
I
am
not
drawing
anymore
because
then
it
will
be
jumbled
up
and
we,
as
we
said,
you
see
these
lines
are
around
70
to
75
degree,
right.
Whereas
there
are
the
lines,
like
these
lines,
they
are
meeting
up
to
the
saturation
line,
whereas,
next
to
this
line
is
meeting
up
to
the
scale.
So,
this
is
the
wet
bulb
line
and
this
is
the
enthalpy
line,
right.
So,
and
we
said,
the
angle
between
x
axis
and
that
line
is
somewhere around 45 plus minus,  one is 40 another is 45 right.
So
we
get
the
saturation,
line
we
get
the
wet
bulb
line,
like
this
and
the
enthalpy
linelike
this
ok.
Then
we
got
these
lines
parallel
to
x
axis,
which
are
meeting
with
this
absolute
humidity
right.
So,
all
these
lines
are
known
and
we
have
draw
we
have
shown
also
right.
Now ,
let
us
go
back
to
do
some
problems,
and
those
problems,
you
will
be
able
to
draw ,
you
will
be
able
to
do,
unless
you
are
able
to
solve,
the
problems
obviously ,
we
can
say
that
you
have
not
learnt
psychometrics,
right.
So,
let
us
start
say
these
are
not the problem solutions, this is a problem.
Problem,
here
we
are
saying
that
air
has
a
dew
point
of
40
degree
centigrade
and
the
relative
humidity
of
50
percent.
Determine
a)
the
absolute
humidity ,
b)
the
dry
bulb
temperature
and
c)
the
wet
bulb
temperature,
right.
So,
this
is
our
first
one,
right.
So
we
can,
perhaps,
take
one,
let
me
try,
no,
it
is
not
going,
it
is
not
going.
However
so,
let
us
try here itself, because our background is, oh my goodness our background  is white.
So,
we
can
use
it.
See,
I
will,
I
cannot
draw
a
bigger
one,
because
bigger
one
will
take
lot
other
space.
So,
here,
so
here,
so
we
have
drawn
the
outline.
Next,
what
we
have
been
saying
that
dew
point
is
40
degree
centigrade,
right
and
we
said
dew
point
is,
meaning,
what
the
point
which
is
mixing
with
100
percent
saturation,
that
is
100
percent
relative
humidity ,
that
point
is
the
dew
point.
So,
first
from
this
scale,
that
is,
we
can
call
it to be temperature scale right.
So,
from
that
say
this
point,
corresponds
to
40
degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
we
identified
40.
Now ,
vertical
to
that
reaching
the
100
percent
line
is
the
point
where
this
is
dew
point,
40
degree.
Now ,
this
is
one
property
given.
Another
property
is
required
to
identify the state point.
So,
another
property
given
is
50
percent
RH
right.
Say,
let
us
assume
that
this
is
the
50
percent
RH
line,
right.
So,
if
this
is
the
50
percent
RH
line,
then,
from
this
point
we
said
that
to
go
to
the
dew
point,
in
the
line
parallel
to
x
axis
that
will
reach
the
saturation
line
and
the
intersection
from
there
will
go
down
to
come
to
the
temperature
scale.
Find
out
the dew point.  So, this is the reverse, we are doing.
So,
we
know
the
temperature,
we
have
come
to
saturation,
now
along
this
parallel
line
of
x
axis,
where
it
is
intersecting,
is
our
state
point
1.
So
this
is
the
state
point
1,
right.
Now .
what
we
have
been
asked
that
from
this
state
point
1
you
find
out
absolute
humidity .  So absolute humidity .
we
can
find
out
very
easily ,
how?
You
proceed
along
the
x
axis.
So
along
the
x
axis,
we
are
proceeding,
where
it
is
intersecting,
is
the
absolute
humidity
may
be
say,
0.002
or
whatever
value
it
has.
I
am
not
concerned
about
the
value.
I
am
concerned
about
the
method, whether you are able to identify  correctly or not.So,
we
have
done.
It
is
to
be
0.002,
perhaps,
right.
It
can
be
any
value,
because,
we
don't
have
any
scale,
any
value,
where
we
don't
know
what
is
the
exact
value,
but
like,
from
here,
one
thing,
one
minute,
from
here
the
scale
and
values
are
there.
So,
what
we
could
do
we
have
found
out
this
value
right,
we
have
found
out
this
value,
yes,
from
here,
we
have
gone
there,
this
is
the
40
degree,
say
then,
we
have
found
out
the
interaction
with
50
percent
RH,
say
this
is
the
50
percent
RH
line.
So
this
is
the
state
point
1,
and
then
we
can
find
out
from
here,
what
is
the
value
of
absolute
humidity ,
right
this
is
how
we
have
found out.
Now ,
what
else
we
have
been
asked
to
do?
Let
us
look
into
that.
We
will
come
back.
We
have
been
asked,
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
right.
So,
what
could
be
the
dry
bulb
temperature
from
here?
So,
vertical
line
from
there
reaching
this
is
the
dry
bulb
temperature.
So,
it
was
40
degree
so
obviously
dry
bulb
temperature
will
be
higher
than
that, say somewhere  it could be 50 degree, say right.
The
same
thing
we
can
do
in
that
scale,
in
that
particular
graph,
that
here
we
have
come
down
to
the
x
axis
and
corresponding
to
this
value
we
assume
it
to
be
50
degree
centigrade.
So,
two
things
we
have
done
and
you
can
also
do
it,
and
you
perhaps,
have
done
it
like
me
right.
And
then,
the
third
one,
which
was
asked
to
do
and
what
is
that?
The
third
one
which
you
are
asked
to
do
is
the
wet
bulb
temperature,
right
absolute
humidity ,
wet
bulb
temperature
right.
So
from
here
what
we
do,
this
is
the
point,
so
through
which
one
wet
bulb
line
is
going.
Suppose
it
is
not
going,
one
line
was
here
and
another line was here.
So,
we
have
interpolated,
which
is
passing
through
this
line
through
this
point.
So,
along
that
wet
bulb
line
we
went
up
to
the
saturation
line,
and
from
there,
as
we
said
earlier ,
we
are
coming
down
vertical,
and
this
vertical
may
be
somewhere
45
degree
centigrade
right.
Obviously ,
saturation
temperature
is
low,
dry
bulb
temperature
is
high,
and
wet
bulb
will
be
somewhere
less
than
dry
bulb
temperature.
So,
that
is
exactly
is
happening
here,
and
if
we
look
at
that
scale
in
the
proper ,
yeah,
if
we
look
at
this,
then
you
see
the
wet
bulb
line
which
is
going
is
like
this,
which
is
going,
is
like
this,
right,
and
this
meeting
the
saturation
line,
and
from
the
saturation
line,
a
vertical
line,
like
this,
as
we
have
assumed
it
to
be
45,
it
can
be
anything
because
we
are
not
doing
to
the
scale.
We are more concerned about the process, how you are doing.
So,
we
could
have
done,
one
problem
very
easily .
I
am
not
saying
that,
since
I
know
it
is
easy.
yes,
for
a
beginner ,
it
may
not
be
that
easy,
for
which,
I
am
repeating
after
scratching
it
off,
so
that
we
can
redo
right.
So
for
redoing,
let
us
first
find
out
the
problem.
So
we
have
been
given
two
property
values,
one
is
the
dew
point
temperatureand another  is the relative humidity .
So,
these
two
are
given
right
and
what
we
need
to
find
out,
one
is
the
absolute
humidity
and
one
is
the
dry
bulb
temperature
and
third
one
is
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
So,
these
three
we
need
to
find
out.
So,
if
we
redo,
redoing
it,
going
to
that
exact
scale,
may
not
be,
the
values
will
be
able
to
determine,
right.
So,
we
have
come
to
that
this
is
the
real
chart
right.
Now
I
cannot,
obviously ,
magnify
it
here
and
to
find
out
the
values
really ,
I
need one magnifying  glass because my power is high so I cannot see so close.
So,
what
we
need
here,
we
have
been
given
dew
point
temperature,
that
is
40
degree
perhaps,
40
degree,
and
I
do
not
know
whether
it
is
in
centigrade
or
Fahrenheit,
yeah,
perhaps
it
is
in
Fahrenheit,
ok.
So,
assume
that
40
degree
is
Fahrenheit
so
whatever
40
is
here,
so
this
is
the
40
this
is
the
40
line,
or
temperature,
right
this
point
is
the
40
point.
So,
from
there,
we
have
gone
vertical
to
the
saturation
line,
right,
and
we
are
given
another
property
value,
that
is
50
percent
RH.
20,
40,
50
this
one
is
the
50
percent
RH,
the
line
this
is
50
percent
RH
right.
So,
if
this
be,
the
50
percent
RH,
then,
we
come
from
here
to
this
line
wherever
it
is
intersecting
is
the
state
point
1,
this
is
state
point
1,
right.
So,
we
have
identified,
our
state
point
1,
and
now,
what
we
are
supposed
to
do,
we
are
supposed
to
find
out
the
absolute
humidity
it
is
said.
Now ,
absolute
humidity ,
to
find
out,
these
are
the
x
axis
parallel
lines.
So
along
this
line
we
will
go
to
the
x
axis
parallel,
and
y,
to
the
y
axis,
this
is
perhaps
somewhere
between
40
to
50,
somewhere
between
40
to 50.  So interpolation will give maybe say 47.
2
or
3
right.
So,
we
found
out
the
absolute
humidity ,
and
absolute
humidity ,
if
you
remember ,
the
unit
what
was
the
unit
we
used
absolute
humidity
it
was
kg
water
per
kg
dry
air
right
kg
water
per
kg
dry
air,
that
means,
47.3
kg
water
per
kg
dry
air
ok.
Moving
to
the
table
I,
may
be
wrong,
if
the
table
is
wrong,
right.
Then,
we
are
asked
to
find
out
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
right.
So,
state
point
1,
is
known
now
dry
bulb
temperature,
we
have
to
find
out
that,
to
find
out
the
dry
bulb
temperature
what
we
need
to
do?
We
go
vertical
from
the
state
point
1,
and
if
we
go
vertical
from
the
state
point
1,
it
is
coming
like
this,
right
and
what
is
the
value?
The
value
here,
it
is
showing
is
to
be
60
degree
centigrade, or sorry , Fahrenheit, it was in Fahrenheit  scale.
So,
60
degree
Fahrenheit,
right
and
the
third
one
which
we
were
asked
to
do,
if
you
remember
that
the
third
one
is
the
wet
bulb
temperature,
right.
So,
the
wet
bulb
temperature,
how
we
will
do?
So,
we
have
to
proceed
along
the
wet
bulb
line
and
we
also
said,
if
one
wet
bulb
line
is
this
and
another
wet
bulb
line
is
this,
so
if
yours
is
in
between,
then,
you
have
to
interpolate.
It
is
not
necessary
that,
your
point
will
go
throughthe
line
available,
you
may
have
to
interpolate.
So,
by
interpolating,
you
see
this
point
is
not
coming
on
the
line
already
drawn.
So,
we
are
parallel
to
this
line,
we
are
making
one
line
which
is
going
to
the
absolute
relative
humidity
or
not
absolute,
100
percent
relative
humidity , right or saturation line.
Then
from
that
saturation
line
if
we
go
vertically
down
then
the
point
where
it
is
intersecting
is
the
wet
bulb
line,
wet
bulb
temperature,
and
according
to
this,
the
wet
bulb
temperature
which
is
coming,
maybe
somewhere
around
52
or
53,
right
53
degree
centigrade,
I
correct
myself,
Fahrenheit,
sorry ,
53
degree
Fahrenheit.
So,
our
dew
point
temperature
was
40,
our
dry
bulb
temperature
came
to
be
60
and
our
wet
bulb
temperature
came
to
be
53.
So,
dry
bulb
is
highest,
dew
point
is
lowest,
wet
bulb
is
in
between
right.
In
the
other
day
when
I
showed
you,
the
scale,
not
only
scale
I
showed,
you
one
table
where,
we
said
that
the
difference
between
the
dry
and
wet
bulb,
if
it
is
small,
say,
1
degree,
then
the
corresponding,
if
it
is
1,
then
the
corresponding
humidity
or
relative
humidity
will
be
very
high,
and
somewhere
it
was
around
90s
if
I
remember
correctly
and
if
you
can
go
back
to
your
previous
class,
then
you
will
see
that
it
was
around
90s.
So,
if
it
is
1
degree
then
90s,
if
it
was
9
degree
then
it
was
somewhere
40s,
right.
So,
it
depends,
all
are
then
interconnected,
depends
on
the
situation,
depends
on
the
state
points
you
are
defining
and
then
finding
out
the
all
property
values.
Now ,
here
we
have
done
wet
bulb,
dry
bulb
and
dew
point
is
given
and
also
we
have
found
out
the
absolute
humidity
right.
Now ,
if
you
are
also
asked
that
you
find
out
from
there
the
enthalpy .
So,
the
enthalpy
line
will
be
somewhere
here,
so
it
is
around
20,
26
so
maybe
around
23
kind
of
thing,
the
value
will
be
somewhere
23
enthalpy ,
h
right,
and
if
you
are
asked
say,
find
out
the
volume,
see
here
one
volume
line
is
here,
another
volume
line
is
here.
So,
it
will
be
in
between
parallel
lines,
if
we
draw
this
will
be
the
volume
line,
so
that
volume
has
to be found out by interpolating right.
So,
volume,
enthalpy ,
relative
humidity ,
already
given
the
absolute
humidity
found
out
wet
bulb
temperature
found
out
dry
bulb
temperature
found
out.
So
all
property
values
are
known
at
the
state
point
1
right.
So,
this
is
how
you
can
find
out
all
the
property
values,
if
the
state
point
you
can
directly
determine,
and
you
can
properly
read
the
values,
right.
So,
I
hope
with
this,
you
can
easily
find
out
the
values
from
the,
or
you
can
identify
that
is
the
fundamental,
right.
So,
with
this
let
us
stop
today's
class
because
time
is up.
So,
in
the
next
class
perhaps,
we
will
try
to
complete
this
doing
some
more
problems
because
if
you
do
more
and
more
problems
you
become
really
expert
in
the
psychrometric.  Thank you.
