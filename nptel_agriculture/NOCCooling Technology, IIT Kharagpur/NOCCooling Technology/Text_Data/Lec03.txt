Good
morning.
So,
in
the
previous
class
we
also
said
about
temperature
quotient
and
its
importance.
Now ,
to,
as
well
of
course,
we
covered
a
little
on
preservation
techniques,
right,
why
we
need
preservation?
Now ,
to
go
forward,
we
need
to
know
some
definitions,
like
there
are
many
things
which
we
have
to
define.
For
example,
perishable
food
materials.
We
say
that
these
materials
are
perishable,
we
say
that
these
materials
are
not
perishable.
Now ,
the
word
perishable
means
that
the
moment
you
are
harvesting
or
slaughtering
or
catching
slaughtering
fish
meat,
catching
fish,
harvesting
fruits
and
vegetables
from
that
moment
if
the
material
is
destroyed
or
it
starts
deteriorating,
if
it
is
deteriorating then it can be said  that the material is perishable, right.
So,
those
which
deteriorates
quickly ,
after
harvest
for
example,
fruits
and
vegetables
or
soon
after
slaughter
or
catch
slaughter
of
meat
poultry
or
catch
of
fish.
So,
if
they
become
gradually
deteriorating
and
at
the
end
it
becomes
spoiled
then
they
are
called
perishable
food
materials.
Now ,
most
of
the
food
materials
are
perishable
in
nature,
most
of
the
food
materials,
but
there
are
some
other
materials
also
which
may
or
may
not
be
perishable
for
which
we
need
to
know
the
definition
of
certain
terminologies,
as
we
said,
food,
perishable
food
material.
Then,
we
also
say
that
there
are
some
materials
which
are
semi perishable.
Now ,
semi
perishable
food,
what
we
mean,
that
means,
it
will
perish,
but
not
so
early ,
right
it
will
perish,
but
not
so
early
it
will
take
some
time
to
perish.
That
means,
if
perishable
food
materials
after
catching
or
slaughtering
or
harvesting
if
they
stay
for
1
or
2
days
then
the
semi
perishable
food
materials
is
supposed
to
stay
for
2
days
some
weeks
or
months
depending
on
what
you
are
talking
about.
Then,
one
such
example
is
egg
which
is
semi
perishable.
Now ,
you
have
seen
your
parents
buying
eggs
or
you
are
buying
eggs
and
you
are
not
keeping
it
inside
the
freeze.
If
you
keep
it
outside
also,
if
it
is not very very hot days, then that egg does not perish  or it does not get spoiled easily .
This
is
called
nature
has
given
a
protection,
a
protective
mechanism
has
been
given.Now ,
egg
you
see,
the
nature,
the
most
create,
I
mean
as
far
as
creation
is
concerned
is
most
scientific
or
most,
what
should
I
say,
nature
is
so
powerful
that
egg,
as
we
gave
the
example,
from
the
egg
by
hatching,
we
get
the
animal,
whatever
it
be,
those
which
are
produced
through
eggs.
Yeah,
mammalian
do
not
produce
eggs.
So,
for
them
it
is
not
directly
you
get
the
newborn,
but
for
many
animals
like
chicken
or
duck
or
many
many
others
they
do
lay
egg
and
then
hatch
and
then
the
annual
comes
out.
Now
you
see
nature
is
so
beautiful
that
the
egg
during
hatching,
it
is
not
that
hatching
is
done
in
half
a
day or a day and the egg comes out, no, or animal comes out, no, it is  taking some days.
So,
till
that
time,
the
egg
has
to
be
intact,
otherwise
animal
will
not
be
produced.
So,
such
a
greatness
of
nature
that
it
has
given
a
coating.
So,
that
coating
is
given
on
the
nature
on
the
egg
and
this
coating
prevents
the
spoilage
of
egg
right.
This
is
an
unique
example
of
semi
perishable
food
because
the
protecting
is
done
by
the
nature,
itself
protection
of
the
egg
is
done
by
the
nature
itself.
So,
it
inhibits
the
spoilage
and
after
hatching the newborn comes out.
This
is
one
example
which
is,
as
I
said,
the
result
of
the
creation
of
nature.
Similarly ,
we
do,
we
human
being
also
do
certain
treatments,
for
preservation,
where
the
environmental
conditions
are
accordingly
changed
and
the
material
is
made
stable
a
little.
For
example,
if
we
do
pasteurize,
I
hope,
you
get
everyday ,
milk,
from
the
market,
through
pouch,
and
those
pouches
are
called
pasteurized
milk.
See,
there
are
many
others,
like
smoked
food
material,
or
pickled
these
are
simple
technique
by
which
they
are
used
in
extension
of
the
storage
life.
Now ,
in
pasteurization
since
it
I
told
that
whenever
new
things
will
come
I
will
try
to
give
some
idea
otherwise
it
becomes
Greek
to others.
Pasteurization
is
a
technique
of
course,
by
heat
treatment
that
at
63
degree
centigrade
for
30
minutes
or
72
degree
centigrade
for
15
seconds
milk
is
heated
that
heating
can
be
done
by
any
means,
milk,
is
heated
and
we
get
pasteurized
milk
where
the
pathogenic
organisms
are
killed
by
the
heat
treatment
of
pasteurization.
Not
the
entire
gamut
of
microor ganisms
because,
in
earlier
class,
I
said,
now
all
microor ganisms
are
not
enemy
there
are
many
microor ganisms,
which
are
helpful
there
are
many
microor ganisms
which
are
detrimental.
So,
obviously ,
you
want
to
keep
the
helpful
ones
not
the
detrimental
ones
and
in
this
case,
pathogens
are,
pathogen
means
those
organisms,
by
which
the
disease
is
caused,
any
disease
is
caused
is
known
as
pathogen.
So,
these
pathogens
are
killed
by
pasteurization
that
is
heat
treatment.
Similarly ,
smoking
also
one
such
and
pickling
also
one
such
method
by
which
human
being,
unlike
nature,
has
created
extension
of
the
life,
and
because
of
that
extension
of
life
or
shelf
life,
I
should
say
extension
of
shelf
life
and
now
the
shelf
life,
a
new
word
has
come
up
what
is
that
shelf
life normally is said to be.The
period,
from
the
point
of
either
harvesting
or
slaughtering
or
catching
to
the
point
of
consumption
this
duration
of
time
is
known
as
shelf
life,
perhaps,
it
will
come
also
in
the
definition
part,
but
since
it
has
come
here,
I
also
explain
that
right.
So,
the
not
required
or
unwanted
organisms
are
removed
and
the
shelf
life
of
the
product
is
extended
and
this
is
called
semi
perishable
food
material,
right.
Now ,
another
definition
is
shelf
stable
food
material.
Now
shelf
stable
means
it
does
not
require
anything,
shelf
sufficient,
means
I
do
not
need
any
help.
So,
shelf
stable
is
such,
it
does
not
need
any
help,
it
does
not require any treatment.
It
is
automatically
or
by
it
shelf,
in
the
way
of
shelf
health,
it
has
been
able
to
extend
the
storage
life.
So,
these
are
called
shelf
stable
food
materials,
these
are
nonperishable
at
room
temperature
for
example,
cereals
grains,
nuts
etc.
I
do
not
know
how
many
of
you
have
seen
that
your
parents
or
elders
they
have
bought
when
the
price
is
low,
rice
and
many
others,
particularly ,
rice,
I
am
talking
about
and
kept
for
maybe
half
of
the
year
or
whole
of
the
year
the
quantum
of
rice
required
when
the
price
of
the
rice
is
low,
but
they
did
not
do
anything
with
the
rice
just
kept
like
that
and
it
stayed
for
several
weeks
to
months
to
maybe
years
without
any
help
of
anything,
right.
This
you
might
have
noticed
or
you
might
have
heard
because
it
is
shelf
stable.
Now ,
in
this
regard
another
thing
which
comes
up,
which
is
not
written
here
is
called
water
activity ,
by
scientific
definition
it
is
called
partial
pressure
of
or
vapour
pressure
of
water
in
the
food
material,
over,
it
is
a
ratio,
rather ,
it
is
a
ratio
of
vapour
pressure
of
water
in
the
food
material
to
that
in
the
pure water at the same temperature.
This
is
the
primary
at
the
same
temperature.
If
the
temperatures
are
different
then
of
course,
it
will
also
be
different,
but
if
it
is
at
the
same
temperature
then
the
ratio
of
vapour
pressure
of
water
in
the
food
material
to
that
of
the
pure
water
is
known
as
water
activity .
Now ,
water
activity
varies
between
say
0
to
1,
right
and
it
has
been
seen
that
microbes
do
grow
in,
what
different
water
activity
level.
For
example,
if
the
water
activity is 0.9 and above then bacteria can grow , mold can  grow , yeast can grow .
So,
everything
can
grow
beyond
0.9
water
activity .
Similarly ,
if
the
water
activity
is
0.8,
as
we
said,
0.9
above
all
3
are
growing,
that
is
micro
microbes,
yeast,
mold,
generally
we
handle with these 3 types of or ganisms, microor ganisms  yeast, mold.
So,
in
this
case
water
activity
if
it
is
around
0.8
and
above,
but
less
than
say
0.9
then
bacteria
will
not
grow ,
but
yeast
and
mold
will
grow ,
right.
Now ,
if
it
is
further
brought
down to 0.
7
then
between
0.7
and
above
means
0.8
the
bacteria,
yeast
will
not
grow ,
only
mold
cangrow
because
for
bacteria
we
need
0.9
for
yeast
we
need
0.8
and
for
mold
if
it
is
between
0.9
and
above,
then
mold
will
grow ,
but
this
is
in
general
it
does
not
mean
that
it
will
not
be changing, right.
It
will
obviously
be
changing.
When
it
will
obviously
be
changing,
when
the
water
activity
levels
are
also
changed.
So,
that
is
why
we
can
roughly
say,
if
the
water
activity
level
is
maintained
at
0.6
or
below
then
chances
of
microbial
contamination
or
activity
is
very very low .
If
it
is
less
than
0.6,
microor ganisms,
I
rather ,
0.6,
or
less
than
0.6
water
activity .
So,
this
tells
that
the
rice,
which,
I
referred
to
which
your
parents
have
bought
from
the
market
and
kept
for
several
months
or
years,
that
has
an
water
activity
less
than
0.6
for
which
none
of
the
organisms
or
yeast
or
mold
are
able
to
grow
at
that
temperature
whatever  it be, this is called shelf stable food material.
Another
way
of
human
intervention
of
it
is
that
if
it
is
canned,
canned
means
you
have
seen
canned
and
those
canned
are
called
retorted.
Retorting
means
it
is
under
high
pressure
and
so
high
temperature.
Now ,
anywhere,
whenever
you
are
handling
with
temperature,
we
will
see
that
it
is
not
the
temperature
only,
it
is
a
time
temperature
combination.
It
is
a
time
temperature
combination
which
plays
the
role
of
it
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
whatever
it
be
depending
on
the
use,
this
may
be
time
temperature
relationship.
I
could
have
said
this
in
the
case
of
pasteurization,
when
I
said
63
degree
centigrade
and
30
minutes
72
degree
centigrade
and
15
minutes,
you
see
how
the
time
as
well
as
temperature
are
changing
and
also
that
could
be
around
say
145
degree
centigrade with no with no time or it is just  hold at that temperature.
So,
it
is
a
combination
of
time
temperature
which
is
acting
on
it.
This
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
a
time
and
temperature
both
together
is
acting
on
the
product
and
giving
the
result
out
of
that.
For
example,
if
a
canned
food
material
is
opened
then
you
have
seen
that
the
canned
material
has
to
be
consumed
within
that
moment
rather
or
you
cannot
hold
it
or
keep
it
for
long
period
or
some
period.
It
is
advised
that
the
moment
you
are
opening
or
destroying
the
seal
of
the
can
that
moment
you
have
to
consume,
you
should
consume
rather
for
better
safety .
Now ,
how
this
canning
is
done,
any
idea,
I
told
that any new thing, normally that will come,  I will try to figure them out easily .
So
that
it
becomes
easy
for
you
to
decide
further .
So,
canning
is
done
that
at
121
degree
centigrade
for
15
minute.
If
it
is
heated,
you
see
time
temperature
combination
121
degree
centigrade
for
15
minutes
then
it
is
expected
that
all
the
organisms
will
die
or
be
killed
and
you
have
organism
free
material
and
that
is
called
canned
materials.
In
earlier
days
this
can
was
not
so
popular ,
but
nowadays
you
see
that
everything
is
coming
interms
of
can
why
because
it
is
retorded
because
it
is
not
able
to
be
spoiled
so
easily
if
it
is
even
at
room
temperature.
So,
you
can
keep
the
canned
materials
in
room
temperature
for which it is a very good as  far as preservation or keeping it for long time is concerned.
Now ,
how
the
cans
are
prepared
you
have
any
idea
perhaps
not
the
can
sheets
are
like
this,
right,
thus,
if
this
be
a
sheet
of
can
then
if
this
also
be
another
sheet
of
can
then
this
sheet
is
made
one
side
a
little
fold
like
this
the
other
can,
other
sheet
also,
or
required
quantity
is
also
made
like
this,
folding
and
these
two
has
now
2
and
2,
4
surfaces
now
they
are
brought
together .
So,
now
we
have
4
layers,
one
this,
another
this,
third
one
is
this,
fourth
one
is
this.
So,
4
layers
are
there
and
they
are
tightened,
they
are
tightened
nicely
and
this
is
called
a
seamless
joint,
and
there
is
no
leak
no
real
gas,
nothing
goes
in
and
this
way
the
cans
are
formed
and
your
food
material
is
kept
in
the
can
and
then
heated
and
can
be
kept
at
room
temperature.
So
they
comprise
of
the
shelf
stable
foods.
Some
other
definitions
like
dry
storage
if
the
storage
at
20
degree
centigrade
and
50
percent RH is done, it is called dry storage.
So,
20
degree
centigrade
50
percent
relative
humidity .
We
will
come
in
detail
about
relative
humidity
when
we
will
go
to
some
other
class,
like
what
I
was
saying
that
this
20
degree
centigrade
and
50
percent
RH
that
is
RH
will
be
talking
in
detail
when
we
are
in
some
other
class
in
the
sense,
may
be
afterwards,
where
we
will
be
covering
psychrometry .
Now
cool
storage,
another
definition,
this
is
storage
below
12
degree
centigrade
then
refrigerated
storage,
there
are
two
types
of
refrigerated
storages,
one
is
above
0
and
another
is
sub
0.
Above
0
means
beyond
0
to
10,
9,
8
whatever
for
which
you have developed.  So, that is called storage above 0 degree.
Now ,
if
it
is
to
be
stored
below
0
then
it
is
normally
by
minus
18
degree
centigrade
and
minus
18
degree
centigrade,
why
it
is
perhaps,
our
time
is
not
there.
So,
we
will
let
you
know
afterwards.
So,
this
way
the
storage
is,
our
storage
time
is
increased.
Now ,
some
more
are
there
like
shelf
stable
or
the
shelf
life
which
we
have
already
said
that
is
the
time
duration
between
processing
and
consumption,
light
protected
some,
like,
medicines
also
some
materials
are
required
to
be
kept
in
light,
right.
And
it
is
protected
from
visible
for
rather
visible
light
or
wrapped
with
aluminum
foil
that
prevents
high
reactions, right.
So, with this let us stop today's class and wait for the next class.  Thank you.
