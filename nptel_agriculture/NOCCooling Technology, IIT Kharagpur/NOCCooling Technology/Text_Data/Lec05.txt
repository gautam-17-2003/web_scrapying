How to pr oduce Safe Foods? (Contd.)
Good
afternoon.
Perhaps
in
the
previous
class
we
were
talking
about
thermal
how
to
produce
safe
food
right
and
we
said
that
application
of
thermal
energy
is
one
of
them
and
we
came
to
the
point
where
we
said
blanching
is
one
of
the
techniques
to
reduce
the
both
microbial
as
well
as
enzymatic
load.
And
there
we
came
back
to
the
pathogen
how
they
are
killed
and
we
said
this
is
by
application
of
heat
which
is
known
as
the
pasteurization.
Now
how
we
understand
pasteurization
is
over
or
good?
It
is
done
by
a
test
which
organism
which
is
very
very
heat
resistant
is
selected
for
example,
micro
bacterium
tuberculosis
or
brucella
avatars
these
organisms
are
selected
and
the
test
is
done
for
the
for
the
I
mean
examination
of
whether
the
pasteurization
was
sufficient
or
not
that
is
all
test
all
pathogenic
organisms
have
been
killed
or
not.
And
the
name
of
the
test
is
called
phosphatase
test
with
methylene
blue,
right,
phosphatase
test
with
methylene
blue
that
is
done,
right.
Now ,
this
is
to
kill
the
pathogen
organisms
at
121
degree
centigrade
and
15
minute, but  there are other techniques by which these or ganisms can be killed.
For
example,
ultra
high
temperature
or
UHT ,
and
that
UHT
is
at150
degree
centigrade
for
1,
2,
3
second
and
we
also
said
earlier
that
appartization,
that
is
canning,
that
also
creates
sterilized
food
and
you
do
not
need
afterwards
to
keep
it
under
refrigerated
condition.
It
can
be
kept
at
room
temperature
and
that
is
how
the
can
materials
are
kept
at
room
temperatures,
right.
So,
this
way
the
safe
foods
can
be
preserved.
Now ,
coming
back
to
our
old
the
basic
thing,
which
we
are
started
with
that
how
cold
preservation
can
be done.
Now ,
cold
preservation
can
be
done
as
we
said
earlier
the
temperature
quotient,
that
is
Q
10,
what
we
said
earlier
is,
it
is
at
a
temperature,
it
is
a
ratio
of
rates
of
reactions
at
temperature
of
T
plus
10
degree
to
that
at
the
temperature
T.
So,
this
is,
this
was
our
definition
of
temperature
quotient.
Now ,
it
is
not
necessarily ,
it
has
to
be
every
time
10
degree
plus
or
minus
it
can
be
somewhere
7,
8
degrees
also
depending
on
the
cases.
Now ,
10
degree
centigrade
rise
means
you
see
whatever
reactions,
were
at
say
temperature
20,
and
if
you
make
the
temperature
30
then
the
rates
of
reaction
becomes
almost
double
which
we
have
shown
earlier .
Similarly ,
if
it
is
from
30
to
40
then
againrates of reaction becomes even more double  than that of 30.
But
if
you
do
the
reverse,
that
is,
if
we
go
back
to
temperature
which
was
30
degree
centigrade,
now
brought
back
to
20
degree
centigrade,
that
rates
of
reactions
at
20
becomes
half
of
that
at
30
degree
centigrade.
Same
is
true
if
we
make
from
10
degree
centigrade
to
0
degree
centigrade,
then
whatever
rates
of
reactions
were
there
that
will
become
half
of
10
degree,
right.
So,
this
way
if
we
lower
down
the
temperature,
the
rates
of
reactions
will
be
lower
and
lower
in
each
10
degree,
half.
So,
we
can
say
that
the
lower
the
temperature
lower
is
the
rates
of
reaction,
better
is
the
quality
of
the
food
product,
right.
Because,
we
have
seen,
increasing
the
temperature
is
increasing
the
temperature
quotient
value,
which
means
that
all
the
rates
of
reactions
are
increasing
whereas,
if
we
decrease
the
temperature
by
10
degree,
it
is
lowering
down
the
rates
of
reactions almost half of the  previous one.
So,
we
are
stopping
the
rates
of
reactions
to
the
extent
that
it
becomes
almost
halt
or
there
is
no
further ,
I
mean
reactions
at
that
temperature.
So,
in
this
case
we
would
like
to
know
that,
again
a
little
different
kind
of
thing,
that
civil
or
rather
chill
storage,
which
is
generally
between
0
to
5
degree
centigrade,
where
only
psychrotrophs,
we
already
said,
psychrotrophs
are
low
temperature
loving
organisms
and
that
can
grow
relatively
slowly .
For
example,
generation
time
for
pseudo
monas,
available
in
fish
is
6
to
8
hours
at
5
degree
centigrade
compared
to
26
hour
at
0
degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
from
here,
you
are
able
to
see
that
if
you
are
lowering
the
temperature
the
rates
of
reaction
for
example,
that
pseudo
monas,
available
in
fish,
it
takes
6
to
8
hours,
whereas,
the
same
if
it
is
at
0
degree
centigrade
it
takes
around
26
hours
which
means
that
the
lowering
of
temperature
is
increasing
the
storage
life.
In
other
word,
increasing
the
quality
of
the
food,
than
that
at the previous 10 degree centigrade  right.
In
this
case
it
is
everything
like
a
color
change,
right
a
color
change
that
also
is
restricted
or
minimized
by
lowering
the
temperature
by
10
degree,
right.
So,
at
the
temperature,
it
is
lowered,
the
plasma
membrane
of
organism
that
under goes
phase
transition
from
liquid
crystalline
to
the
gel
in
which
transportation
of
solutes
is
extremely
difficult
because
from
solute
from
solution
or
from
liquid
the
migration
of
solutes
is
much
more
easier
than
if
by
lowering
it,
if
by
lowering
the
temperature
you
can
create
a
gel
like
liquid,
then
in
that
gel,
the
migration
of
the
solutes
is
very
difficult
for
which
the
organisms
do
not
grow
or
do
not
multiply ,
right
that
is
why
0
degree
is
much
better
than
that
of
6
to
8
degree,
right.
Mesophiles
can
grow
at
chilling
temperature,
but
not
necessarily
be
killed,
Certain
Mesophiles
such
as
pseudomonas
do
grow
and
cause
food
poisoning,
this
is
typical.
Typical
means
we
can
say
it
is
exception
out
of
many
Mesophiles
only
pseudomonas
can
do
such.
So,
there
are
exceptions
of
course,
it
is
not
only pseudomonas, many more others also.Other
microbiologist
may
tell
much
better
what
are
the
other
organisms
which
even
grow
at
lower
temperature,
but
it
is
in
general,
likely
that
the
organisms
do
not
grow ,
do
not
have
the
activity
at
very
low
temperature
compared
to
that
at
high
temperature.
Large
pieces
of
meat
are
often
packed
in
plastic
bags
or
sprayed
with
various
moisture
resistant
things.
Eggs
are
coated
with
edible
oil
which
fills
the
minute
pores
in
egg
shells.
I
have
no
idea
whether
you
have
observed
it
or
not
at
home,
perhaps
you
have
a
small
weighing
machine
not
the
bigger
one
where
you
take
your
personal
weight
not
that
a
small
weighing
machine
around
2
kg,
otherwise
you
will
not
be
able
to
detect
the
changes.
You
keep
a,
you
keep
an
egg,
all
right,
buy
a
fresh
egg
and
weigh
it
and
keep
it
outside  maybe for 5-7 days.
If
the
temperature
is
not
very
high
again
and
again.
So,
now
it
is
coming
winter
so,
it
may
be
easier
that
you
keep
it
outside
and
every
day
you
take
the,
at
the
same
time,
maybe
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
every
day,
you
take
the
weight
of
the
egg.
You
will
see
that
the
egg
weight
is
gradually
decreasing
may
not
be
substantially ,
but
it
is
gradually
decreasing.
Then
the
question
comes
how
and
why
because
you,
in
the
egg,
the
outer
shell
is
very
hard,
right,
basically
some
calcium
salt
coating,
then
where
it
is
going?
The
moisture
is
going
away ,
moving
away
from
the
egg
inside
to
the
outside,
thereby
decreasing the weight.  That means, it says that there are some pores in the egg, right.
So,
it
is
very
micro
pore,
it
is
not
that
big
by
which
fresh
air
can
go
in
and
something
may
come
out,
no.
It
is
very
micro
pore
and
if
this
is
coated
with
edible
oils,
then
the
minute
pores
in
egg
shells,
that
gets
coated
and
this
loss
may
be
prevented.
Beaf
ageing
at
90
percent
relative
humidity
for
several
weeks
at
2
degree
centigrade
is
treated
with
UV
rays,
right.
So,
with
high
relative
humidity
beafs
can
be
stored
for
several
weeks
and
again
at
2
degree
centigrade,
if
it
is
treated
with
ultraviolet
ray
then
it
becomes
very
good,
or
it
can
be
kept
for
a
longer
period
of
time.
Now ,
this
will
come
in
detail
afterwards
when
we
are
coming
to
the
application
of
the
cooling
there
the
fundamental
application is the freezing, right.
Will
come
in
detail
in
freezing
because
that
is
one
very
very
important
process
or
we
can
say
that
fundamental
unit
operation.
So,
that
will
come
across
afterwards
in
detail,
but
here
as
a
preamble
we
say
that
the
most
of
the
popular
method
is
the
freezing
and
is
brought
conveniences
at
home
and
rather
it
brings
conveniences
at
home.
Food
material
begins
to
freeze
and
decreases
the
loss
or
spoilage
at
that
condition.
Simple
foods
are
stored
at
minus
18
or
below
degree
centigrade.
Why
it
is
minus
18,
I
hope,
I
had
said
in
detail
earlier ,
that
it
is
almost
equivalent
to
0
Fahrenheit
and
when
there
was
only
Fahrenheit
scale
available
no
centigrade,
it
was
observed
that
0
Fahrenheit
is
the
best,
0
or
lower
of
course,
Fahrenheit
is
the
best
for
keeping
the
food
materials
intact
that
is
howthis minus 18 number came up.
Now ,
in
case
of
microbial
growth,
if
the
freezing
temperature
is
prevailed,
then
it
is
not
possible.
At
this
temperature,
the
growth
of
the
organisms,
but
enzymatic
and
non
enzymatic
reactions
are
not
stopped,
but
the
rest
of
reactions
are
slowed
down.
So,
if
you
bring
down
the
temperature
to
the
freezing
point
level
then
it
may
not
be
possible
to
kill
the
microbes,
but
the
growth
of
the
microbes
can
be
prevented
and
the
temperature
at
which
this
freezing
takes
place
may
be
sufficient
to
lower
down
the
rates
of
reactions
by
the
enzyme,
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
thing,
because
enzymes
deactivation
is
again
you
need
to
heat
and
is
not
possible
here
to
discuss.
So,
the
rates
of
reactions
can
be
minimized,
that
is
the
enzymatic
reactions
also
and
the
growth
of
the
microbes
can
be
minimized
or
it
can
be
withheld
or
it
can
be
stopped
at
that
level.
so
that
no
further
growth of the or ganisms are possible.
This
is
again
with
respect
to
the
freezing
temperature.
A
study
has
been
made,
where
different
temperatures
were
used
for
the
same
product
and
the
shelf
life
was
found
out
and
I
hope,
you
know
that
there
are
many
ways
of
determining
the
shelf
life
of
the
food
materials.
And
in
that
case,
different
temperatures
like
minus
18,
minus
12,
minus,
it
could
have
been
6
because
18,
12
and
6,
but
unfortunately ,
it
was
7,
all
these
3
temperatures,
the
food
materials
like
cauliflower
or
chicken,
they
were
kept
and
it
was
seen
that
at
minus
18
degree
centigrade
the
storage
period
of
cauliflower
or
chicken
was
12
months
or
27
months,
right.
For
cauliflower
it
is
only
12
months
whereas,
for
chicken
it
was
27
months
means
more
than
2
year,
whereas,
at
minus
12
degree
centigrade
the
cauliflower
could
have
been
stored
for
2
and
half
months.
Now ,
if
you
are
doing
the
same
with
chicken,
that
at
minus
12
degree
centigrade
it
could
be
stored
for
the
15 months.
You
see
by
changing
the
temperature
of
6
degree,
both,
rather ,
that
the
chicken
could
be
stored
for
15
months
compared
to
minus
18
degree
centigrade
where
it
was
stored
for
27
months,
right.
But,
if
you
take
it
to
minus
7
degree
centigrade
then
cauliflower
could
have
been
stored
for
10
days
only
that
means,
1
week,
in
this
again
started
with
weeks.
So,
1
or
1
and
half
weeks
depending
on
what
is
the
situation,
what
is
the
condition,
right.
So,
at
minus
7
degree
centigrade
cauliflower
could
be
stored
for
10
days
only
whereas,
for
chicken
it
could
have
been
stored
for
8
months.
That
means,
if
you
take
from
chicken
the
different
storage
temperatures
of
minus
18
to
minus
7
the
time
span
of
storage,
though
it
is
in
months,
but
it
got
changed
from
few
months
to
several
months,
with
that
lowering of temperature even from minus 7 to minus 18.
That
means,
if
you
are
coming
lower
than
the
freezing
temperature
then
also
it
is
the
temperature
which
is
minus
18
or
below
is
dictating
and
saying
that
the
temperature
tostore
the
frozen
food
is
the
best
when
the
temperature
outside
or
within
the
material
is
minus18
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
other
than
that,
the
cauliflower
also,
you
see,
from
1
year
to
only
few
days
by
lowering
down
the
temperature.
This
change
can
happen
by
lowering
down
the
temperature,
it
can
be
10
days
at
minus
7
or
12
months
at
minus
12,
minus
18
degree
centigrade
it
can
be
stored,
right.
Hopefully ,
this
we
are
concluding
and
in
the
next
class
we
will
start
with
some
other
topics,
but
before
we
end
let
me
tell
you
that
this
is
the
course
which
is
used
or
which
may
be
required
both
for
commercial
as
well
as
for
academic,
including
the
experience
at
home.
So,
all
put
together ,
the
course
has
been
designed,
so
that
the
normal
questions
which
come
up
regularly
can
be
addressed to.  Thank you very much.
