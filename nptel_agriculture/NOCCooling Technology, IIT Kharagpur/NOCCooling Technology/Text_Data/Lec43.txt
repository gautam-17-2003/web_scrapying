Recipr ocating
Compr essor
So,
good
afternoon
my
dear
students
and
my
friends.
W e
are
continuing
with
compressor
and
in
the
previous
class
we
have
dealt
with
how
many
types
of
compressors
are
there,
their
division,
how
they
can
be
said
hermetically
sealed,
then
partially
hermetically
sealed
or
which
is
called
semi
hermetically
sealed,
then
we
also
have
touched
upon
reciprocating
and
screw
and
other
types
of
compressors.
So,
today
we
will
be
doing
Reciprocating
Compressor ,
because
in
most
of
the
cases,
we
come
across
with
reciprocating
type.
I
said
in
the
other
class
also,
it
is
not
that
other
compressors
will
not
be
dealing
with,
but,
as
we
said,
we
are
running
with
the
9th
week.
So,
our
time
is
also
limited,
because,
other
classes
are
also
there.
So,
it
may
not
be
possible
to
do
everything,
but
I
will
try
my
best
to
give
as
much
information
as
I
can,
ok.
So,
for
reciprocating
type
of
compressors,
this
is
the
workhorse
of
the
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
industry .
As
I
told
you
that
this
is
also
considered
to
be
the
heart
of
the
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
system,
particularly ,
compressor .
So,
out
of
which
reciprocating
takes
the
major
load,
or
major
share.
Now ,
it
is
most
widely
used
compressor
with
cooling
capacity
ranging
from
a
few
watts
to
several
hundreds
of
kilowatts,
right.
So,
modern,
and
I
had
said
also
earlier
that,
how
much
tonnage
of
refrigeration
is
related
with
the
kilowatt,
or
watt,
right.
So,
modern
day ,
reciprocating
compressors
are,
high
speed,
generally ,
around
3000
to
3600
rpm.
So,
you
can
imagine,
3000
to
3600
rpm,
it
is
very
high,
right,
and
I
will
show
you
the
diagram.
So,
no
point
of
spending
time,
single
acting,
single
or
multiple
cylinder ,
up
to
16
cylinders
are
available,
right.
So,
we
will
show
you
a
figure,
where
it
will
show
the
schematic
of
a
reciprocating
compressor .
And
reciprocating
compressors
consists
of
a
piston,
moving
back
and
forth
in
a
cylinder
with
suction
and
dischar ge
valves
attached
to
it
to
achieve
suction
and
compression
of
the
refrigerant
vapour ,
right.
So,
its
construction
and
working
are
somewhat
similar
to
two-stroke
engine
as
suction
and
compressor
of
the
refrigeration
vapour
are
completed
inone
revolution
of
the
crank.
The
suction
side
of
the
compressor
is
connected
to
the
exit
of
the
evaporator ,
while
the
dischar ge
side
of
the
compressor
is
connected
to
the
condenser
inlet.
This
also
we
had
said
earlier ,
the
suction
inlet
and
the
dischar ge
outlet
valves
open
and
close
due
to
the
pressure
dif ferences
between
the
cylinder
and
the
inlet
or
outlet
manifolds,
respectively .
The
pressure
in
the
inlet
manifold
is
equal
to
or
slightly
less
than
the
evaporator
pressure.
Similarly ,
the
pressure
in
the
outlet
manifold
is
equal
to
or
slightly
greater
than
the
condenser
pressure.
Otherwise,
from
the
inlet,
if
this
is
the
valve,
if
this
is
the
inlet,
and
if
this
is
the
valve,
so,
the
valve
seat
has
to
open,
because
of
the
pressure
of
the
inlet,
then
only
it
will
go
to
the
compressor ,
right.
Similarly ,
the
outlet
one,
there
is
a
valve
seat,
the
pressure
of
the
cylinder
has
to
be
higher
than
the
pressure
of
the
condenser ,
otherwise,
the
seat
will
not
open.
The
moment
this
pressure
equalizes
this
come
back,
right.
So,
this
is
the
mechanism,
how
the
inlet
and
outlet
operates.
The
purpose
of
the
manifolds,
is
to
provide
stable
inlet
and
outlet
pressures,
for
the
smooth
operation
of
the
valves
and
also
provide
a
space
for
mounting
the
valves.
This
is
the
typical
schematic
of
or
a
reciprocating
compressor ,
right.
As
you
see,
as
you
see
from
here,
that,
you
have
a
suction
valve,
right,
this
is
the
cylinder ,
this
is
the
cylinder ,
you
have
suction
valve,
you
have
a
dischar ge
valve,
right,
and
clearance
volume
of
the
piston.
So,
with
this
crank
and
connecting
rod
mechanism
this
is
called
crank
and
connecting
rod
mechanism,
right,
by
which,
by
which,
the
this
rotates
along
with.
So,
when
it
comes
to
this
point,
this
goes
there,
when
it
goes
to
that
point,
this
comes
to
this
place,
right.
So,
this
way ,
it
is,
as
the
crank
and
connecting
rod
mechanism,
what,
it
is
also
like
that.
So,
you
have
the
piston.
This
is
the
piston.
I
gave
you
example
of
that
during
your
holi,
you
use
similar
kind
of
thing,
right.
So,
like
that,
and
this
is
that,
where
your
suction
and
dischar ge,
they
are
also
controlled,
right.
So,
there
is
a
balancing
weight,
shaft
crank
pin
connecting,
piston
rod
etc.
piston
pin
etc.,
this
is
the
cylinder .
So,
with
this
schematic
diagram
of
the
reciprocating
type
of
compressor ,
now
let
us
go
into
it.
The
valves
used
are
reed
or
plate
type,
which
are
either
floating
or
clamped,
usually
backstops
are
provided
to
limit
the
valve
displacement
and
springs
may
be
provided
for
smooth
return
after
opening
or
closing.
The
piston
speed
is
decided
by ,
valve
type
to
high
speed,
will
give
excessive
vapour
velocities,
that
will
decrease
the
volumetric
ef ficiency
and
the
throttling
loss
will
decrease
the
compression
ef ficiency .
Performance
of
a
reciprocating
compressor ,
that
involves
for
a
given
evaporator ,
and
condenser
pressure,
the
important
performance
parameters
of
a
reciprocating
compressor
or
refrigerant,
compressor
are
number
1.
The
mass
flow
rate
number
1,
the
mass
flow
rate
that
is
m
or
it
can
be
said
m
dot,
it
is
rather ,
I
told
also
earlier ,
if
it
is
flow
rate,
thenit
is
generally ,
the
nomenclature
used
is
m
dot
of
compressor
for
a
given
displacement
rate.
Power
consumption
of
the
compressor ,
that
is,
W
c,
temperature
of
the
refrigerant
at
the
compressor
exit,
that
is,
T
dischar ge,
and
performance
under
part
load
conditions.
These
are
the
parameters,
which
dictate
the
performance
of
the
reciprocating
type
of
compressor .
Now ,
the
mass
flow
rate
decides
the
refrigeration
capacity
of
the
system
and
for
a
given
compressor ,
inlet
condition,
it
depends
on
the
volumetric
ef ficiency
of
the
compressor .
The
volumetric
ef ficiency ,
that
is
yeeta
V ,
is
defined
as
the
ratio
of
the
volumetric
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant
to
the
maximum
possible
volumetric
flow
rate,
which
is
equal
to
the
compressor
displacement
rate,
that
is,
yeeta
volumetric,
we
can
write
to
be
equal
to
volumetric
flow
rate
over
compressor
displacement
rate,
or
we
can
say
it
to
be,
m
dot
into
V
e
over
V
dot
S
W ,
right,
where
m
dot
are
the
mass
flow
rate,
here
we
have
written,
m
dot,
but
here,
we
could
not,
m
dot
are
the
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant
in
kg
per
second,
and
V
S
W
that
is
the
compressor
displacement
rate
in
meter
cube
per
second,
this
is
there,
and
V
e,
is
the
specific
volume,
that
is,
meter
cube
per
kg
of
the
refrigerant
at
the
compressor
inlet,
right.
As
you
know
that,
specific
volume
is
also
a
function
of
the
pressure,
or
temperature.
Now ,
if
we
go
back
a
little,
if
we
go
back
a
little
here,
you
see,
here
you
see
that,
I
was
saying
about
specific
volume,
yes,
that
was
the
thing,
that
when
the
gas
is
or
this
piston
position
is
here
right.
It
has
a
evaporator
pressure
and
that
is
P
evaporator ,
right,
and
there,
when
it
is
going
to
the
condenser ,
it
is
equivalent
to
the
P
condenser .
Definitely ,
P
condenser
is
much
much
higher
than
P
evaporator ,
right.
So,
likewise,
when
this
pressure
is
getting
up
due
to
the
compression,
right,
or
it
is
the
reverse,
this
way ,
as
it
is
drawn.
So,
when
it
is
compressed,
the
temperature
also
is
going
up.
So,
that
is
also
saying
that,
the
specific
volume
will
be
higher ,
right
or
rather ,
higher ,
or
lower
depending
on
the
compressor ,
depending
on
the
temperature,
this
will
be,
ok.
For
a
given
evaporator ,
and
condenser
temperatures,
one
can
also
use
the
volumetric
refrigeration
capacity ,
that
is,
kilowatt
per
meter
cube
to
indicate
the
volumetric
ef ficiency
of
the
compressor .
The
actual
volumetric
ef ficiency ,
or
volumetric
capacity
of
the
compressor ,
depends
on
the
operating
conditions,
and
the
design
of
the
compressor ,
right.
So,
we
can
say ,
in
earlier
equation,
we
have
shown
it
to
be
equation
number
1.
So,
the
power
consumption,
kilowatt
in
Kw ,
rather ,
or ,
alternatively ,
the
power
input
per
unit
refrigeration
capacity ,
that
is
kilowatt
per
kilowatt,
that
depends
on
the
compressor
ef ficiency ,
that
is,
yeeta
compressor ,
ef ficiency
of
the
mechanical
drive,
that
is,
yeeta
mechanical,
and
the
motor
ef ficiency ,
that
is,
yeeta
motor .
All
these
three
will
dictate
the
resultant
one.
For
a
refrigerant
compressor ,
the
power
input,
W
c,
that
can
be
obtained
from
the
relation
that,
W
c
equal
to
W
ideal
over
yeeta
c
into
yeeta
mechanical
into
yeeta
motor
right.
So,
where
obviously ,
W
ideal
is
the
power
input
in
ideal
compressor ,
the
temperature
at
the
exit
of
the
compressor ,
that
is
dischar ge
compressor ,
is
that,
that
depends
on
the
type
of
refrigerant
used
and
the
type
of
compressor
cooling,
you
are
using,
how
you
are
using
the
compressor .
I
go
back
once
more
to
show
that
compressor
inlet
or
the
diagram.
---------
(2)
This
diagram
says
that,
this
compressor ,
this
compressor
cylinder ,
when
you
are
compressing
it,
this
way ,
and
you
are
relieving
it,
right.
So,
that
time,
because
of
the
pressure
dif ference,
there
will
be
temperature
increase
to
keep
the
compressor
at
given
operating
temperature,
some
cooling
facility
are
also
provided
with
this.
So,
that
the
compressor
is
under
cooling
condition.
Unnecessarily ,
there
should
not
be
rise
in
temperature,
right.
So,
that
is
what
we
are
saying
here
ok.
Then
ideal
receding
compressor ,
what
it
can
be,
because,
if
earlier
also
in
cycles,
we
have
shown,
the
earlier ,
sorry ,
the
ideal
cycle
is
the
Carnot
cycle.
So,
if
we
know ,
what
could
be
an
ideal
compressor ,
then,
how
your
compressor
actual
is
behaving,
that
can
be
compared.
So,
an
ideal
compressor ,
reciprocating
compressor ,
is
one,
in
which,
the
clearance
volume
is
0.
Mind
it
again,
we
will
go
back
because,
this
clearance
volume,
if
it
is
not
going
back
and
forth,
you
remember ,
here
we
had
two
valves,
one
is
suction
and
another
is
dischar ge,
and
there
was
that
piston,
which
is
reciprocating,
this
way
or
this
way .
Now ,
what
we
are
saying
that,
there
is
no
clearance
volume
for
the
ideal
reciprocating
type.
So,
this,
if
this
would
have
been
a
clearance
volume,
that
would
have
always
remained
there.
So,
that
would
have
been,
rather ,
eliminated,
or
could
have
been
reduced
from
the
volume
of
the
refrigerant
gas
being
under
compression,
right,
but
this
is
theoretical
or
ideal
right.
So,
we
say
that,
the
parameter ,
this
we
have
already
done,
sorry ,
then,
yeah,
that
clearance
volume
is
0,
that
is,
at
the
end
of
the
dischar ge
process,
the
volume
of
refrigerant
inside
the
cylinder
is
0.
No
pressure
drops
during
suction
and
compression.
Again,
another
very
very
ideal.
In
reality ,
it
may
not
be
suction
compression
and
dischar ge
are
reversible
and
adiabatic,
right.
So,
Q
is
0,
and
that
we
can
confirm
from
the
figure,
which
shows
the
schematic
of
an
ideal
compression
process
on
pressure
volume
and
pressure
crank
angle
theta
diagram,
right.
As
it
is
shown
in
this
figure,
the
cycle
of
the
operation,
that
consists
of
process,
ok.
Let
us
first
see
that
this
is
the
ideal
reciprocating
compressor
on
a
PV
and
P
theta
diagram.
Obviously ,
P
theta,
as
you
are
saying
that,
this
is
the
theta,
right.
So,
because,
depending
on
how
it
is
rotating,
what
is
the
angle
with,
what
is
the
position
of
the
piston
here,
or
here,
that
will
depend
on
that
theta.
So,
that
is
why ,
there
is
a
graph
for ,
there
is
a
graph
for
P
e
P
c,
that
is
evaporator
pressure,
that
is
compressor
pressure,
right.
So,
this
is
P
versus
theta
right
and
let
us
see
into
this,
ok.
So,
that
c
and
d,
if
you
remember ,
there,
what
was
the
suction
and
another
was
the
dischar ge,
right.
So,
P
c
is
this
way ,
that
how
it
is
progressing,
this
is
the
evaporator
pressure.
So,
it
is
under
compression,
comes
to
a
point
‘a’,
this
is
the
‘d’,
comes
to
a
point
‘a’
and
‘d’
is
the,
and
it,
then,
goes
to
the
point
‘b’
right,
where
it
attains
the
condenser
pressure,
P
c,
and
then
it
comes
to
the
point
‘c’
and
then,
comes
back
to
again
point
‘d’.
So,
this
is
the
cycle,
right.
So,
what
we
need,
we
need
to
know
that,
in
an
ideal
compressor ,
how
it
is
varying
with
PV
and
P
theta
diagram,
that
we
have
shown,
ok.
So,
if
we
go
back,
if
we
go
back
that
process,
‘DA ’,
this
is
an
isobaric
suction
process,
during
which,
the
piston
moves
from
the
inner
dead
centre,
IDC
to
the
outer
dead
centre
ODC,
right.
And
the
suction
valve
remains
open,
during
this
process,
and
refrigerant,
at
a
constant
pressure,
P
e,
flows
into
the
cylinder .
Then,
the
process
‘AB’,
that,
this
is
an
isentropic
compression
process.
During
this
process,
the
piston
moves
from
ODC
towards
IDC,
right.
Both,
the
suction
and
dischar ge
valves
remain
closed,
during
this
process,
and
the
pressure
of
the
refrigerant
increases
from
a
pressure
P
e
to
a
pressure
P
c,
right.
So,
this
is
what
we
have
already
discussed.
Then
process
B
to
C,
this
is
an
isobaric
dischar ge
process.
During
this
process,
the
suction
valve
remains
closed
and
the
dischar ge
valve
opens.
Refrigerant
at
a
constant
pressure
P
c
is
expelled
from
the
compressor ,
as
the
piston
moves
to
IDC.
Since,
the
clearance
volume
is
0,
for
an
ideal
compressor ,
no
gas
is
left
in
the
compressor ,
at
the
end
of
this,
ok.
So,
it
comes
back
to
ODC,
and
the
volumetric
flow
rate
of
refrigerant
at
suction
condition
is
equal
to
the
compressor
displacement
rate.
Hence,
the
volumetric
ef ficiency
of
the
ideal
compressor
is
100
percent.
The
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant
of
an
ideal
compressor ,
that
can
be
given
by
this
m
dot
is
equal
to
V
s
w
over
V
e.
For
a
given
refrigeration
capacity ,
the
required
size
of
the
compressor
will
be
minimum,
if
the
compressor
behaves
as
an
ideal
compressor .
And
the
swept
volume
S
w ,
the
swept
volume
of
the
compressor
is
given
by
V
s
w
equal
to
N
into,
capital
N
into
pi
d
square
by
4
into
L
right.
Of
course,
N
is
the
number
of
cylinders,
cap,
small
n,
capital
N
is
the
rotation
speed
of
the
compressor
revolutions
per
second,
D
is
the
bore
of
the
cylinder
diameter
and
L
is
the
stroke
length,
meter .
Our
time
today
is
up.
W e
will
continue
with
this
reciprocating
compressor
in
the
next
class
also.
Thank
you
very
much.
