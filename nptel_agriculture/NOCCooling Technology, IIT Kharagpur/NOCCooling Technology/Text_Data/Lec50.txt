Evaporator
and
Expansion
Device
Good
morning,
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
my
dear
friends.
W e
are
in
the
last
phase
of
completion
of
the
individual
components.
W e
have
already
done
compressors,
we
have
done
condensers,
and
some
extra.
W e
have
also
incorporated,
because,
as
I
told
you
earlier
also,
the
moment
a
new
thing
comes,
which,
may
or
may
not
be,
a
part
of
it,
but,
I
would
like
to
highlight
on
that,
because,
it
helps,
because,
otherwise,
you
have
to
go
back
to
somewhere,
and
then
find
out
what
is
that.
So,
that
is
how ,
I
have
given
you.
In
some
cases,
I
had
to
really
go
forward
a
little
fast,
because,
time,
because
of
the
time
constraint,
right.
So,
now ,
we
are
in
the
last
class
of
the
individual
components.
So,
let
us
now
look
into
the
other
two
remaining
parts
that
is
expansion
device,
and
the
evaporator .
Since,
we
have
just
completed
condenser ,
and
I
told
you
also
earlier
that,
condenser
and
evaporator ,
both
are
basically
heat
exchangers.
So,
whatever
is
applicable,
more
or
less
in
condenser ,
evaporators
are
also
similar ,
except
the
application,
as
heat
exchanger ,
they
are
similar ,
but
the
application
could
be
a
little
dif ferent,
that
is
why
condenser
is
a
condenser ,
and
evaporator
is
an
evaporator .
So,
let
us
look
into
evaporator
and
expansion
device.
So,
we
go
from
there.
So,
evaporators,
what
is
that?
Evaporators
are
basically
a
heat
exchanger ,
as
I
said
earlier ,
many
times,
the
refrigerant
boils
or
evaporates
in
the
evaporator
and
absorbs
heat
from
the
substance
being
cooled,
which
is
the
main
purpose
of
the
refrigeration
system.
Y es,
exactly
the
same,
why ,
what
is
the
function
of
the
refrigerator
system?
Evaporator
of
a
system
or
refrigeration
system
functions
as
extracting
heat,
right
and
who
is
doing
that?
Evaporator
is
doing
that
right.
So,
the
heat
exchanger
is
called
evaporator ,
because,
the
evaporation
process
occurs
in
the
evaporator ,
whose
evaporation
obviously ,
you
know ,
but
still,
this
is
the
evaporation
of
the
refrigerant,
right,
giving
away
the
latent
heat.
It
is
the
refrigerant
getting
evaporated.
It
can
be
classified
depending
upon
the
heat
transfer
process
or
refrigerant
flow
or
condition
of
the
heat
transfer
surface,
evaporates,
from
the
heat
transfer
surface,
right.
So,
evaporators
can
be
classified
as
natural
and
forced
convection
type,
where,
in
the
natural
convection,
the
fluid
being
cooled,
and
it
flows
due
to
natural
convection
currents
arising
out
of
density
dif ferences
caused
by
the
temperature
dif ference.This
is
true.
Y ou
know ,
how ,
if
you
have
air
conditioner ,
and
you
have
seen
that,
air
conditioner
is
mounted
on
the
top,
if
it
is
split
type,
then
that
is
the
evaporator ,
and
in
that
room,
if
there
is
no
fan,
that
is
forced
circulation.
So,
how
room
is
getting
cooled,
because
hot
air
is
flowing
from
top
to
bottom,
rather ,
the
river ,
sorry ,
the
cold
air
is
flowing
from
top
to
bottom,
and
the
bottom
hot
air
is
going
up
again.
So,
this
way ,
there
is
a
natural
circulation,
and
that
is
what,
in
most
of
the
cases,
not,
mean,
most,
in
all
the
cases
where
there
is
no
fan.
The
refrigerant
boils
inside
tubes
and
is
located
at
the
top
right.
Now ,
the
temperature
of
the
fluid
which
is
cooled
by
the
refrigerant
decreases
and
its
density
increases.
The
cool
fluid
moves
downward,
due
to
the,
due
to
its
higher
density ,
and
the
warm
fluid
rises
up
to
replace
it.
Refrigerant
flow
inside
or
outside
tubes,
depending
on
that,
another
division
of
evaporators.
The
heat
transfer
phenomena,
during
boiling
inside
and
outside
tubes
is
dif ferent.
Again
for
detail
of
the
flow ,
you
can
again
look
into
from
NPTEL,
I
have
a
course
in
that,
where,
fluid
flow ,
we
have
covered,
as
well
as
the
heat
transfer .
So,
accordingly ,
in
classification
of
evaporators,
these
are
classified
as
evaporators
with
refrigerant
flow
inside
the
tubes,
and
those
with
refrigerant
flow
outside
the
tubes.
Evaporators
of
natural
convection
type,
the
evaporators
is
confined
and
boils
inside
the
tubes,
while
the
fluid
being
chilled,
flows
over
the
tubes.
An
example
of
forced
convection
type
of
evaporator ,
where
the
refrigerant
is
confined
inside
the
tube
is,
the
direct
expansion,
called
type
of
evaporators.
Where,
obviously
air
is
directly
cooled
in
contact
with
the
tubes,
cooled
by
refrigerant,
boiling
inside.
In
many
forced
convection
types
of
evaporators,
the
refrigerant
is
kept
in
a
shell
and
tube,
and
rather ,
shell
and
tube
type
heat
exchanger ,
where,
refrigerant
is
in
the
shell
side
and
the
fluid
being
chilled
is
carried
out
in
tubes,
which
are
immersed
in
the
refrigerant,
as
kept
in
shell.
And
the
fluid
being
chilled
is
carried
in
tubes,
which
are
immersed
in
the
refrigerant
shell
rather ,
refrigerant.
So
shell
and
tube
brine,
or
shell
and
tube
brine
chillers,
and
water
chillers,
are
mainly
of
the
evaporators,
of
this
type.
If
the
liquid
refrigerant
covers,
the
entire
heat
transfer
surface
area,
then,
the
heat
exchanger
is
said
to
be
flooded
type
of
evaporator ,
right.
Y ou
will
see,
when
we
will
go
to
ice
cream
manufacturing,
there,
the
ice
cream
freezer ,
it
has
a
flooded
type
of
evaporator ,
which
uses
a
float
type
of
expansion
valve.
When
a
portion
of
the
heat
exchanger
is
used,
for
super
heating
the
refrigerant
vapour ,
after
its
evaporation,
it
is
called
dry
type
of
evaporator ,
which
uses,
of
course,
thermostatic
expansion
valve.
Now ,
natural
convection
coils
are
mainly
used
in
cold
storages,
where,
or
fin
types
of
long
lengths
are
mounted
near
the
ceiling
or
along
the
high
side
walls
of
the
cold
store.This
will
also
come
across,
show
you
the
figures
also,
real,
during
our
cold
store
classes.
From
the
expansion
valve,
the
refrigerant
is
fed
to
these
tubes,
inside
of
which,
the
refrigerant
evaporates
and
cools
the
air ,
whose
density
increases.
Cooled
air
of
high
density
flows
downwards,
through
the
product,
kept
for
cooling,
by
the
time
air
reaches
the
floor
it
becomes
warm,
which
rises
up
through
the
free
area,
like
a
passage,
provided
in
the
cold
store.
However ,
the
same
free
area
for ,
or
the
passage,
is
used
for
loading
and
unloading
the
product,
stored
in
the
cold
room.
And
this
is,
there
is
again,
this
is
also
called,
dry
type
of
evaporator ,
which
uses
thermostatic
valve.
Now ,
these
coils
are
very
useful,
when
low
air
velocities,
and
minimum
de-medication
of
the
product
is
required.
Household
refrigerators
display
cabinets,
walk-in
coolers
reach
in
refrigerators,
and
lar ge
cold
storage,
are
some
of
the
use
of
this
type
of
natural
convection
coils.
Suf ficient
gaps
should
be
provided
between
the
evaporator
and
the
ceiling
to
permit
air
circulation
over
top
of
the,
over
top
of
the
coil.
Some
baf fles
are
also
provided
to
separate
the
warm
air
and
the
cold
air ,
and
single
ceiling
mounted
evaporators
are
used
for
rooms
of
width
less
than
2.5
meter .
Now ,
in
the
flooded
evaporator
type,
for
lar ge
ammonia
systems,
these
types
of
evaporators
are
used.
The
refrigerant
enters
a
sur ge
drum
through
a
float
type
expansion
valve.
The
flash
vapour
formed
during
expansion
is
drawn
directly
by
the
compressor .
The
vapour
does
not
take
part
in
cooling
the
product.
Hence,
its
removal
makes
the
evaporator
more
compact
and
pressure
drop
due
to
this
is
also
avoided.
From
the
bottom
of
the
sur ge
drum,
liquid
refrigerant
enters
the
evaporator ,
as
heat
is
absorbed
by
the
refrigerant,
it
boils
inside
the
tubes.
The
mixture
of
liquid
and
vapour
bubbles
rises
up
along
the
evaporator
tubes.
As
the
vapour
enters
the
sur ge
drum,
it
is
separated,
and
the
remaining
evaporated
liquid
is
re-circulated
in
the
tubes
along
with
the
constant
supply
of
liquid
refrigerant
from
the
expansion
valve.
If
m
dot
is
the
mass
flow
rate
through
the
expansion
valve
to
the
compressor ,
the
mass
flow
rate
in
the
evaporator
tube
is
also
a
function
of
m
dot,
where
‘f ’
is
called
re-circulation
factor .
Now ,
let
x
expansion
is
the
quality
of
mixture,
after
the
expansion
valve,
and
x
b
is
the
quality
of
mixture
after
boiling
in
the
evaporator .
The
mass
flow
rate
from
the
expansion
valve
at
steady
state
is
same
as
the
mass
flow
rate
to
the
compressor .
Hence,
from
the
conservation
of
mass,
we
can
write,
x
evaporated
dot
times
m
dot
plus
x
b
f
m
dot
f
m
correction
factor
is
equal
to
m
dot
right.
If
x
expansion
and
x
b
equals
to
0.2,
the
circulation
factor
is
4.
This
means,
the
mass
flow
rate
through
the
evaporator
is
4
times
that
through
the
compressor .
Therefore
f
is
1
minus
x
expansion
over
x
b.
The
liquid
refrigerant
is
always
in
contact
with
whole
of
the
evaporator
surface,
which,
makes
the
evaporator
more
ef fective.
Apump
may
increase
the
heat
transfer
coef ficient,
since
the
lubricating
oil
may
tend
to
accumulate
in
the
flooded
evaporator
and
oil
separator
is
normally
be
used
immediately
after
the
compressor .
Its
application
is
in
most
of
the
cold
rooms
with
a
ceiling
fan
over
the
tubes
to
circulate
the
air .
T o
increase
the
heat
transfer
coef ficient,
the
tubes
may
also
be
fitted
with
fins.
Another
type
is
the
shell
and
tube
sealers
obviously ,
there
will
be
some
shell
and
tube
in
the
sense,
I
have
shown
you
earlier
in
the
in
the
condenser ,
right.
There
was,
whether
it
is
series
or
parallel,
or
rather
it
is
parallel,
or
parallel,
or
counter
current
flow ,
depending
on
that,
I
had
shown
you,
right.
Since,
our
time
is
limited,
so,
I
am
skipping
it.
For
small
and
medium
tonnage
of
refrigeration
capacity ,
dry
expansion
type
of
evaporators
is
used,
ranging
from
2
to
350
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
The
flooded
type
is
available
in
lar ger
capacities,
ranging
from
10
to
several
thousands
of
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
So,
there,
we
use
shell
and
coil
sealer ,
double
pipe
sealer ,
direct
expansion
coil
and
plate
surface
evaporators.
Now ,
after
evaporator ,
of
course,
it
should
have
been
before
evaporator ,
as
our ,
as
our ,
this
circuit
is
concerned,
expansion
valve
is
before
evaporator .
However ,
as
I
said
that
both
evaporator
and
the
condenser
are
the
heat
exchangers.
So,
I
covered
from
condenser
expansion
evaporator .
Now ,
we
come
to
the
expansion
valve.
This
is
very
much
useful,
and
its
usefulness
is
like
this,
to
reduce
the
pressure
from
the
condenser
to
the
evaporator
pressure,
and
to
control
the
mass
flow
rate,
according
to
some
predetermined
criteria.
Its
importance
is
like
this,
mass
flow
rate
in
the
system
should
be
proportional
to
the
cooling
load
on
the
plant
under
ideal
conditions.
If
the
product
to
be
cooled
is
required
to
be
maintained
at
a
constant
evaporator
temperature,
or
if
the
liquid
refrigerant
should
not
enter
the
compressor ,
the
mass
flow
rate
has
to
be
controlled
in
such
a
way ,
in
such
a
manner ,
that
only
the
superheated
vapour
leaves
the
evaporator .
Now ,
if
you
remember
our ,
this
circuit,
that
1
2
3
4,
this
was
1
2
3
4,
right.
This
4
to
1
is
the
evaporator ,
this
2
to
3
is
the
condenser ,
and
1
to
2
is
the
compressor ,
and
this
is
the
expansion
device,
right.
This
is
the
hot
liquid
coming,
right,
ok.
Let
me
go
to
some
other
place,
otherwise,
this
part
is
being
used.
So,
let
me
go
to
this
part,
that,
we
have
this
expansion
device,
here.
So,
there,
it
is
liquid,
here
at
high
temperature
and
high
pressure,
which
is
reduced
to
low
temperature
and
low
pressure,
right
and
after
this,
it
is
going
to
the
evaporator .
Now ,
this
evaporator
when
it
is
going
to
the
compressor
after
the
evaporator ,
when
it
is
going
to
the
compressor ,
that
time,
it
should
be,
like
this,
before
it
is
entering
to
the
compressor ,
it
must
be
superheated,
otherwise,
you
have
the
compressor
with
wet
compression.
So,
to
avoid
that,
it
has
to
be
superheated,
that
is
what
is
the
function
of
the
expansion
device,
so
that,
the
mass
flow
rate
is
controlled
in
such
a
way
that,
after
extracting
theevaporator
heat,
it
is
getting
superheated
before
it
enters
into
the
compressor ,
right.
So,
an
ideal
refrigerant,
and
ideal
refrigerant
system
should
have
the
facility
control
the
mass
flow
rate
in
such
a
way ,
the
ener gy
requirement
is
minimum,
and
both
the
required
circulator ,
circulation
of
the
temperature
and
cooling
load
are
satisfied.
Some
additional
control,
to
control
the
capacity
of
the
compressor
and
the
space
temperature
may
be
required,
as
well
as,
or
rather ,
as
well,
so
as
to
minimize
the
ener gy
consumption.
T wo
basic
types
of
controls
on
the
compressor
are
there,
for
example,
on
of f
control
and
the
proportional
control,
right.
Obviously ,
on
of f
control
means,
you
are
switching
on
or
of f.
This
is
on
of f
control.
Proportional
control
means,
acquiring
two
requirements.
It
is
proportional,
right.
Of
course,
the
expansion
valve
used
in
refrigeration
system
has
to
be
compatible
with
the
overall
control
systems.
Now ,
the
types
of
expansion
valves
are,
there
are
five
types,
and
these
are
capillary
tube,
then,
automatic
expansion
valve,
this
maintains
a
constant
temperature
in
the
evaporator ,
load
type
of
expansion
valve,
where
it
can
be
high
pressure
side
float
valve
which
maintains
a
constant
level
of
refrigerant
in
the
evaporator ,
or
low
pressure
side
float
valve
that
maintains
a
constant
level
of
refrigerant
in
the
evaporator ,
right.
Automatic
expansion
valve,
that
also
is
there,
so
these
are
the
types
of
expansion
valve.
Now ,
in
capillary
type,
it
is
a
constant
diameter
narrow
tube,
or
bed,
tube
serves
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
pressure
in
a
refrigerant
system.
I
said
in
one
of
the
classes,
that,
from
high
pressure,
when
it
is
flowing
through
a
narrow
space,
then,
it
throttles,
the
temperature
drops,
right,
and
that
is
exactly
here,
which
is
happening.
So,
from
the
high
pressure
condenser ,
when
it
is
passing
through
narrow ,
very
narrow
capillary
tubes,
then
the
pressure
drops
so
much,
and
there
is
a
reduction
in
temperature
significantly .
The
refrigerant
has
to
overcome
the
frictional
resistance
of fered
by
the
capillary
tube
or
tube
walls
leading
to
some
pressure
drop.
The
liquid
refrigerant
flashes,
that
is,
vaporizes
into
mixture
of
liquid
and
vapor ,
at
the
pressure,
as
the
pressure
reduces,
rather .
The
density
of
vapor
is
less
than
that
of
the
liquid.
In
the
evaporator ,
the
average
density
of
the
refrigerant
decreases,
as
it
flows
in
the
capillary
tube,
the
mass
flow
rate,
and
the
capillary
tube
diameter .
Hence,
the
area
being
constant,
the
velocity
of
the
refrigerant
increases,
this
is
because,
m
dot
is
equal
to
rho
into
v
into
A,
this
increases
in
velocity ,
this
increase
in
velocity ,
or
acceleration
of
the
refrigerant
also
requires
a
pressure
drop.
Though
in
capillary ,
surface
in
capillary ,
rather ,
surface
tension
is
an
important
property ,
but,
in
this
case,
it
is
not
required.
Generally ,
the
tube
diameter
range
from
0.4
millimeter
to
2
millimeter
and
the
length
ranges
from
0.6
to
6
meter .
Once,
the
capillary
tube
of
required
dimension
is
selected,
for
a
refrigeration
system,
the
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant,
through
it
will
vary
in
such
way
that
the
local
pressure
drop,
or
rather ,
total
pressure
drop
through
it,
matches
the
pressure
dif ferences
between
the
condenser
and
the
evaporator .
For
a
given
bore
and
length
of
a
capillary
tube,
I
hope,
bore
you
understand,
now ,
we
have
already
said
earlier
also,
that
this
is
the
bore,
right
this
is
the
bore,
or
diameter ,
that
is
the
bore,
which
we
have
also
said
in
the
compressor ,
if
you
remember
correctly ,
right,
sorry ,
if
you
remember
correctly .
Now ,
the
mass
flow
rate
through
it,
a
bore,
and
length
of
the
capillary ,
ok,
for
a
given
bore
and
length
of
a
capillary
tube,
the
mass
flow
rate
through
it
is
totally
dependent
upon
the
pressure
dif ference
across
the
capillary
tube.
This
means
the
mass
flow
rate
cannot
adjust
itself
in
response
to
variation
in
load,
right.
So,
this
is
how
we
have
covered
the
expansion
valve
and
evaporator
and
by
this
we
have
completed
the
individual
parts
of
the
refrigeration
system.
W e
have
completed
compressors,
we
have
completed
condensers,
we
have
completed
together
evaporator ,
and
the
expansion
device
right.
So,
our
production
of
cool
is
over ,
method
of
production,
why
we
want
to
produce
these
are
all
over ,
we
are
left
with
the
application
of
the
production
of
the
cold,
what
do
we
do
by
producing
that,
also
you
should
know
that
also,
should
be
a
part
of
it,
right.
W e
have
already
said
that
why
we
need,
we
said
how
we
produce
and
what
are
the
requirements,
all
these
we
have
all
said,
now ,
we
are
left
with
the
application
of
this
produced
cold,
right
and
this
will
follow
in
subsequent
classes.
Thank
you
very
much.
