Practical
Difficulties
with
Carnot
Cycle
Good
afternoon,
my
friends
and
students.
If
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
class,
we
had
shown
the
COP
of
Carnot,
and
today
we
shall
discuss
with
the
practical
dif ficulties
with
Carnot
cycle,
right.
It
is
true
that,
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle
is
one
of
the
best,
right.
Then,
why
it
is
not
used?
If
Carnot
is
the
best,
obviously ,
you
will
always
try
to
use
the
best
one.
So,
then,
why
it
is
not
commercially
used,
that
comes
the
question?
So,
you
are
the
best
boy ,
and
if
you
are
not
given
opportunity
to
work,
then
what
is
the
fun
of
you
being
the
best
boy?
This
is
a
definitely
automatic
question,
which
comes
to
everybody's
mind,
that
Carnot
cycle
is
the
best
cycle
but
cannot
be
used.
It
is
taken
as
the
highest,
for
comparison,
or
best,
for
comparison,
then,
in
spite
of
that,
why
we
are
not
using
Carnot?
COP
is
very
high,
rather
the
highest
COP
you
can
obtain,
then,
even,
we
are
not
using
it,
why?
This,
why
reply
comes
from
the
dif ficulties
of
using
Carnot
cycles.
Y es,
there
is
no
ambiguity
that,
the
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle
is
the
best
cycle,
which,
we
can
think
of,
and
which,
we
can
tar get,
that,
we
should
be
able
to
reach
this,
our
COP
will
be
maximum,
and
power
consumption
also
accordingly
will
be
low .
Then,
for
commercial
application,
this
could
be
the
best,
but
unfortunately ,
it
could
not
be,
because
of
the
dif ficulties,
or
practical
dif ficulties,
associated
with
the
Carnot
cycle,
right.
If
you
remember
the
cycle,
which
we
had
shown
you
earlier ,
if
you
remember
that,
in
a
TS
diagram,
if
this
was
the
T ,
and
if
this
was
the,
S
and
if
this
was
the
vapour
dome,
right
then,
our
point
started
from
here,
went
up,
went
left,
came
down,
and
this
was
our
point
1,
point
2,
point
3,
and
point
4,
right.
So,
in
this
cycle,
you
see
that,
this
was
the
compressor
work,
right.
So,
compressor
is
getting
liquid,
as
the
input,
right.
This
point
is
the
inlet
to
the
compressor .
I,
sorry ,
compressor ,
and
this
point
is
the
outlet
from
the
compressor ,
right,
and
then,
it
goes
to
the
condenser ,
gets
liquefied,
then
it
comes
back,
after
expansion
through
throttling,
lowering
down
the
temperature,
as
you
require,
accordingly ,
you
are
throttling
and
then,
it
is
giving
your
whatever
work
you
have
done
corresponding
to
that
you
are
getting
the
refrigeration
ef fect.
So,
if
these
be
true,
then
what
is
the
problem?
Problem
lies,
here
is
that,
it
is
dif ficult
to
build
and
operate
a
Carnot
refrigeration
system
due
to
the
reasons,
which
are
very
dif ficult
practically .
Thereason
number
1,
we
can
say
that,
during
the
process
1
to
2,
this
process,
which
I
will
be
referring
to,
during
the
process
1
to
2,
a
mixture
consisting
of
liquid
and
vapour
have
to
be
compressed
isentropically ,
this
is
S.
So,
this
is
entropy ,
constant.
So,
isentropically ,
it
has
to
be
compressed
in
the
compressor .
Such
a
compressor
is
known
as
wet
compressor ,
this
compression
1
to
2
is
known
as
wet
compression,
and
this
is
why
wet
compression,
because
there
is
a
presence
of
liquid
in
it,
because,
it
is
a
mixture
of
vapour
and
liquid.
So,
in
practice,
wet
compression
is
very
dif ficult,
especially
with
reciprocating
type
of
compressors,
when
we
will
come
to
compressor ,
typically ,
that
time
you
will
see
that,
reciprocating
type
of
compressors
are
commonly
used
commercially
in
most
of
the
cases,
right.
So,
reciprocating
type
of
compressors
is
very
dif ficult,
if
it
is
handling
liquid
refrigerant
in
the
compressor ,
right.
So,
I
say
again,
for
your
benefit
that,
in
the
T -S
diagram,
which
we
have
seen,
the
dome
or
dome
was
like
this,
right
and
we
started
from
here,
there,
there,
there.
So,
this
was
point
1,
this
was
point
2,
and
this
is
under
compression
condition,
right.
So,
when,
the
this
is
the
inlet
to
the
compressor ,
and
this
is
the
outlet
from
the
compressor ,
right,
this
is
showing
that
the
compressor
has
to
handle,
this
is
a
mixture
of
vapour
liquid,
so,
some
liquid,
compressor
is
bound
to
work,
or
is
supposed
to
work
with
vapour ,
no
problem,
but
if
there
is
liquid,
then
that
becomes
very
dif ficult
for
the
compressor ,
which
is
working
with
reciprocating
type,
right.
Obviously ,
reciprocating
type,
I
had
given
you
one
example,
that
you
use
during
the
holy ,
that
one,
plunger
kind
of
thing
right.
So,
you
are
taking
some
colour
water
and
forcing
it.
So,
there,
you
are
compressing
and
when,
you
are
withdrawing
liquid
then
you
are
sucking,
right.
That
is
what
it
is
happening.
Suction
is
here,
and
dischar ge
is
here,
right.
So,
if
in
the
suction
period,
we
have
vapour
and
liquid
mixture,
then
compressor
is
not
able
to
handle.
Such
kind
of
compressors
are
very
dif ficult
to
develop.
So,
this
is
the
first
negative
point
of
the
Carnot
cycle,
Carnot
system,
right.
Now ,
next
one
is
that,
this
problem
is
practically
severe,
in
case
of
high
speed
reciprocating
compressor .
The
one,
which,
I
gave
you,
just
example,
that,
you
are
playing,
during
the
holi
with
coloured,
or
colourful
water ,
or
some
liquid,
right,
but
that
time
you
are
making
both
the
compression,
as
well
as
suction
slowly .
A
similar
one,
suppose,
like
in
fast
forward
mode,
you
see,
any
picture,
then,
your ,
how
it
will
look
like,
your ,
this
coming,
and
going,
it
will
be
very
very
very
fast
right.
Even,
much
faster ,
is
the
actual
reciprocating
type.
So,
where,
the
speed
of
the
compressor
is
very
high,
right,
where,
the
speed
of
the
compressor
is
very ,
very
high.
So,
this
get
damaged
due
to
the
presence
of
liquid
dropletsin
the
vapour .
Even
though,
some
types
of
compressors,
can
tolerate
the
presence
of
liquid
in
vapour ,
even
though,
this
is
very
very
dif ficult.
Since,
reciprocating
compressors
are
most
widely
used
in
refrigeration,
some
part,
which,
some
part
of
the
compressors,
which,
can
take
care
of
this
problem,
that
does
not
come
into
solution.
Because,
reciprocating
type
of
compressors
are
very
widely ,
or
commonly
used,
which,
having
very
high
speed,
is
not
possible
to
handle
this
liquid
mixture
in
the
inlet
of
the
compressor .
T raditionally ,
dry
compression,
that
is
compression
of
vapour
only ,
is
preferred,
over
wet
compression,
right.
So,
I
am
regularly
showing
you
the
Carnot
cycle
in
T -S
diagram
right.
So,
you
should
not
for get,
because,
it
is
very
dif ficult
to
ask
you
question,
the
pattern,
which
are
given
to
us
for
making
their
such
type
of
building,
or
rather
not
building
such
type
of
photo
or
figure
is
dif ficult
to
give.
So,
that
is
why ,
so
that,
it
is
in
your
mind.
I
am
repeatedly
showing
you
that,
in
the
T -S
diagram
this
was
the
dome,
and
we
started
with
0.1,
then
0.2,
then
0.3
and
then
0.4
right.
So,
we
are
giving
inlet
to
the
compressor ,
vapour
liquid
mixture.
So,
that,
this,
as
we
said,
the
reciprocating
compressors
cannot
handle,
right,
though
there
are
few
compressors,
or
some
compressors,
which
can
handle
liquid,
but
they
are
not
commercially ,
so
widely
used.
So,
obviously ,
the
one,
which
you
are
using
commercially ,
you
will
look
for
its
best
solution,
right.
So,
it
is
preferred
that,
over
wet
compression,
dry
compression
is
always
preferred,
dry
compression,
means,
where,
only
vapour
is
there.
Then,
for
which,
you,
what
you
need
to
do?
Y ou
need
to
again,
let
us
draw
that
T -S,
and
the
dome
right,
earlier ,
it
was
like
this.
Now ,
you
need
to
transfer
this
0.1
from
here
to
there,
and
then,
you
can
do
the
compression,
like
this,
right.
So,
this
could
be
one
such
solution,
will
come,
will
come
in
detail
afterwards.
Let
us
first
finish,
the
other
dif ficulties,
associated
with
the
Carnot
refrigeration
system.
The
second
dif ficulty
is
that,
the
second
dif ficulty
is
that,
with
Carnot
cycle,
it
is
using
a
turbine,
and
extracting
work
from
the
system,
during
the
isentropic
expansion,
right,
of
liquid
refrigerant,
and
this
is
not
economically
feasible,
right.
Similarly ,
in
case
of
small
captive
system,
this
could
be
very
very
inef fective,
or
rather ,
inef fective,
or
economically
not
feasible.
So,
what
we
are
saying?
W e
are
saying
that,
we
have,
sorry ,
we
are
saying
that,
we
have
this
T -S,
this
is
T ,
this
is
S.
That
part
1,
we
have
already
taken
care
of,
said,
it
will,
if
it
is
transferred
to
there,
but
this
part,
that
is,
the
expansion,
right,
this
was
the
expansion
part
and
using
turbine
and
liquid,
with
here,
also
it
is
liquid,
liquid
with
turbine,
and
that
is
also,
a
compressor ,
that
is
very ,
and
using
isentropic
process,
it
is
a
very
much
expensive.
It
is
very
much
expensive,
and
it
is
not
economical.
So,
second
point
also,
we
have
looked
into
right,
why
Carnot
being
so
highly
impressive
cycle,
andwhich
one
is
taken
as
the
best
cycle,
in
spite
of
that,
it
is
not
used
commercially .
So,
we
have
said,
two
dif ficulties,
let
us
look
into
others.
Third
one
is,
before
that,
we
have
said,
isentropically ,
it
is
expanded,
with
the
turbine.
So,
what
it
says,
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that,
why
it
is
not
economical,
due
to
the
fact
that
the
specific
work
output,
specific
work,
the
moment,
it
is
we
said,
per
kg
right.
So,
specific
work
output,
that
is
per
kilogram
of
the
refrigerant,
from
that
turbine,
can
be
given
as
W
3
to
4
is
integral
of
V
dp,
within
the
domain
of
Pe
to
Pc
right.
So,
within
the
domain
of
Pe
to
Pc.
So,
there
was
a
negative
for
which
it
is
supposed
to
be
from
Pc
to
Pe
actually .
It
is
supposed
to
be
from
Pc
to
Pe,
right
because,
that
is
what
you
are
doing,
you
are
compressing
from,
repeat,
T s
right.
So,
you
are,
this
is
the
point
3,
and
this
is
the
point
4,
right.
So,
from
point
3,
you
are
doing
that
turbine,
and
it
is
doing
from
point
3
to
point
4,
expansion,
right.
So,
it
is
Pc
to
Pe,
that
is
to
be,
but
there
it
is
minus
V
dp,
right,
because
dp
is
decreasing,
Pc
is
high,
and
Pe
is
low .
So,
it
is
minus
V
dp,
and
to
take
care
of
this
minus,
we
have
made
it
plus,
and
change
the
limit
from
Pe
to
Pc,
V
dp,
right.
So,
what
is
that?
dp
is
becoming,
or
pressure
is
becoming
very
very
low ,
at
the
output
of
the
turbine,
from
high
pressure
to
a
very
low
pressure,
for
which,
the
liquid
is
expanded,
and
the
temperature
is
reduced,
right.
So,
this
is
why
it
is
very
dif ficult
for
the
turbine,
right,
and
as
you
know
that
this
volume
for
the
gas
is
high,
but
volume
for
the
liquid
is
very
low .
So,
that
V
dp,
which
you
are
integrating.
So,
there
the
value
becomes
very
low ,
and
it
is
very
dif ficult
to
use
economically ,
the
turbine
as
the
expansion
device
right.
Then
since
the
specific
volume
of
liquid
is
much
smaller ,
compared
to
the
specific
volume
of
gases,
or
vapours,
right.
So,
the
work
output
from
the
turbine,
in
case
of
the
liquid,
will
be
very
small,
right,
this
I
just
told.
Then,
the
net
output
will
be
further
reduced,
because,
that
V
dp
is,
for
the
liquid,
is
very
very
very
low .
As
a
result,
using
a
turbine
for
extracting
the
work
from
the
high
pressure
liquid
is
not
economically
justified,
and
this
is
true
for
most
of
the
cases,
right.
However ,
currently ,
some
ef forts
are
being
done,
so
that
this
dif ficulty
can
be
improved
by
the
system
ef ficiency
right.
So,
we
have
done
3
such
dif ficulties.
So,
one
way
of
achieving
this
is
dry
compression,
in
control
refrigeration,
rather ,
in
Carnot
refrigeration,
is
to
have
2
compressors,
one
isentropic,
and
one
isothermal.
So,
this
is
also
shown,
subsequently
we
will
show
you.
So,
this
is
the
T -S
diagram,
we
said
that
one
isentropic
and
one
isothermal.
So,
we
have
shifted,
if
you
remember ,
we
have
shifted
the
point
here.
So,
this
point,
this
is
isentropic
compression.
So,
from
there,
if
it
is
done
isothermally ,
and
then
isothermal,
this
was
there,
right
and
subsequently ,
it
will
come
here,
and
there
may
be,
this
is
one
such
improvement,
which
we
are
talking
about.
But,
in
reality ,
when
in
future,
you
will
see
that,
there
are
also
some
dif ficulties,
for
this
kind
of
system
right.
So,
we
say
that,
though,
we
are
in
2
stages,
right,
or
2
compressors,
one
isentropic,
and
one
isothermal,
can
handle
the
dry
compression,
instead
of
wet,
fine,
that,
we
are
taking
it,
right.
So,
this
will
come
back
again.
Another ,
thing
which,
I
would
like
to
say ,
perhaps,
yeah
this
also
should
have
been
said
here.
What
is
that?
That,
we
are
saying
that,
we
are
saying
that,
during
this
compression,
that
liquid
is
coming
to
the
compressor
valves,
right.
There
is
a
piston,
and
this
is
one
end,
and
that
is
another
end,
ok.
There
is
a
valve
here,
there
is
also
a
valve
here,
in
the
inlet
and
in
the
outlet.
So,
this
goes
on
reciprocating,
right.
So,
when,
it
is
done,
that
time,
what
is
happening,
the
liquid
droplets,
they
are
at
a
very
high
speed,
and
they
go
and
hit.
This
is,
these
are,
the
compressors,
these
are
the
compressor
inlet
and
outlet
path.
The
material,
by
which
it
is
made
of,
so,
there,
this
liquid
droplets,
hits,
like
a
bullet.
So,
a
continuous
impact
of
such
bullets
will
make
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
compressor
very
high.
So,
every
now
and
then,
you
may
need
to
change
the
compressor ,
and
make
the
repair
for
the
next
operation.
This
is
again,
another
drawback,
because
of
the
wet
compression,
right.
That
it
is
hitting
the
valve
of
the
compressor
very
high,
at
a
very
high
speed,
and
the
liquid
hits
it
like
a
bullet.
So,
that
is
damaging
the
compressor
sheet,
and
is
not
justifiable,
otherwise,
your ,
wear
and
tear
will
be
very
very
high,
right.
So,
we
have
said
that,
what
are
the
dif ficulties
of
Carnot
system
using
commercially ,
right.
Our
time
is
over
today .
Thank
you
for
listening
very
good.,
