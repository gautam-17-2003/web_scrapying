Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
Good
afternoon
my
dear
students.
If
you
remember
in
the
previous
class
we
started
with
basics
of
thermodynamics
and
in
that
we
saw
that
heat
transfer ,
fluid
flow,
things
are
also
coming.
A
little
of
heat
transfer ,
I
had
already
said
and
maybe
at
the
end
of
this
basics
of
thermodynamics
may
take
some
classes.
So
before
that
let
us
look
at
the
flow
through
the conduit or flow through pipe.
Now ,
this,
I
had
given
you
yesterday
I
mean
in
the
last
class
and
I
told
that
there
are
two
types
of
force
transfer ,
one
is
by
bulk
movement
of
the
molecules
and
the
other
is
by
the
molecular
transport,
that
also
I
had
explained
to
you,
right.
So
assuming
that
we
know
molecular
transport
and
we
know
bulk
flow
or
bulk
transfer
then
let
us
take
this
as
a
sample
that
is
section
of
a
pipe
in
which
we
are
taking
a
volume
element
of
radius
delta
r
thickness
rather
and
the
length
we
are
taking
as
delta
x
right
and
as
you
see
this
r
and
x
this is the r and this is x right.
So
I
can
show
you
that
this
is
the
r
direction
and
this
is
the
x
direction
right
and
the
thickness
we
have
taken
as
delta
r,
we
have
taken
the
length
as
delta
x.
So,
this
means
there,
this
is
two
dimension
and
the
third
dimension
is
taken
as
unit
right.
So
if
we
do
the
momentum
balance,
let
me
clear
up,
if
we
do
the
momentum
balance
then
what
we
get,
again
we
have
to
come
back,
if
you
do
momentum
balance,
then
what
we
get
we
said
that,
we
will
be
ge
sorry ,
we
will
be
getting,
if
you
are
doing
shell
momentum
balance
which
is
valid
for
incompressible
fluid,
this
also
I
said
that
incompressible
fluid
means
that,
the
fluid
which
does
not
change
its
density
with
time
or
rather
with
pressure,
right
that
is
incompressible.
Compressible
fluids
do
change
their
density
with
pressure,
but
incompressible
does
not
and
the
flow
is
one
dimensional,
it
is
a
steady
state
laminar
flow
fully
developed
that
also
we
said,
and
there
is
no
end
effects
and
velocity
profile
does
not vary along the x axis or  x direction, right.
So,
the
governing
equation
that
we
can
write,
as
governing
equation
that
we
can
write
as
momentum,
rate
of
momentum
in,
rate
of
momentum
in
minus
rate
of
momentum
out
plus
sum
of
the
forces
acting
on
the
volume
element
must
be
equal
to
rate
of
accumulation
of
momentum.
This
is
the
general
equation
for
solving
the
flow
through
pipe
equation.
Now ,
we
have
already
said
that
it
is
a
steady
state.
So,
momentum
in
by
convection
is
equal
to
momentum
out
by
convection.
So,
they
are
cancelling
out
each
other , right.
So
there
is
no
then
convective
momentum
left
over
because
whatever
was
coming
is
also
going
out.
So
momentum
in
by
convection
equal
to
momentum
out
by
convection
that
is
why,
because
of
steady
state.
Now
momentum
in
by
molecular
transport,
we
can
write
that,
it
is
equal
to
tau
r
x
into
2
pi
r
into
delta
x
at
the
position
r.
If
we
go
back
to
the
previous
slide,
where
we
had,
this
slide,
you
see
how
we
are
finding
out
the
area.
We
are finding out that 2 pi r , right into delta x, right.
τrx
2
π
r 
∆
x |r
This
we
are
getting
for
the
momentum
flux
ok.
So,
we
are
getting
2
pi
r
into
delta
x
at
the
face
r,
right.
So
at
the
face
r
it
is
so.
So
what
about
at
the
face
r
plus
del
r?
If
you
remember ,
I
am
drawing
it
here,
it
was
our
thing,
right
and
this
was
our
thing
right,
and
we
had
taken
delta
r
like
this,
and
this
was
delta
x
right.
So,
2
pi
r
delta
x
that
is
the
area
at the face r into the tau r x right.
τrx
.2
π
r 
∆
x |
r+ 
∆
r
So,
this
of
course,
you
know
tau
r
x,
what
is
that
tau
r
x
is?
It
is
not
going
out,
let
it
be.
So,
the
other
one
is
momentum
out
by
molecular
transport
that
is
tau
r
x
into
2
pi
r
into
delta
x
at
r
is
equal
to
r
plus
delta
r.
This
is
the
momentum
out
by
molecular
transportright.
This
tau
r
x
is
nothing,
but
shear
stress,
right
this
is
nothing,
but
shear
stress
and
of
course,
it
has
a
definition,
and
we
define
it
after
words,
we
will
come
it
that
momentum
out
and
momentum
in
due
to
molecular
transport,
we
have
seen
one
is
tau
r
x
rather ,
into
2
pi
r
into
delta
x
at
r
is
equal
to
r
and
tau
r
x
into
2
pi
r
into
delta
x
at
r
plus
delta
r.
So,
this is the force for molecular transport.
Now ,
there
are
other
forces
like
pressure
force.
So,
pressure
force
is
also
similarly
working
at
p
at
x
is
equal
to
x
and
that
is
equal
to
p
times
the
area,
what
is
the
area?
Area
is
2
pi
r
into
delta
r
at
the
face
x
right,
that
is
the
pressure
force.
Similarly ,
we
can
say
pressure
force
at
the
outlet
that
is
p
at
x
plus
delta
x.
so
that
we
write
p
times
the
area
that
is
2
pi
r
delta
r
at
x
plus
delta
x.
So,
if
we
know
this
then
pressure
forces
are
known,
molecular
transport
forces
are
known
and
there
is
also
gravity
force,
but
since
we
have
taken one horizontal tube right.
Pressur e force in = P|x= p
2
π
r 
∆
r |x
Pressur e force out = P|
x+ 
∆
x= p
2
π
r 
∆
r|
x+
∆
x
So,
we
can
neglect
the
gravitational
force,
gravity .
So,
neglecting
gravity
because
it
is
not
there,
we
can
then
write
in
the
governing
equation
that
tau
r
x
into
2
pi
r
into
delta
x
at
r
is
equal
to
r
minus
tau
pi
r
x
into
2
pi
r
delta
x
at
r
is
equal
to
r
plus
delta
r
plus
p
into
2
pi
r
into
delta
r
at
x
minus
p
2
pi
r
into
delta
r
at
x
plus
delta
x,
right
this
is
equal
to
0
right.
So,
this
is
equal
to
0.
So,
if
we
rearrange,
it
you
know
by
the
definition
of
derivative,
derivative
is,
how
it
is
made?
It
is
out,
sorry ,
it
is
out
minus
in
over
the
distance,
right
that
is,
what
is,
any
derivative,
out
minus
in
over
the
distance.
Now ,
if
we
say
that,
dividing
both
side
by
delta
x
into
delta
r,
if
we
divide
both
sides
by
delta
x
and
delta
r,
then
we
can
write
this
r
tau
r
x
at
r
is
equal
to
r
plus
delta
r
minus
r
tau
r
x
at
r
is
equal to r over delta r .
∴

∆
r  = r (p|x-p|x+
∆

) / 
∆

or, 
∂
(r
τrx
) /
∂
r = - r 
∂
p /
∂
x = (
∆
p/L) r
or, r
τrx
= (
∆
p/L) r2/2 + c
or, 
τrx
= (
∆
p/L) r/2 + c/rThis
is
equal
to
p
at
x
minus
p
at
x
plus
delta
x
over
delta
x
right.
So,
we
can
write,
from
the
definition
of
derivative,
that
del
del
r
of
r
tau
r
x
equal
to
minus
r
del
p
del
x,
equal
to
delta
p
over
L,
that
p
at
x
plus
delta
x,
right,
and
p
at
x,
this
difference,
we
can
write,
to
be
delta
p,
right.
So,
we
can
write
that
del
del
r
of
r
tau
r
x
is
equal
to
minus
r
del
p
del
x
and
that
is
equal
to
del
p
over
L
into
r,
right.
So,
this
on
rearrangement,
we
can
write,
r
tau
r
x
is
equal
to
delta
p
by
L
into
r
square
by
2
plus
integration
constant,
as
c
right.
So
we
have
to find out what is the value of  c that is the integration constant.
We
have
not
done.
It
is
not
a
definite
integration.
It
is
indefinite
integration.
So
we
need
a
constant
c
to
be
evaluated.
So,
one
unknown
so
we
need
one
equation,
as
boundary
condition, right.
So
this
on
rearrangement
we
can
write
tau
r
x
is
equals
to
delta
p
over
L
into
r
by
2
plus
c
by
r
this
is
the
tau
r
x
that
we
are
looking
for.
Now
the
boundary ,
we
need
to
know
the
boundary ,
and
that
boundary
is
at
r
is
equal
to
0
since
tau
r
x
is
not
equal
to
infinity ,
therefore,
c
is
0.
We
go
back
to
the
previous
slide,
here
we
had
said
that
tau
r
x,
right
is
equal
to
delta
p
by
L
into
r
by
2
plus
c
by
r
and
we
need
to
find
out
the
constant
c
and
that
is
only
possible
by
knowing
the
boundary
condition
and
boundary
condition
is
what?
Boundary
condition
is
at
r
is
equal
to
0
since
tau
r
x
that
is
the
tangential
force
or
what
we
call
it
to
be
the
shear
force,
which
we
are
coming
across
with
layer
by
layer
or
molecules
by
molecules.
So,
that
is
the
tau
r
x
and
since
it
is
not
infinity ,
therefore
c
has
to
be
0
at
r
is
equal
to
0,
otherwise,
if
it
is
infinite,
then
obviously
it
would
be
very
very
difficult
to
solve,
right,
it
becomes
a
mathematical
problem.
So,
to
avoid
that
the
best
boundary is taken that at r is equal to 0, since tau r x is  not infinity therefore c is 0.
at r = 0, since 
τ
rx
≠  ∞ ,   c  =  0
∴
τrx=
(
∆
p/L) r/2,
∴
and since 
τrx
= - 
μ
 
dvx/ dr
μ
 
dvx
/dr = - (
∆
p/L) r/2
or, dvx
/dr = - (
∆
p/2
μ
L).r
or, Vx=
- (
∆
p /2
μ
L) r2/2 +c1
Then
we
can
write
tau
r
x
we
can
write
tau
r
x
is
equal
to
delta
p
by
L
into
r
by
2.
This
we
remember .
In
future,
not
only
here,
but
in
any
other ,
maybe,
whenever
you
are
doing
any
other
fluid
flow,
this
in
many
cases,
you
start
with
this,
right,
if
the
other
conditionsremain
similar .
So,
tau
r
x
is
equal
to
delta
p
by
L
into
r
by
2
right.
Now
we
define
tau
r
x, right.
Here
you
see
tau
is
associated
with
2,
one
is
r
another
is
x,
right,
and
first
one
is
r
with
tau
second
one
is
x,
right.
So,
when
it
is
defined,
tau
is
defined,
it
is
said
that
it
is
equal
to
minus
mu,
that
is
viscosity ,
minus
mu
into
dv
x
dr
right.
So
the
second
one
is
the
velocity
and
the
first
one
is
the
direction,
second
one
is
dv
x,
right
and
this
is
the
direction,
dr,
sorry
dr.
So,
dv
x
dr
is
the
tau
r
x.
So
if
we
substitute
in
place
of
tau
r
x,
if
we
substitute
this,
minus
mu
dv
x
dr
then
we
can
write
mu
dv
x
dr
is
equal
to
this
minus
we have taken to  this side.
So
minus
delta
P
by
L
into
r
by
2
right.
So
we
get
by
rearranging,
dv
x
dr
is
equal
to
minus
delta
P
by
2
mu
L
into
r
right.
So
on
integration
of
this,
we
get
v
x
is
equal
to
minus
delta
p
by
2
mu
L.
Now
this
r
becomes
r
square
and
divided
by
2
plus
an
integration
constant
called
C
1,
other
was
C
and
this
one
is
C
1,
right.
So,
we
need
another boundary to find out this integration constant C 1, we need another boundary .
Now, at r = R,Vx= 0
∴
C1
= (
∆
p/4
μ
L) R2
Vx
= (
∆
p/4
μ
L) (R2-r2)
So,
what
could
be
the
boundary
our
pipe
was
like
this,
right
and
fluid
was
flowing
like
this,
right,
and
it
is
laminar ,
etc.
all
things
were
said.
So,
the
velocity
here,
it
is
v
x.
So
in
the
direction
of
x,
velocity
is
v
x.
So
this
velocity
which
is
in
the
pipe
wall,
so
that
is
not
moving because it is clinging to the surface, right, this is called clinging  to the surface.
So,
the
fluid
which
is
clinging
to
the
surface
is
not
moving
and
therefore,
the
velocity
at
r
is
equal
to
say,
capital
R
is
equal
to
0,
sorry ,
v
x
is
0
at
r
is
equal
to
capital
R,
v
x
is
0
right.
So,
that
is
what
we
have
taken
and
by
solving
we
get
the
value
of
C
1
equal
to
delta
P
by
4
mu
L
into
R
square,
right.
So,
delta
P
by
4
mu
L
into
R
square,
we
get
and
substituting
the
value
of
C
1
to
the
value
of
v
x,
if
we
substitute,
then
we
get
v
x
is
equal
to
delta
P
by
4
mu
L
into
R
square,
capital
R
square
minus
small
r
square
right.
Here
again
we
have
taken
that
volume
element
small,
here,
and
the
radius
we
have
taken
to
be
equal to r right this is r and if it is the axis  right.So,
we
have
gotten
the
velocity
in
this,
is
called
instantaneous
velocity
at
any
position
because x we have not said, x can be anything, like x can be anything, like here.
So
that
is
v
x
1
or
here
that
is
v
x
2
or
here
v
x
3,
right.
We
have
not
said.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
called
instantaneous
velocity
and
the
velocity
is
then
determined
as
the
maximum
velocity
or
average
velocity .
So
that
instantaneous
velocity
v
x
we
have
gotten
delta
P
by
4
mu
L
into
R
square
minus
r
square
capital
R
square
minus
small
r
square,
right.
Since,
we have gotten it, we can find out the average velocity .
The
velocity
which
normally
we
talk
about
is
the
average
velocity ,
that
is,
you
have
this
pipe
here
you
have
one
velocity
as
we
said
v
x
1
here
we
have
another
velocity
v
x
2
here
we
have
another
velocity
v
x
3
dot
dot
dot
as
many
points
we
get
right.
So
we
can
say
that
the
average
velocity
is
the
velocity
which
we
talk
about.
So
how
can,
we
find
out
average
velocity .
So
v
average
is
1
by
A
area
into
integration
of
the
area,
right.
So,
that is 0 to 2 pi and the other one that  is 0 to L, that is the x, right.
So
if
this
two
we
take
then
it
is
v
x
into
d
A.
Now
this
d
A
is
nothing
but
r
d
theta
and
d
v
x,
right,
r
d
theta
d
r
into
v
x.
So,
this
we
substitute
as
1
by
r
1
by
A
integral
of,
double
integration
of
v
x
d
A
and
this
v
x
d
A,
we
are
substituting
as
v
x
1
by
pi
R
square
right
and
v
x
into
r
d
theta,
r
d
theta
is
that
area
right,
that
this
is
r
d
theta
is
that
angle
between
this
and
this.
So
this
is
the
d
theta.
So
r
d
theta
into
d
r
right
into
v
x
is
the
expression.
Now ,
on
simplification,
on
integration,
we
can
write
that
delta
P
is
P
in
minus
P
out
obviously ,
that
delta
P
this
P
1
is
much
more
than
p
P
right,
that
is
P
in
is
higher
than
p
out
right.
So
that
we
can
take
as
P
in
minus
P
out
over
4
mu
L
times
R
square
into
1
minus
small
y
capital
R
whole
square
right.
This
we
are
getting
and
we
get
that
this
v
average
that
becomes
equal
to
P
in
minus
P
out
into
capital
D
square
by
32
mu
L
right.
This
is
known
as
Hagen-Poiseuille
equation.
Most
of
the
cases,
you
are
asked,
how
can
you find out  the pressure drop in a pipe.
Vav
= 1/A.
∫∫
vx
dA = 1/
π
 
R2.
∫∫
 vx
r d
ө
 
dr
= 1/
π
 
R2
∫
 2
π
r dr vx
= (2
π
/
π
R2
) 
∫
 r (
∆
p/4
μ
L)(R2-r2) dr
= (P0-PL
)/2
μ
L (R2/2 - R2/4)
= (P0-PL
)/8
μ
L R2= (P0-PL
)/32
μ
L D2
So
that
you
can
say
through
the
Hagen-Poiseuille's
equation.
If
you
know
pressure
drop,
or
if
you
do
not
know
pressure
drop
then,
if
you
know
average
velocity ,
if
you
know
the
viscosity ,
length,
and
diameter ,
then
you
can
find
out
what
is
the
pressure
drop
in
the
pipe,
right.
This
is
called
theoretical
and
from
there
we
get
v
max,
which
is
how
much
v
is
max
at,
this
was
the
pipe,
v
is
max
at
r
is
equal
to
0.
So
that
r
is
equal
to
0
v
is
equal
to
v
max
right.
So
by
substituting
that
we
get
P
in
minus
P
out
into
R
square
by
4
mu
L
this
is the v max and from the relation we get v average  is equal to v max by 2.

∴Vav= Vmax/2
v

equal
to
v
max
by
2
ok.
Hope
you
have
understood
how
the
pressure,
how
the
pressure
drop
in
the
pipe
can
be
calculated
with
the
help
of
Hagen-Poiseuille's
equation
ok. Thank you.
