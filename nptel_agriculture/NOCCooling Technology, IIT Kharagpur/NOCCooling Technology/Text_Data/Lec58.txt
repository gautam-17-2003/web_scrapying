Cold
Storage
Good
afternoon
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
friends.
In
this
course
we
are
on
the
ver ge
of
completion
of
the
course,
we
have
3
more
lectures
left,
and
as
I
said
earlier
that,
my
last
lectures
will
be
on
ice
cream,
but
as
you
know
that,
ice
cream
is
a
very
cold
product
and
definitely
cold
is
associated
with
that.
So,
our
purpose
of
the
course
will
also
be
justified.
Now ,
we
were
in
the
previous
class
with
cold
chain
and
cold
storage,
right,
and
let
us
complete
the
cold
storage
today
and
to
do
that.
I
had
shown
you
condenser
and
also
said
that
what
exactly
is
happening
in
the
cold
storages
right.
I
had
shown
you
exactly
one,
from
one
of
the
cold
storages,
but
I
have
visited
tens
of
cold
storages,
but
I
did
not
find
any ,
anything,
which
is
beyond,
what
I
said
right.
Because,
most
of
the
cold
storages
are
very
very
old,
and
not
only
old,
they
are
designed,
on
the
basis
of
thumb
rule,
no
detailed
calculations
are
made.
Fortunately ,
we
had
done
lot
of
calculations
with
the
help
of
CFD
computational
fluid
dynamics,
so,
there
we
have
shown
also
what
are
the
real
problems
associated,
and
with
that
let
me
show
you
that,
in
this
cold
storage,
in
this
cold
storage,
yeah,
this
I
have,
I
will
come
back
again,
but
what
exactly
this
heat
of
respiration?
Earlier
also,
I
have
shown
and
told
you
during
our
load
calculations,
how
the
heat
of
respirations
are
calculated
right.
Some
of
the
heat
of
respirations
at
dif ferent
temperatures
are
given
here.
Now
this
I
would
like
to
discuss
in
detail
that,
why
the
situation
of
the
cold
stores
is
like
that.
From
here,
what
we
observe
that,
while
we
are
considering
refrigeration
load,
that
depends
on
primarily
heat
of
respiration,
that
is
one
part,
second
part,
heat
in
leak
through
the
insulation,
and
third
part
is
the
handling
by
the
compressor .
So,
these
three
parts
if
we
look
at
separately
then
heat
of
respiration
that
depends
on
the
quantity
of
if
it
is
potato
as
one
of
the
storage
material,
its
maturity
whether
it
is
early
or
matured
that
depend
that
will
depend
the
heat
of
respiration.
So,
some
question
rather
the
quality
of
the
potato
that
is
also
important
right.
Then
heat
in
leak
through
the
insulation
that
depends
on
insulation
quantity
and
quality
right.
So,
insulation
technique
is
also
important
how
it
is
being
insulated
I
said
one
of
the
other
day
that
if
a
pipe
you
have
to
insulate
with
a
6
inch.
So,
this
is
6
inch
insulation
and
this
is
the
pipe
right.
So,
if
you
have
to
do
6
inch
insulation
what
you
will
do
what
is
your
reply
will
you
buyone
and
if
it
is
a
cylindrical
one
definitely
that
also
will
be
a
cylindrical
one.
So,
are
you
going
to
buy
a
6
half
of
it.
So,
6
inch
half
this
side
6
inch
half
that
side
are
you
going
to
buy
an
insulating?
If
the
answer
is
yes
then
it
is
no
you
should
not
because
yes
if
you
buy
in
one
shot
6
inch
insulation
then
your
cost
will
be
less,
but
you
see
your
pipe
is
this
and
your
insulation
whatever
be
the
insulating
material
whether
it
is
polyurethane
foam
of
course,
polyurethane
foam
is
not
insulated
like
that
mostly
it
is
insulated
in
situ
and
it
can
be
thermo
cold
right.
So,
if
it
is
thermo
cold
then
if
you
buy
a
6
inch
like
this
then
there
is
can
be
some
cases
where
your
insulation
is
almost
thorough.
That
means,
the
density
depending
on
the
density
how
much
compact
it
is
air
can
be
going
in
and
out
easily .
So,
to
avoid
that
it
is
advisable
that
such
a
pipe
you
insulate
with
number
of
say
2
inch
then
another
2
inch
then
another
2
inch.
So,
that
this
6
inch
there
will
be
lot
of
resistances.
That
is
how
here
we
said
that
insulation
technique
how
it
is
being
insulated.
If
we
talk
about
insulation
quality
then
what
is
the
type
of
insulation
you
are
using
and
then
it
is
degradation
by
vapour
permeation
whether
it
is
degradable
or
not
that
also
has
to
be
looked
into,
but
as
I
said
in
most
of
the
cases
things
are
not
like
that.
If
it
is
from
the
handling
of
the
compressor
then
for
the
compressor
nature
of
cooling
what
how
you
are
cooling
the
compressor
then
how
it
is
associated
with
the
condenser
and
also
with
evaporator
and
what
are
the
compressor
types
you
are
using.
Now ,
nature
of
cooling
it
could
be
again
by
convection
by
either
natural
convection
or
forced
convection.
So,
this
are
you
have
the
possibilities
you
have
to
of
course,
select
the
best
then
over
when
you
are
talking
about
condenser
whether
it
is
air
cooled
condenser
or
water
cooled
condenser .
If
it
is
water
cooled
condenser
whether
it
is
a
bare
tube
or
fin
tube
and
the
other
type
of
condenser
could
be
it
is
evaporative
type
of
condenser .
Again
you
have
to
select
the
best
for
evaporator
again
whether
it
is
a
bare
tube
evaporator
or
a
fin
tube
evaporator .
If
it
is
for
the
compressor
then
whether
it
is
ammonia
or
Freon
obviously ,
depending
on
ammonia
or
Freon
it
will
be
quite
dif ferent.
So,
you
have
to
select
out
of
these
the
best
one
best
combination
you
have
to
find
out
that
is
technical.
Now
what
actually
happens
is
that
the
this
is
the
actual
vis-a-vis
the
owner
of
the
store.
So,
owner
thinks
that
more
capacity
of
the
cold
material
must
be
kept.
Y es
that
is
giving
him
a
positive
gain
because
more
money
can
earn
from
the
storage
and
as
the
rent
for
the
material
right.
So,
this
could
be
a
plus
for
the
owner
right.
So,
for
that
what
he
needs
to
do
he
has
to
store
it
with
more
compactness
right
very
tightly
like
one
here
next
one
is
adjacent
to
and
one
above
it
one
below
it
like
that
more
compact
he
has
to
do.
Then
if
it
is
done
that
more
compactness
as
he
will
get
positive
result
out
of
that
the
more
rent
he
can
gain,
but
what
he
has
to
for go
for
that.
This
willlead
to
higher
temperature
at
the
centre
and
this
higher
temperature
at
the
centre
means
more
rotting
at
the
centre
this
is
a
negative
rotting
means
you
have
to
throw
out.
So,
this
is
negative
which
they
do
not
consider
or
it
can
be
low
temperature
at
the
surface.
I
will
just
show
you
again
that
how
it
is
compact
and
how
the
evaporator
coils
are
there.
So,
he
has
to
bring
down
the
temperature
to
make
it
more
compact.
So,
that
assuming
he
will
supply
properly
the
cold
air
for
that
temperature
has
to
be
lowered
and
the
moment
he
does
it
is
low
temperature
at
the
surface
resulting
to
more
cold
injury
at
the
surface.
So,
that
is
also
negative
for
the
owner .
Now ,
the
moment
the
temperature
is
lowered
how
it
can
be
done
by
lowering
temperature
of
the
evaporator .
So,
when
he
is
doing
lowering
of
the
temperature
of
the
evaporator
this
will
lead
to
more
moisture
on
the
evaporator
because
the
more
dif ference
of
temperature
moisture
will
migrate
from
the
potato
to
the
evaporator .
So,
this
will
lead
to
more
frost
on
the
evaporator
which
is
also
a
negative
part
because
the
moment
frosting
is
there
other ,
day
I
said
that,
that
will
act
as
insulation.
So,
this
is
not
absolutely
desirable.
Then
this
lowering
of
temperature
in
the
evaporator
means
more
compressor
work
is
required
because
we
have
seen
that
if
you
lower
down
the
evaporator
temperature
then
compressor
power
requirement
is
more.
So,
more
work
for
the
compressor
again
more
ener gy
consumption
which
is
also
negative
right.
So,
that
means,
you
see,
for
a
gain
of
some
rent
from
the
material,
so
many
negative
things
he
has
to
under go,
which
he
is
just
for getting
or
overlooking
whereas,
if
he
does
the
reverse,
that
less
quantity
of
material
for
stacking
with
air
flow
space
in
between
bags
if
he
has
that.
So,
it
will
af fect
less
compact
of
the
cold
room.
So,
less
quantity
of
material
so
less
rent
obtained
so
it
is
a
negative
on
the
owner
side,
but
what
will
be
positive?
So,
this
will
not
result
to
high
temperature
at
the
centre.
So,
not
too
high
temperature,
or
it
is
reasonable
a
temperature
at
the
centre.
So,
this
will
minimize
the
rotting.
So,
that
is
a
positive
he
does
not
have
to
throw
out
to
the
material.
So,
that
is
positive.
So,
that
means,
he
does
not
have
to
low
temperature
at
the
surface
or
surface
temperature
will
not
be
low
on
the
top.
So,
that
will
result
to
less
cold
injury
which
is
also
positive
he
does
not
have
to
throw
that
cold
injured
product
out
because
neither
the
person
who
kept
it
nor
the
consumer
will
accept
it
right.
So,
he
has
to
throw .
So,
this
means
that
higher
temperature
of
the
evaporator
the
moment
temperature
is
higher
we
have
seen
earlier
compressor
has
to
work
low .
So,
less
compressor
work
so
which
is
also
positive
power
consumption
is
less.
So,
less
ener gy
consumption
that
is
also
positive
and
the
higher
the
temperature
of
the
evaporator
less
is
the
moisture
migration
because
temperature
dif ference
will
be
less
moisturemigration
also
will
be
less
deposition
of
the
moisture
on
the
on
the
evaporator
will
be
less.
So,
there
will
be
less
frosting.
So,
the
heat
transfer
will
be
better .
So,
less
frost
on
the
evaporator
so
that
is
also
positive.
So,
with
all
these
negative
and
positive
part
putting
together
what
gain
one
cold
room
owner
cold
storage
owner
is
gaining
he
is
if
he
is
keeping
more
quantity
of
material
thereby
he
is
earning
more
rent,
but
further
he
has
to
have
all
negatives
right.
And
if
he
does
keep
reasonable
quantity ,
a
little
less
than
compact,
then
his
earning
will
be
less
in
rent,
but
all
others
will
be
positive
no
loss
due
to
frosting
no
loss
due
to
cold
injury
no
loss
due
to
again
rotting
everything
is
not
there
and
power
consumption
in
the
compressor
is
also
not
the
high
as
well
the
evaporator
will
have
no
such
frosting
by
which
the
heat
transfer
will
be
minimized
right.
This
is
the
real
picture
reality ,
but
nobody
listens
to
it.
So,
if
we
go
back
as
we
were
starting
with
we
have
shown
with
the
condenser
now
we
show
the
evaporator .
So,
this
is
the
evaporator
coil
ok.
This
is
one,
which
is
just
after
running
the
compressors.
These
are
the
holder
of
the
refrigerant,
from
where
it
is
getting
distributed.
These
are
the
pipelines
as
you
see
some
frosting
has
started
right
because
these
people
they
do
not
believe
if
there
is
no
frosting
that
means,
the
system
is
not
working,
that
is
what
they
feel
not
only
they
feel
it
has
been
told
that
you
see
that,
there
is
frosting,
then
only
you
can
confirm
that
your
system
is
working.
They
never
go
and
check,
there
is
a
ghory
(dial),
that
what
they
call
that,
there
is
a
dial,
that
dial
they
will
never
see
that,
what
is
the
pressure,
what
is
the
temperature.
So,
these
things
are
not
taken
care
of.
So,
this
is
one
which
has
just
started
the
frosting.
Now ,
next
if
you
look
at
you
will
be
surprised
if
you
look
at
the
next
you
will
be
surprised.
W e
said
now ,
just
now ,
that
the
more
quantity
they
can
put
more
is
the
rent.
So,
more
is
the
profit
it
is
not
at
all
because
at
the
centre
of
this
at
the
centre
of
this,
this
is,
there
are,
as
you
know
there
are
6
feet

6
feet
by
6
feet
cubicles
right
and
as
you
know ,
I
will
show
some
that
the
floor
is
like
that.
So,
there
is
some
gap
by
through
which
the
air
can
go
in
and
come
down
it
is
all
in
all
floors
except
the
top
and
bottom,
bottom
means
ground.
So,
they
do
load
it
in
such
a
compact
way
that
there
is
no
chance
of
flow
of
air
inside.
So,
the
one
which
we
said
rotting
will
be
there
and
this
is
true.
It
has
been
seen
that
many
bags
they
are
rotten
simply
rotten
right.
Rotten
means,
burnt
out
black
along
with
the
material,
because,
this
heat
of
respiration
is
also
high,
and
if
they
are
not
eliminated
and
that
too
there
will
be
carbon
dioxide
production
inside,
because,
it
will
not
be
going
out,
it
is
respiration,
the
same
respiration
you
are
having.
So,
more
compact
is
injurious
right.Then
another
one,
which
you
can
show
is
this.
I
said
that
there
are
fans,
which
are
axial
fans,
like
at
your
home,
and
imagine
that
this
is
on
the
top
floor ,
54
feet
height
of
the
cold
room,
54
feet
height
of
the
cold
room
at
the
top
it
is
there.
So,
we
can
reduce
5
feet.
So,
around
say
50
feet
roughly ,
the
air
has
to
travel.
For
that
what
are
the
resistances?
First
resistance
is
that,
these
are
all
evaporator
coils,
I
said
that
evaporator
coils
are
roughly
around
30
to
35
kilometer
in
length,
for
evaporator
and
condenser .
So,
around
30
to
35
such
kilometer
coils
are
there,
and
here
you
see
the
previous
one,
I
showed,
which
was
just
starting
the
frosting,
and
here
it
is,
a
thick
ice
is
there.
So,
that
means,
if
the
refrigerant
inside
is
at
minus
2
degree
say ,
then
because
this
is
ice,
it
is
not
getting
minus
2,
the
rest
is
only
getting
0
degree,
right.
So,
ice
is
acting
as
the
resistance
for
flow
of
heat,
and
where
from
this
ice
is
coming?
This
ice
is
coming
from
the
packets,
which
I
had
shown
you,
from
the
packets
which
I
had
shown
you
just
now .
So,
these
packets’
moisture
will
come
out
from
them
right
and
will
accumulate
into
the
evaporator
coil.
This
we
have
discussed
beforehand,
right.
So,
this
is
the
actual
condition,
and
nobody
looks
at,
nobody
in
anywhere
of
India
takes
care
of
this,
unless
and
at
least,
not
less
than
25
to
30
interactions
with
the
farmers,
and
the
cold
store
owners,
tried
to
convince,
but
they
understand,
but
the
moment
they
leave
the
place,
for get
everything.
So,
it
is
exactly
happening
like
that
which
is
absolutely
not
desirable.
So,
the
desirable
one
is
one,
which
just
we
showed
that,
you
should
have,
you
should
have,
I
am
not
going
back
to
this,
you
should
have,
this
action
should
be
followed,
that
less
quantity
put,
you
have
all
positive,
except
the
rent
is
less,
except
that
you
have
everything
positive,
and
you
have
really
a
positive
gain,
your
profit
will
be
much
more,
because,
nowadays,
that
ener gy
is
becoming
day
by
day
increasingly
high,
and
the
power
consumption,
if
it
is
more,
then
the
electric
bill
will
be
very
very
high.
It
is
several
lakhs
they
do
pay ,
because
of
miss
handling.
So,
my
request
to
my
students
that,
if
you
really
come
across
with
the
cold
store
people,
try
to
make
them
understand,
only
this
page
is
good
enough,
for
rectification
of
the
cold
store.
I
have
shown
you
the
reality
in
terms
of
condenser ,
in
terms
of
compressor ,
in
terms
of
evaporator
coils,
but
and
also
the
fans,
but,
I
could
not
show
you
the
expansion
device,
right
because,
those
are
very
very
close
to
the
evaporator .
So,
could
not
find,
it
is,
and
please
convey
that
it
is
a
loss
for
them.
So,
with
this,
I
complete
the
cold
store
part,
and
next
we
will
go
for
the
last
two
classes,
in
both
manufacturing
ice
cream,
and
preserving
or
storing
it
and
transporting
it.
So,
thank
you
all
for
carefully
listening.
Thank
you.
