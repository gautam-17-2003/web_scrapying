How to pr oduce Safe Foods
Good
morning
again.
In
the
previous
class
we
completed
with
the
different
definitions
perishable,
nonperishable,
self
stable
etc.
After
defining,
we
come
to
this
point
that
how
to
produce
safe
foods,
right.
Because,
as
we
are
saying
that,
safe
food
is
the
slogan
of
today
or
is
the
word
of
today ,
where
everybody
is
looking
for
or
running
after
safe
foods.
So,
to
do
that
let
us
come
to
this
point
that
there
are
many
ways
by
which
safe
foods
can
be
prepared.
Mainly
by
thermal
processing,
thermal
processing
meaning
that
we
are
lowering
down
the
water
activity
by
either
drying
or
freezing
and
also
we
can
do
the
same
by
adding
sodium
chloride
or
some
molecules
for
example,
as
we
said
sodium
chloride.
So,
this
is
one
way
of
producing
safe
foods.
Some
others
are
also
there
like
high
pressure.
High
pressure
processing
is
a
new
type
of
technique
which
has
come
up,
but
obviously
is
very
highly
costly ,
right,
because
you
are
not
creating
high
pressure
through
gases.  So, there to create high pressure, lot of equipment, instruments are there.
Then,
some
ultraviolet
light,
yes,
ultraviolet
light,
but
that
also
has
limitation
of
the
range
of
ultraviolet
treatment.
May
be
a
ozone
treatment,
we
know
all
that
ozone
is
such
a
thing
which
helps
in
oxidation,
but
in
many
cases
it
is
also
helpful
to
create
the
food
safe.
Using
some
electrical
pulses,
electrical
pulses
in
the
sense
we
create
this
type
of
pulses,
right.
We
create
this
type
of
pulses
in
the
electric
field,
of
course,
it
needs
very
very
high
voltage
and
that
is
the
reason
this
electrical
pulses
or
high
pressure
processing
or
many
others
which
are
of
today's
nature
they
are
not
commercially
used.
So,
it
will
take time because as of today the price of these processed foods are very very  high.
So,
we
are
not
able
to
produce
them.
Now ,
incorporation
of
additives
which
we
have
done,
I
had
given
you
some
example
earlier ,
that
you
are
making,
you
are
making
sauerkraut
or
some
food
materials
which
are
handled
by
application
of
some
salts,
right.
So,
incorporation
of
additives,
they
are
like
that,
right.
So,
these
are
how
you
are
able
to
produce
some
safe
foods.
Now ,
another
way
is
that
refrigeration
and
freezing
as
amethod
of
preservation
that
most
pathogen
growth
is
stopped
at
or
below
minus
5
degree
centigrade.
Now
again
in
this
regard
since
pathogen
has
come
out
and
the
temperature
has
come
up
let
me
also
inform
you
that
there
are
three
types
of
bacteria
one
is
called
thermophilic
another
is
called
mesophilic
and
third
one
is
called
psychrophilic.
Philic
means
loving.
Now ,
thermophilic
means
that
high
temperatures
loving,
high
temperature
loving
organisms.
So,
they
do
act
around
40,
50,
55
degree
centigrade.
So,
they
are
thermophilic,
some
we
said
as
mesophilic
meaning
that
they
do
act
around
plus
20
to
plus 30 degree centigrade moderate temperature.
Psychrophilic
are
those
which
act
around
minus
plus
5
degree
centigrade
plus
minus
5
degree
centigrade.
That
means,
if
the
temperature
is
around
40,
45,
60
degree
centigrade
then
thermophiles
will
be
active
and
all
the
organisms
which
are
thermophiles
or
depending
on
many
other
factors
like
that,
what
is
the
what
is
the
food
material
for
them
etc.
may
definitely
detect
that
the
thermophile
action.
Then
this
mesophilic,
where
the
temperature
range
is
between
20
to
30
degree
centigrade
and
more
in
many
cases,
this
is
the
room
temperature
of
most
of
the
places
during
most
of
the
time
of
the
year
except
some
period.
So,
there
the
mesophiles
do
grow
around
20
to
30,
but
thermophiles
do
not,
right,
like
when
is
40
to
45
or
50
or
60
degree
centigrade
that
time
mesophiles
or
psychrophiles
do
not
act,
when
the
temperature
is
25
plus
minus
degree,
then
thermophiles and psychrophiles  do not act.
And
the
third
one
is
plus
5
degree
centigrade
where
psychrophiles,
sorry ,
mesophiles
and
thermophiles
are
not
acting,
but
the
thing
is
that
in
none
of
the
cases
the
lowering
of
temperature
does
not
kill
the
organism.
If
you
want
to
kill
the
organism
you
have
to
heat
them,
no
other
way,
heat
them
or
like
that
that
high
pressure
processing,
there
it
is
though
costly
very
costly ,
but
by
that
technique
you
can
also
do
the
extension
of
the
storage
life.
Then,
it
comes
that
the
few
pathogens
grow
slowly
under
refrigeration
conditions
also
and
this
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
follows
down
spoilage
microor ganism
mechanism,
growth,
and
it
follows
chemical
reactions
that
can
happen
to
make
off
flavors,
at
what
temperature
do
freeze
or
food
freeze.
Now ,
normally
we
know
that
food
freezes
around
0
degree
centigrade,
but
most
of
the
food
materials,
being
having
some
soluble
particles,
the
freezing
point
is
depressed,
freezing
point
depression
takes
place,
right,
and
it
is
lower
than
0
degree
centigrade,
but
foods
are
not
pure
water .
So,
they
freeze
at
less
than
0
degree
centigrade,
for
example,
meats
do
not
start
to
freeze
until
they are less than about minus 2.
2
degree
centigrade
and
hard
frozen
until
closer
to
minus
18
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
the
moment
it
comes
to
minus
18,
the
word
I
would
like
to
put
before
you
why
minus
18,why
not
minus
20
or
minus
10
or
minus
5,
15,
some
good
number ,
not
such
an
odd
number
of
18,
any
idea
any
explanation
from
your
side
take
a
minute,
I
have
no
problem,
but
the
history
says
that
during
old
age,
very
very
earlier
not
earlier
centuries,
earlier
many
many
centuries,
people
used
to
travel
from
one
place
to
other
place
with
the
help
of
either
camel
or
sheep
or
maybe
horse
and
they
had
to
carry
lot
of
food
materials
with
them.
Now ,
since
they
are
carrying,
maybe
some
food
material
or
milk
in
some
containers,
like
where
it
can
be
maintained
at
0
degree
centigrade
or
rather
0
degree
Fahrenheit
or
it
has
been
found
that
the
products
which
they
were
carrying
was
very
good
at
the
temperature
of
0
Fahrenheit.
So,
since
the
product
was
very
good
at
0
Fahrenheit
they
considered
that
this
is
the
best
possible
way
of
making
it
at
minus
18
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
0
Fahrenheit,
if
you
convert
to
centigrade,
then
you
will
see
it
is
almost minus 17 point some number ,  some degree centigrade, maybe 17.
6
or
5
like
that.
So,
minus
17.7
or
5
is
rounded
off
to
minus
18
and
that
is
why
minus
18
has
come
up,
right.
So,
and
this
is
everywhere
that
the
old
history
of
0
Fahrenheit,
that
time
there
were
no
centigrade
scale
and
this
is
why
people
do
say
that
minus
18
or
below
is
the
base
temperature
of
storage,
whether
frozen
food
normally
frozen
food
because
minus
18
normally
no
foods
are
bare.
Now ,
at
temperatures
less
than
0
degree
centigrade
no or ganisms can grow .
So,
no
pathogen
can
grow ,
no
spoilage
organisms
can
grow ,
it
is
the
freezer
that
gets
colder
that
is
even
less
than
minus
18
degree
centigrade,
chemical
reactions
are
even
that
minus
18,
chemical
reactions
are
inhibited
even
more
ok.
Eventually
chemical
reactions
will
deteriorate
the
food
material
because
ultimately
it
is
the
chemical
reactions
which
control
the
quality
of
the
food
material.
Now ,
this
chemical
reaction
could
be
pure
chemical
reactions,
like
sodium
hydroxide
plus
HCl
sodium
chloride
plus
other
materials.
Similarly ,
chemical
reactions
like
biochemical
path
for
example,
we
are
taking
everyday
pickled
food
materials,
pickling
is
also
a
part
of
this
chemical
controlled
mechanism
and
we
then
try
to
keep
it
in
the
refrigerator ,
but
most
of
us
know
that
it
is
no
longer
required
to
keep
under
refrigerated
conditions
because
it
has
sufficient
quantity
of
salt.
Now
what
we
were
referring
to
was
that
at
minus
18
degree
centigrade
or
below
if
the
food
materials
are
kept
then
they
are
stored
for
a
longer
period,
but
if
you
lower
down
the
food
temperature,
what
I
was
saying
is
that,
eventually
chemical
reactions,
they will dictate the quality of the food material.
So,
it
is
not
all,
of
course,
it
is
not
the
microor ganisms
which
will
dictate
alone,
it
is
also
the
chemical
reactions
or
biochemical
reactions
that
will
also
dictate
the
quality
of
the
food
materials,
but
here
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
lowering
the
temperature
up
to
minus
18
degree
centigrade
or
0
Fahrenheit
does
not
mean
that
you
can
kill
the
organism.
So,
killing
is
not
possible
by
lowering
the
temperature
even
to
minus
18degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
it
becomes
no
more
that
if
somebody
is
believing
that
freezing
can
kill
any
organism
but
he
is
away
from
the
truth.
The
truth
is
that
freezing
is
not
a
method
of
killing
bacteria.
So,
killing
bacteria
is
always
required
to
have
thermal
processing,
high
temperature
processing
which
in
other
words
is
not
possible
in
any
other thing.
Maybe
as
I
said
earlier
some
other
different
processes
like
electrical
technology
or
high
pressure
processing
etc.
They
are
yet
to
come
up
to
the
commercial
level,
but
someday
it
may
come
up,
we
have
no
idea,
but
what
I
was
highlighting
on
that,
the
freezing
is
not
method
to
kill
organisms
or
microor ganisms,
right.
So,
some
of
the
preservation
techniques,
what
we
have
already
come
up
to
us,
is
that,
application
of
heat
during
cooking
frying
bottling
or
boiling
or
simply
heating
prior
to
consumption,
commercial
processes,
are
used
for
example,
blanching,
pasteurization,
sterilization,
dehydration
etc.
Now ,
out
of
this
blanching
is
one
of
the
very
very
important
one,
all
are
important,
blanching
is
done
prior
to
mostly
freezing.
In
non
freezing
also,
blanching
can
be
done
because
blanching,
what
it
is
doing,
it
is
heating
around
70
to
95
degree
centigrade,
or
75
to
95
degree
centigrade
for
1
to
10
minute
depending
on
the
food
material
and
its
enzymatic load.
So,
enzymes
are
deactivated
mostly
in
blanching
and
that
is
why,
nowadays,
you
get
pea
round
the
clock
or
throughout
the
year
though
Pea
is
a
very
very
sophisticated
and
weather
dependent
material.
So,
there
the
color
of
the
Pea
is
maintained
typically ,
if
it
is
blanched
around
75
to
95
degree
1
to
10
minute,
that
depends
on
what
kind
of
material
you
are
taking.
So,
it
restricts
undesirable
changes
in
odor,
color ,
flavor ,
texture
and
nutritive
values
of
storage
by
freezing
and
removes
intracellular
gases,
minimizes
potential
for
oxidative
changes
and
that
reduces
microbial
food
that
may
be
toxic
by
microbial
food
leaching
rather
and
is
toxic
and
constituents
of
such
products
like
it
containing
nitrates
in
France
and
removes
pesticides,
right.
So,
I
think
today's
time
is
over.
So,
in
the
next
class
we
shall
go
through
how
the
taste
of
the
organism
through
microbes or through this as we said pasteurization  is done, right. Thank you.
