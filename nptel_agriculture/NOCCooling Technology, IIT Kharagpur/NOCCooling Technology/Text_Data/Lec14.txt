Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
So,
good
afternoon.If
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
class,
we
have
also
introduced
another
thermodynamic
property ,
called
entropy .
Because,
and
this
is
that,
in
the
class,
a
lecture
of
14,
basics
of
thermodynamics
is
continuing
right.
Now ,
after
defining
entropy ,
let
us
consider
Carnot
heat
engine
as
an
example.
Because,
we
said
that
we
have
come
to
one
new
thermodynamic
property ,
that
is
entropy .
Now ,
when
entropy
is
to
be
established,
or
is
to
be
understood
properly ,
then
it
is
better
to
go
for
Carnot
heat
engine,
right.
And
in
Carnot
heat
engine,
all
the
processes
are
reversible.
Earlier ,
we
said
about
this,
a
cyclic
process
unless,
it
is
a
reversible
process,
cannot
come
back
to
its
original,
right,
where
from
you
started
with.
So,
here
also,
we
are
starting
with
the
point
say
1,
then
we
are going to the point, all  these are state points, mind it.  All these are state points.
So,
it
is
going
to
state
point
2,
then
it
is
going
to
state
point
3,
then
it
is
going
to
state
point
4,
and
again
coming
back
to
state
point
1,
right.
And,
this
is
only
possible
if
we
are
considering
all
the
processes
under
reversible
condition.
You
see,
here
we
have
shown
the
reversibility
sign,
here
we
have
shown
the
reversibility
sign,
here
also
we
have
shown
the
reversibility
sign.
So,
reversible
heat
engine,
unless
it
is
there,
unless,
the
heat
engine
is
reversible,
rather
then,
this
is
not
possible
to
come
back
to
state
point
1,
from
state
point
2
to
3
to
4
and
back
to
1,
right.
So,
in
all
these
processes
in
heat
engine,
we
say
the
processes
which
are
involved
in
the
heat
engine,
through
Carnot
cycle
is
that
these
are
the
4
reversible
processes
in
which
process
1
to
2
is
isentropic
compression
here.
The
one,
which
we
are
showing,
the
graph
is
PV,
right,
this
is
P
and
this
is
V.
So,
PV
diagram,
we
are
showing.
So,
all
the
processes
are
reversible
process
1
-
2
is
isentropic
compression
right.
Isentropic
means
that
entropy
is
constant
right.
Isentropic
compression.The
process
2
to
3
is
isothermal
heat
addition,
that
is
Q
-
H
quantity
of
heat
is
added
and
work
is
obtained
as
output
and
process
3
to
4
is
isentropic
expansion
and
process
4
to
1
is
isothermal
heat
rejection,
where
QC
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
and
work
is
obtained
as
input
right.
So,
this
is
what
explicitly
is
the
Carnot
engine
sorry ,
this
is
what
is
the
explicitly
Carnot
engine,
heat
engine,
rather ,
where
there
are
4
reversible
steps
1
to
2,
2
to
3,
3
to
4,
4
to
back
to
1,
and
all
the
processes
are
reversible,
as
it
is
shown
through,
the
another
figure,
that
is,
that
is,
this,
where
all
the
processes
are
reversible,
right
here,
here,
here,
these
are
all
reversible
processes
and
we
are
following
the
heat
engine
through
Carnot
cycle,
and
in
this
cycle
there
are
4
reversible
processes.
Process
1
to
2
is
isentropic
compression
process
2
to
3
is
isothermal
heat
addition
to
the
heat
quantity
of
QC
and
work
output
is
obtained
because,
you
are
adding
heat,
work
is
obtained
as
output,
and
process
3
to
4
is
isentropic
expansion
and
process
4
to
1
is
isothermal
heat
rejection,
QC,
where
work
is
to
be
done
on
the
system,
or
work
in,
as
input
right.
So,
then
if
we
analyze
and
if
we
assume
that
the
system
to
have
a
perfect
gas,
then
if
perfect
gas
is
acting
as
a
working
fluid
along
the
isothermal
process
that
is
2
to
3
along
the
isothermal
process
that
is
process
2
to
3
here,
also,
I
am
drawing
may
not
be
exactly
that,
these are the 4.  So, this is 1, this was 2, this was 3 and this was 4, this will keep.
So,
that
we
do
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
figue
every
now
and
then.
so
in
the
isothermal
process,
2
to
3
that
isothermal
was
this
one,
right
process
2
to
3
and
process
4
back
to
1,
the
temperature
is
constant,
as
a
result
the
internal
energy
remains
also
constant
right.
We
have
seen
earlier
that
we
had
given
10
kg
kilo
joules
of
heat
and
we
saw
that
the
internal
energy
went
up,
because
of
that
the
molecules
were
moving,
remember
right.
So,
if
the
temperature
is
constant
that
means,
the
internal
energy
is
also
constant.
So,
from
the
first
law
we
can
write
that
Q
2
to
3
is
equal
to
W
2
to
3,
because
U
2
to
3,
that
is
this
one, is 0 right.
From the first law, we can write
Q2-3= W2-3since   U2-3
= 0               
∴QH= W2-3
Similarly,Q4-1= W4-1since U4-1= 0
∴QC= W4-1
So,
W
2
to
3
is
0,
I
said
rather ,
U
2
to
3
is
0.
So,
Q
2
to
3
is
W
2
to
3
and
similarly ,
we
can
say
that
Q
4
to
1
is
also
W
4
to
1,
Q
4
to
1
is
this
one,
sorry ,
Q
4
to
1
is
this
one,
right
and
W
4
to
1
is
also
here,
right.
So,
in
both
the
cases,
since,
U
2
to
3
and
W,
rather ,
U
4
to
1
is
0,
we
can
say
that
Q
2
to
3
is
W
2
to
3
and
Q
4
to
1
is
W
4
to
1.
So,
we
can
say
that
Q
h
is
equals
to
w
2
to
3
and
q
c
is
w
4
to
1
right.
Therefore,
we
can
say
that
work
requirement
for
isothermal
process
in
open
system
that
can
be
given,
by
W
2
to
3
is
equal
to
minus
integral
of
2
to
integration
of
between
the
2
to,
state
points
2
and
3,
as
v
dp, right and this is equal  to minus R T h ln of p 3 over p 2  right.Similarly,
So,
a
little
thermodynamics,
if
you
know
then,
it
is
that
v
dp,
can
be
replaced
from
2
to
3,
as
minus
v
dp
is
minus
R
th
ln
p
3
over
p
2
right.
Therefore,
we
can
write
Q
H
is
equal
to
R
T
h
ln
of
p
4
over
p
1,
this
is
Q
C,
and
that
was
Q
H,
right.
So,
Q
H
is
R
T
h
ln
p
2
by
p
3,
and
similarly
W
4
to
1
is,
minus
4
to
1,
v
dp
is
equal
to
minus
R
T
C
ln
of
p
1
over
p
4,
and
therefore,
Q
C
can
be
written
as
R
T
C
ln
p
4
is
to
p
1,
or
p
4
by
p
1
right.
Therefore,
from
these
two
relations,
we
can
write
p
2
by
p
1
is
equal
to
T
H
by
T
C
to
the
power gamma by gamma minus 1, right.  We know that p v gamma is constan,
Also,
we
know .
So,
p
1
v
1
gamma
is
p
2
v
2
gamma
therefore,
we
can
write
p
2
over
p
1
is
T
H
over
T
C
to
the
power
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1,
right
and
this
is
also
is
equal
to
p
3
over
p
4.
So,
we
can
write
that
Q
H
over
T
H
is
equal
to
Q
H
over
T
C.
So,
Q
H
over
T
H
equal
to
Q
C
over
T
C
right.
So,
from
that,
we
can
write,
Q
H
over
T
H
minus
Q
C
over
T
C.
This
is
equal
to
0
right
or
for
a
cyclic
reversible
process
this
is,
that
cyclic
symbol, the cyclic reversible process  d Q over T is equal to 0 right.
So,
for
a
cyclic
reversible
process
d
Q
over
T
is
equal
to
0
therefore,
we
can
write
d
Q
over
T
reversible,
right
this
does
not
change
in
a
cyclic
process
and
that
means,
d
Q
over
T
is
0,
that
Q
H
over
T
H
minus
Q
C
over
T
C
being
equal
to
0,
we,
this
is
nothing,
but,
d
Q.
So,
d
Q
over
T,
T
is
constant.
So,
under
reversible
condition,
this
is
saying
that
it
does
not
change
in
a
cyclic
process
and
therefore,
in
a
cyclic
process
d
Q
over
T
is
equal
to
0
right.
So,
it
is
a
function
of
the
thermodynamic
state
points
only,
right,
because,
d
Q
over T  in a cyclic process is 0. It is a function of the state points only .
Hence,
it
is
the
change
in
a
thermodynamic
property
only,
and
this
property
is
known
as
entropy ,
and
this
is
described
by
the
symbol
capital
S.
Capital
S
is
for
entropy
with
total
mass,
and
small
s
is
entropy
with
per
unit
mass,
right
as
usual
earlier
for
d
Q
for
d
W
we
have
said
and
for
internal
energy
we
also
you
have
said
right.
So,
we
can
write
that
d
S
is
equal
to
d
Q
over
T
reversible,
right,
or
we
also
can
write
d
Q
reversible
is
equal
to
T
d
S.
So,
for
a
reversible
system,
d
Q
is
equal
to
T
d
S,
right
where,
d
S
is
the
change
in
entropy
and
T
is
a
constant
right.
This
equation
can
be
written
for
unit
mass
of
the
working fluid as d s small, is equal  to d Q over T reversible, this is for unit mass.
As
I
said
that
for
entire
mass
it
is
capital
S,
entropy ,
is
expressed
and
for
per
unit
mass
it
is
small
s
as
it
is
expressed
right.
So,
per
unit
mass
d
s
is
d
Q
over
T
reversible
right.
Now ,
s
is
the
specific
entropy
in
kilo
joules
per
kg
per
kelvin.
So,
mind
this
unit
also,
that
entropy
unit
is,
let
me
write
here
entropy
in,
so
that
you
do
not
forget
entropy
unit,
is
kilo
joules
per
kg
per
kelvin,
or
degree
centigrade
right,
so,
that
you
do
not
forget
kilo
joules
per
kg
per
degree
centigrade
as
the
entropy .
For
a
finite
reversible
process,
between state points 1 and 2, it is also used as criteria  for equilibrium.
dQrev= T dS ;and,dWrev= p dV       From firstlaw, dU = dQ – dW,  substituting, we get,
dU = T dS – p dV,   or, T dS = dU + p dV,
we also know that
H = U + p V;  or, dH = p dV + V dp; 
∴
 T dS = dH – V dp
For
an
actual
process,
which
is
not
reversible
then,
what
happens
to
d
S?
d
S
is
always
greater
than
d
Q
over
T
for
irreversible
process.
For
irreversible
process
d
S
is
always
greater
than
d
Qover
T
right.
Then
another
very
important
statement,
or
situation
comes
up,
that
is
called
Clausius
inequality .
Now ,
Clausius
inequality
can
be
said
that
one
of
the
mathematical
form
of
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics.
For
a
closed
system
under going
cyclic
process
is
the
Clausius
inequality ,
which
states
that
cyclic
integration
that
is
d
Q
over
T
is
equal
to
0
and
can
be
used
to
derive
maximum
efficiency
and
COP
of the engine and also refrigerating systems.T ds = du + p dv;  T ds = dh – v dp
For
real
processes
that
is
irreversible
process,
the
entropy
always
increases
and
that
is
why
you
might
have
heard
that
entropy
of
the
universe
is
increasing.
Obviously ,
the
more
entropy
is
increasing,
the
more
it
becomes
chaotic,
and
the
more
it
be,
leads
to
be
destroyed
right.
So,
for
real
processes
that
is
irreversible
process
the
entropy
always
increases.
This
is
proved
for
an
isolated
system
that
is
one
which
does
not,
in
which
does
not
involve
any
heat
transfer ,
any
mass
transfer
and
any
work
transfer .
Any
system
along
with its surroundings  that is the universe can also be considered as isolated system.
The
corollary
of
second
law
states
that
the
entropy
of
an
isolated
system
either
increases
or
remains
constant.
It
does
not
go
negative,
either
increases
or
remains
constant.
So,
the
corollary
of
second
law
states
that
the
entropy
of
an
isolated
system
either
increases
or
remains
constant
right.
So,
you
can
say
that
the
second
law
is
known
as
limit
law
or
limiting
law.
It
gives
the
upper
limit
of
efficiency
of
heat
engine
and
the
COP
of
refrigeration systems and also gives the direction that process can flow.
Now ,
there
are
some
fundamental
relations,
which
are
also
required
in
thermodynamics,
that
from
the
measured
data
on
a
few
properties,
determination
of
several
thermodynamic
properties
can
be
made,
using
some
general
relationships.
From
the
definition
of
entropy
and
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
it
can
be
written
that
dQ
reversible
is
T
ds.
So,
dQ
reversible
is
T
ds
and
dW
reversible
is
pdv
right.
So,
from
first
law,
we
know ,
dU,
here
you
see
we
have
written
capital
U,
that
is
for
entire
mass.
So,
dU
is
equal
to
dQ
minus
dW.
Now ,
substituting
this,
we
get
dU
is
equal
to
T
ds,
because,
dQ
is
T
dS
that
we
know .
So,
dU
is
T
dS
minus
pdv
because
dW
is
pdv
or
we
can
write
T
ds
is
equal
to
dU
plus
pdv
and
we
also
know
earlier
we
have
seen
that
h
is
equal
to
U
plus
pv.
Therefore,
we
can  write dh is equal  to pdv plus vdp. Then we can say that T dS equal to dh minus vdp.
T
dS
equal
to
dh
minus
vdp.
On
per
unit
mass
first
fundamental
relation
on
thermodynamics
can
be
written
as
T
ds
is
equal
to
du
plus
pdv
and
second
fundamental
relation
of
thermodynamics
that
can
be
written
as
T
ds
is
equal
to
dh
minus
vdp
right.
T
ds
equal
to
dh
minus
vdp.
Two
things
we
have
said
one
is
T
ds
is
du
plus
pdv
and
another
is
T
ds
is
dh
minus
vdp.
So,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
because,
subsequently ,
they
will
be
utilized.
Now ,
third
law
of
thermodynamics
says
that
it
gives
the
definition
of absolute value of entropy and also states that absolute 0  cannot be reached.
It
states
that
the
entropy
of
perfect
crystals
is
0
at
absolute
0.
This
law
also
states
that
entropy
is
a
measure
of
disorder
of
the
system.
So,
another
form
of
this
law
states
that
absolute
0
cannot
be
achieved
right.
So,
if
we
look
back
to
third
law
it
says
that
absolute
value
of
entropy
is
and
also
states
that
absolute
0
cannot
be
reached.
It
states
also
that
the
entropy of the perfect crystals  is 0 at absolute 0.
Since
absolute
0
is
not
reachable
so,
entropy
of
perfect
crystal
becoming
absolute
0
isalso
impractical.
This
law
states
that
the
entropy
is
measure
of
disorder
which
we
said,
I
said
earlier ,
that
the
universe
entropy
is
increasing.
So,
the
disorder
of
the
universe
is
increasing,
right.
So,
another
form
of
this
third
law
can
be
said
that
the
absolute
0
cannot
be
achieved
right.
So,
we
have
learnt
all
laws
of
thermodynamics
along
with
a
new
function called entropy and also the Carnot heat engine cycle right.
We
have
analyzed
a
little
in
detail
we
will
be
analyzing
afterwards
when
we
go
to
Carnot
system
right.
So,
with
this
we
conclude
today's
class
and
next
day
let
us
see
we
will look  into the further details. Thank you.
