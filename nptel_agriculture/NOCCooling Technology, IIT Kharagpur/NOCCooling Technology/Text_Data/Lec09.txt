Cooling Load Calculation Contd.
Good
evening.
We
are
still
doing
some
calculations,
some
more
knowledge
on
heat
load
or
cooling
load,
right
or
in
terms
of
refrigeration
load
that
we
are
doing
and
previous
class
we
have
talked
about
what
is
the
effect
of
door
opening
right.
Now ,
let
us
come
to
another
very
important
and
that
is
called
heat
generation
right.
So,
there
are
many
ways
by
which
heat
can
be
generated,
many
ways.
For
example,
here
we
have
given,
some
sources
of
heat
generations
are
like
motors.
Motors
may
be
inside
the
room
or
outside
the
room,
depending
on
situation,
if
it
is
inside
the
room
one
type
of
heat
transfer ,
if
it
is
outside
the
room
another
type
of
heat
transfer
that
is
what
we
have
given
some
numerical
values,
so
that
you
understand
the
differences
and
you
know
some
values,
which
are
associated.
Now
motors
are,
may
be
inside
the
room
for
different
reasons,
for
running
something
for
many
other
reasons.
So,
if
motors
are
inside
a
refrigerated
room
heat
is
generated at the rate of 1025.5 watt  per hp again depending on the motor size.
Generally ,
our
all
household
needs,
we
have
seen,
the
motors
are
generally
0.25,
0.5
hp
or
1
hp
at
the
most,
but
in
commercial
level
it
may
be
several
hps,
right.
So,
it
is
1025.5
watt
per
hp
and
if
the
motors
are
outside
the
refrigerated
room,
but
the
load
it
drives
is
outside, then the rate of heat generation is 732.
5
watt
per
hp
right.
So,
if
the
motors
are
inside,
one
type
of
heat
generation,
if
the
motors
are
outside,
another
type
of
heat
generation,
and
the
difference
is
substantial,
right
one
is
1025.5
per
hp
another
is
732.5
watt
per
hp.
Now
this
is
one
way
of
generation of heat.
There
can
be
other
ways,
like,
people,
I
told
many
times
that
people
go
inside
with
the
bags
full
of
the
commodity
which
is
to
be
stored
or
taken
out.
So,
they
also
incorporate
lot
of
heat.
For
example,
if
workers
are
there,
they
generally
generate
around
293
watt
per
person
inside
a
refrigerated
room.
So,
293
watt
per
person
this
is
a
unique
number .
So,
somewhere
300
watts
per
person
is
generated
and
generally
in
any
big
cold
roomthere
are,
I
mean,
tens
of
people
who
are
working
inside,
some
or
other
kind
of
work
is
doing.
So,
a
constant
heat
source
of
say
293
into
1015
so
much
wattage
is
unavailable
because
of
the
persons
who
are
working.
Another ,
as
I
told
also
earlier ,
light.
So,
it
dissipate
heat
that
is
equal
to
the
wattage
of
the
lamp.
Generally ,
we
know
the
lamp
wattage,
60,
100,
200
wattage
of
the
lamp
that
depends
on
that
how
the
cold
room
is
built
up
right.
However , this gives an idea about the light, which is inside the cold room.
Then
as
we
said
earlier ,
respiration,
generation
of
heat,
light,
from
the
light,
from
the
people,
from
the
motors,
are
the
generation.
Respiration
is
also
another
kind
of
generation
So,
if
the
commodity
stored
is
fruits
and
vegetables,
then
it
respires
heat
of
respiration
adds
to
the
refrigeration
load.
Generally ,
this
heat
of
respiration
is
a
function
of
temperature
and
can
be
calculated
as
this
is
also
an
empirical
relation
as
Q
equal
to
A
into
e
to
the
power
B
T,
q
=
a
(e)
bT
;
B
into
T,
where
Q
is
the
rate
of
heat
generation
in
milli
watt
per
kg,
A
and
B
are
the
constants
that
varies
for
different
fruits
and
vegetables
or
different
commodities.
T
is
of
course,
the
temperature
at
which
heat
of
respiration
is
calculated,
right.
So,
heat
of
respiration
decreases
as
temperature
of
the
refrigerated
room decreases.
This
also
I
told
you
earlier ,
given
the
example
of
people,
who
are
in
the
high
altitude,
their
respiration
rates
are
less
than
people
who
are
in
the
sea
level,
right.
Because
at
high
altitude,
temperature
is
low
so,
the
heat
of
refrigeration
or
heat
of
respiration
is
also
low.
Whereas,
people
who
are
on
the
bank
of
the
river
or
on
the
sea
level
their
heat
of
respiration
is
much
higher ,
right.
So,
we
can,
this
is
a
very
very
empirical
relation,
where
A
and
B
are
constant
and
this
constants
are
dependent
on
the
commodities
which
are
being
used,
right.
So,
let
us
look
into
an
average
heat
of
respiration
is
calculated
between two extreme temperatures  of the room say T 1 and T 2.
I
believe
you
also
know
it
very
well
that
if
you
are
in
your
house
and
if
the
house
or
door
or
rather
room
is
a
little
big
say
20
by
20
feet,
then,
you
may
have
conditioners
or
cooling
or
fans,
and
it
is
not
that
the
fans
are
at
every
point,
maybe
at
two
locations,
or
three
locations,
fans
are
there.
By
chance,
if
you
have
a
digital
temperature
indicator ,
of
course,
it
will
have
one
thermocouple,
or
sensor .
So,
if
you
roam
around
the
room
you
will
see
that
the
room
temperature
is
not
same
though
the
fans
are
running
or
if
there
is
conditioner ,
air
conditioner
also,
or
cooling
also,
then
also
it
is
not
that
every
point,
the
temperatures
are
uniformly
same,
right.
So,
this
is
obvious,
and
we
are
saying
that
if
those
conditions,
two
extreme
conditions
are
T
1
and
T
2
then
the
average
of
them
can
be
said
that
the
heat
of
respiration
is
average
of
those
two
T
1
and
T
2
right.
And
if
the
time
required
for
the
two
temperatures
are
T
1
and
T
2
as
delta
T
and
if
the
change
of
the
temperature
is
linear ,
if
it
is
non-linear
then
it
is
very
very
difficult,
not
difficult
it
becomes more mathematical oriented.
If
it
is
linear
then
you
can
do
it
very
easily
so,
if
the
changes
are
linear
and
the
time
required
for
the
temperature
to
drop
from
T
1
to
T
2.
If
T
1
is
higher
and
T
2
is
lower
and
then,
how
you
want
to
find
out
the
average
temperature,
rate
of
respiration.
Then
there
is
a
correlation
between
the
heat
transfer
rate
and
the
delta
T
as
well
as
the
coefficients
constants
right.
So,
we
can
say
that
the
average
rate
of
heat
of
respiration
over
a
time
period
of
delta
T
small
t
this
can
be
calculated
from
the
relation
as
q
is
equal
to
1
by
delta
0
to
delta
T
A
into
e
to
the
power
B
into
T
into
delta
T.
I
repeat
the
average
heat
of
respiration
that
can
be
said
as
q
is
equals
to
1
by
delta
T
in
0
to
delta
T
into
A
into
e
to
the power B capital T into delta T time this  a again  empirical relation right.
So
if
the
temperature
change
is
linear
then
we
can
surely
write
that
T
minus
T
1
is
equals
to
T
1
minus
T
2
over
delta
T
into
T
right.
So,
T
minus
T
1
by
T
small
t
is
equals
to
capital
T
1
minus
capital
T
2
by
delta
T
of
course,
capital
T's
are
temperatures
and
small
t's
are
time
right.
Then
we
can
write
that
relation
again
in
a
better
way
as
q
equal
to
A
into
e
to
the
power
B
T
1
over
B
into
T
1
minus
T
2,
T
1,
if
it
is
higher
times
1
minus
e
to
the
power
minus
B
T
1
minus
T
2
right.
I
repeat
that
the
rate
of
heat
of
respiration
can
be
found
out
as
A
into
e
to
the
power
B
T
1
over
B
into
capital
T
1
minus
capital
T
2
into
1
minus
e
to
the
power
B
into
T
1
minus
T
2
where
T
1
and
T
2
are
the
temperatures
right.  This is a or this is an empirical relation.
So,
we
can
find
out
how
the
heat
of
respiration
amounts
by
doing
some
problem
so
that
the
quantum
of
heat
generation
this
we
can
find
out
easily .
For
example,
apples
are
cooled
from
35
degree
centigrade
to
2
degree
centigrade
in
5
hour
time.
Calculate
the
heat
of
respiration
during
this
cooling
period.
The
coefficients
of
heat
of
respiration
of
apple are A equal to 19.4 milliwatt per kg  and B equal to 0.
108
degree
centigrade
inverse.
Inverse
of
degree
centigrade
that
is
the
unit
of
B
and
unit
of
A
is
milliwatt
per
kg
of
the
material.
So
in
this
case
we
are
talking
about
apple
had
it
been
say
guava
or
say
mango
then
these
values
of
A
and
B
would
have
been
different.
So
the
rate
of
heat
respiration
we
can
find
out
from
this
problem
as
like
this.
Apples
are
cooled from 35 degree centigrade to 2 degree centigrade in 5 hour time.
Calculate
the
heat
of
respiration
during
this
cooling
period.
The
coefficients
for
heat
of
respiration
for
apple
are
A
equal
to
19.4
milliwatt
per
kg
and
B
equal
to
0.108
degree
in
centigrade
inverse
right.
Obviously ,
we
know
that
relation
just
in
the
previous
one,
I
go
back
to
that,
this,
we
had
shown
empirical
relation
Q
is
equal
to
A
into
e
to
the
power
B
T 1 over B into T 1 minus  T 2 times 1 minus e to the power minus B into T 1 minus T 2.
If
we
use
this
then
we
substitute
the
values
then
it
becomes
Q
is
equal
to
19.4
over
0.108
into
e
to
the
power
0.108
into
delta
T
that
is
35
over
0.108,
that
is
the
value
of
B
into
T
1
minus T 2, is 35 minus 2 that is 33 into 1 minus e to the power minus 1.
08
into
35
minus
2.
So,
if
we
solve
it
here,
the
values
are
like
that
T
1
is
35,
T
2
is
2
degree
and
A
is
19.4
whereas
B
is
0.108.
So,
only
these
four
are
used
and
we
get
the
value of heat of respiration of apples between  35 to 2 degree centigrade as 231.
7
milliwatt
per
kg,
231.7
milliwatt
per
kg
mind
it,
right.
So,
231.7
kilo
milliwatt
per
kg
that
means,
if
you
have
100000
kg.
So,
100000
into
231.7
milliwatt,
yes
for
milli
100000
goes out.
So,
it
becomes
231
into
100
that
means,
23170,
so
much
of
watt
per
100000
kg,
right.
So,
this
gives
us
an
idea.
Next
another
problem
if
you
look
at
the
coefficients
for
heat
of
respiration of head latches are  26.7 milliwatt per kg and 0.
088
degree
centigrade
inverse.
What
is
the
refrigeration
load
if
head
latches
is
kept
at
a
constant
temperature
of
3
degree
centigrade?
I
repeat
the
coefficients
for
heat
of
respiration
of
head
lettuce
are
26.7
milliwatt
per
kg
and
0.088
per
degree
centigrade.
What
is
the
refrigeration
load
if
head
latches
is
kept
at
a
constant
temperature
of
3
degree
centigrade?
Now ,
we
have
seen,
in
the
beginning,
it
was
a
relation
that
Q
is
equal
to
A
into
e
to
the
power
B
into
t
that
was
one
such
relation
if
you
remember .
So,
if
you
substitute those values of A and B and temperature T, then we get 26.
7
into
e
to
the
power
0.088
into
3
is
equal
to
34.7,
so
much
below
milliwatt
per
kg
right.
So,
this
is
for
head
latches,
both
are
of
course,
good
respiring
and
this
we
have
seen
that
the
heat
of
respiration
is
around
34.7
milliwatt
per
kg
right.
So,
what
we
then
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
heat
of
respiration
is
also
one
of
the
major
heat
load
and
heat
of
respiration
is
also
seen
as
a
function
of
temperature
as
well
there
are
some
correlations
available and these correlations are function of the  material.
If
the
material
is
known
and
its
constant
values
are
known
and
if
the
temperature
from
where
to
where
it
is
getting
changed
is
known
then
I,
it
is
seen
that
we
can
predict
the
respiration
rate
from
the
given
empirical
relations
and
once
the
empirical
relations
are
used
perhaps
we
get
the
heat
of
respiration
very
very
accurately
and
that
gives
us
one
type
of
heat
load
and
other
loads
which
we
also
discussed
are
the
load.
There
is
also
one
more
load
which
we
have
not
said
is
the
fan.
In
most
of
the
cold
rooms
to
have
the
temperature
difference
as
little
as
possible,
but
to
have
the
convective
coefficient
convective
heat
transfer
lot
many
fans
are
used
and
each
fan
has
an
wattage
that
is
also
known.
So,
if
the
wattage
of
the
fans
are
known
and
wattage
of
the
lights
which
we
have
also
said
is
known
then
we
can
find
out
what
is
the
load
from
the
product
itself.
Number
1
respiration,
number
2
the
handling
of
it
and
the
other
loads
such
as
load
due
to
our
motors
which
are
used
for
many
cases,
then
human
beings,
which
are
going
in
and
out
for
number
of
times
and
doors,
which
are
opened
and
closed
very
irregularly
or
in
most
of the cases during the loading of the cold room.
In
most
of
the
cases,
it
is
seen
that
the
door
remains
open.
And
in
that
case,
we
have
also
shown
that
size
of
the
door
is
a
definitely
function
of
the
heat
load
because
size
of
the
door,
if
it
is
a
household
refrigerator
size
of
the
door
and
actually
it
may
be
several
times,
several
times
the
area
of
the
household
refrigerator
then
of
course,
the
load
of
the
heat
will
be
quite
different.
So,
if
you
have
questions
you
may
ask
and
of
course,
you
will
have
some
platform
from
where
you
can
raise
your
questions
and
supporting
people
will
be
answering
to
them
right.
So,
at
least
new
things
which
you
have
come
across
is
the
respiration
heat,
is
the
heat
due
to
motors,
right
these
and
the
heat
load
per
person,
who
is
entering
and
coming
out
each
time,
how
much
quantity
that
you
have
alreadyfound
out,
right.
So,
I
hope
you
are
able
to
get
it
and
next
after
the
respiration
load
we
may be going  into the basics of thermodynamics.
So,
unless
we
know
the
basics
of
thermodynamics
where
all
the
laws
are
also
recapitulated
and
also
all
the
laws
in
the
meaning
that
thermochemistry
or
chemistry
oriented
reactions
or
relations
they
are
also
to
be
looked
into
and,
but
mostly
it
is
thermal
right
mostly
it
is
thermal
because
we
are
handling
with
thermal
only
because
heating
being
a
thermal
cooling
is
also
a
thermal.
So,
we
should
know
that
how
heating
and
cooling
both
are
getting
into
the
heat
load
right.
So,
with
this
I
think
we
can
complete
that
cooling
load
calculations
once
we
have
the
cooling
load
someday
we
will
also
come
that
how
much
tonnage
of
refrigeration
is
one
ton
of
refrigeration
is
what
is
the
kilowattage
of
that
right
roughly
it
is
3.5.
So,
once
we
know
the
cooling
load
or
heating
cooling
load
in
this
case
then
we
know
the
tonnage
of
refrigeration
required
because
one
ton of refrigeration is roughly 3.
5
other
decimals
are
also
there
3.5
kilowatt
right.
So,
with
this
we
complete
this
cooling
load calculation class.  Thank you.
