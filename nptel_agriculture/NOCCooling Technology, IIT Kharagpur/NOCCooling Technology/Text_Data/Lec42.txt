Good
afternoon
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
my
dear
friends.
T oday
we
shall
start
the
individual
components,
right.
W e
are
in
the
9th
week
ok.
So,
today
we
shall
do
individual
components.
For
example,
one
of
the
most
important,
which
normally
is
called,
heart
of
the
refrigeration
system,
that
is,
compressor ,
right.
So,
we
will
do
on
compressor
and
as
I
told
obviously ,
we
will
cover
most
of
the
part,
which
is
required,
but
it
could
be
that,
some,
we
can
skip
and
allow
you
to
read.
And,
hopefully ,
not
only
this,
I
have
no
idea
of
course,
I
cannot
commit
that,
the
slides
could
be
available
to
you.
I
have
no
idea
about
that,
but
definitely ,
the
lectures
you
can
access,
right,
those,
who
are
registering
for
the
course,
right.
I
again
repeat,
some
day
back,
I
told
that
this
course
is
designed,
I
have
designed,
is
designed
means,
I
have
designed
in
such
a
way
that,
this
is
very
very
helpful
for
agricultural
and
food
engineering
only ,
food
engineering
or
food
technology
etc.
Then,
chemical
engineering,
then,
mechanical
engineering
and
also
civil
engineering,
because,
if
even
civil
people,
they
do
not
know
refrigeration.
So,
how
can
they
go
on
building
the
system,
typically
the
storage
facilities,
right.
So,
this
will
be
very
helpful
course
for
multidiscipline,
ok.
Now
let
us
come
to
the
compressor .
So,
what
is
a
compressor?
It
is
a
device
that
is
used
for
pumping
compressible
fluids
that
is
air ,
gas,
steam,
whatever
it
be,
right.
So,
it
is
a
device
pumping
compressible
fluids,
that
is
a
compressor .
Then,
what
is
the
basic
dif ference
between
a
compressor
and
a
blower?
W e
have
seen,
blower
blowing
lot
of
air
and
many
others.
So,
what
is
the
dif ference
between
a
blower
and
a
compressor
right.
According
to
API,
pressure
rise
above
0.35
bar
is
compressor ,
and
below
is
blower .
So,
it
is
basically
a
pressure,
right.
So,
anything
beyond
0.35
bar
is
under going
to
the
head
of
compressor
and
less
than
that
is
the
blower .
Now
basic
some
techniques,
or
some
terminologies
are
required,
that
is
flow
rate,
is
in
meter
cube
per
hour ,
or
it
could
be
CFM,
that
is
cubic
feet
per
minute,
right.
One
CFM
is
roughly
point
not,
roughly
exactly
0.586meter
cube
per
hour .
Pressure
ratio,
that
is
ratio
of
absolute
dischar ge
pressure,
and
absolute
inletpressure.
Now ,
again,
I
will,
let
me
tell,
one
more,
once
more,
rather ,
that
inlet
pressure
is
normally
suction
pressure,
and
exit
pressure
is
normally ,
dischar ge
pressure.
Here,
we
have
directly
said
that
absolute
pressure
is
that
gauge
pressure
plus
atmospheric
pressure,
is
the
absolute
pressure.
Have
you
seen
any
gauge?
If
you
have
seen,
let
me
tell
that,
this
gauge
looks
like
this,
and
it
is
graduated
and
there
is
indicator ,
like
this,
which
is
at
0,
if
it
is
not
in
use
right.
So,
0
gauge
pressure,
like
here,
if
it
is
0,
then
absolute
pressure
is
the
atmospheric
pressure,
but
if
you
have
some
pressure
in
the,
if
you
have
some,
sorry ,
if
you
have
some
pressure
in
the
gauge,
then
your
absolute
pressure
is
that,
plus
the
atmospheric
pressure.
Obviously ,
atmospheric
pressure
is
the
pressure
exerted
by
the
atmosphere.
At
the
sea
level,
atmospheric
pressure
is
1.033
kg
per
centimeter
square,
and
area
A
is
one,
say ,
rather
at
1.033
kg
/
centimeter
square
and
is
equal
to
1.013
bar ,
and
is
equal
to
14.696
psi
absolute,
all
are
in
absolute,
right.
This
is
also
in
absolute,
this
is
also
in
absolute,
this
is
also
in
absolute,
and
this
is
also
in
absolute,
right.
So,
that,
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
that
the
relation
between
pressures,
and
also
equal
to
760
millimeter
of
mercury ,
or
it
could
be,
1
atmosphere.
Now ,
1
kg
per
centimeter
square,
that
is
equal
to
14.22
psi,
and
1
mega
Pascal
is
10.1
bar .
Obviously ,
we
have
said
earlier
also
that
0
degree
centigrade
is
roughly
taken
as
273
Kelvin,
right.
So,
a
compressor
is
the
most
important
and
often
the
costliest
component,
typically
around
30
to
40
percent
of
the
total
cost
of
the
refrigeration
system,
if
it
is
under
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system.
The
function
of
the
compressor ,
in
a
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
is
to
continuously
draw
the
refrigerant
vapour
from
the
evaporator ,
so
that
a
low
pressure
and
low
temperature
can
be
maintained
in
the
evaporator
at
which
the
refrigerant
can
boil
extracting
heat
from
the
refrigerated
space.
The
compressor ,
then,
has
to
raise
the
pressure
of
the
refrigerant
to
a
level
at
which
it
can
condense
by
rejecting
heat
to
the
cooling
medium
in
the
condenser ,
right.
So,
classification
of
compressors
can
be
made
in
this
way ,
that
compressors
used
in
refrigeration
system
can
be
classified
in
several
ways.
Number
1,
based
on
the
working
principle,
that
is,
whether
it
is
positive
displacement
type,
or
rotodynamic
type.
If
it
is
positive
displacement
type
compressor ,
then,
compression
is
achieved
by
trapping
a
refrigerant
vapour
into
an
enclosed
space
and
then
reducing
its
volume.
Since
a
fixed
amount
of
refrigerant
is
trapped
each
time,
its
pressure
rises
as
its
volume
is
reduced.
When
the
pressure
rise
to
a
level,
that
a
slightly
higher
than
the
condensing
pressure,
then
it
is
expelled
from
the
enclosed
space
and
a
fresh
char ge
of
low
pressure
refrigerant
is
drawn
in
and
the
cycle
continues,
right.So,
we
can
say ,
depending
upon
the
construction,
positive
displacement
type
compressors
used
in
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning,
can
also
be
classified
into
as
we
said
reciprocating
type,
or
rotary
type
with
sliding
vanes,
that
is,
rolling
piston
type
or
multiple
vanes
type,
or
it
can
be
rotary
screw
type,
that
is,
single
screw
or
twin
screw
type,
or
it
can
be
an
orbital
compressor
and
lastly
it
could
be
acoustic
compressors,
right.
Then,
unlike
positive
displacement
type,
the
rotary
dynamic
type
compressors
are
steady
flow
devices.
Therefore,
these
are
subjected
to
less
wear
and
tear .
Depending
upon
the
construction,
rotary
dynamic
type
compressors
can
be
also
classified
into
either
radial
flow
type
or
axial
flow
type
right.
I
hope,
axial
flow
you
know
at
your
house,
you
have
the
fan
on
your
head,
right
it
is
rotating
and
this
is
called
axial
fan,
ok.
Axial
compressors
also
known
as
turbo
compressors,
are
radial
flow
type
rotary
dynamic
compressors.
These
compressors
are
widely
used
in
lar ge
capacity
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
systems.
Axial
flow
compressors
are
normally
used
in
gas
liquefaction
applications,
right.
Then,
it
can
be
based
on
that
division,
or
the
type
can
also
be
based
on
arrangements
of
compressor
motor ,
or
external
drive.
So,
it
can
be
open
type,
it
can
be
hermetic
or
type,
it
can
be
semi
hermetic
or
semi
type.
The
other
day ,
when
I
was
talking
about
household
refrigerator ,
there
also,
I
said
that
the
compressor
is
hermetically
.
Hermetically
means,
you
will
look
you
will
see
complete
this
kind
of
enclosed
thing,
where,
there
are
two,
one
is
inlet
and
another
is
outlet
there,
and
normally
they
are
capped,
normally ,
right,
before
it
is
used.
So,
that
is
hermetically
type,
but
open
type
one,
which
we
come
across
is
the
one,
which
normally
used
in
the
higher
level
of
refrigeration
requirement,
right.
So,
there,
it
is
open
type
because,
hermetically
types
are
with
the
small
capacities,
or
small
refrigeration
or
tonnage
requirement.
There
is,
and
another
thing,
this
hermetically
sealed
compressors
are
hermetically ,
they
are
so
absolutely .
So,
its
maintenance
is
a
very
very
problem.
Normally ,
it
does
not
go
wrong.
Have
you
ever
seen
that
your
household
refrigerator ,
the
compressor
has
gone
wrong?
It
may
be
some
other ,
may
be
a
little
condenser ,
or
mostly
the
evaporator
coil
or
insulation,
may
be,
but,
compressor ,
you
have
never
seen,
it
has
gone
wrong,
right.
So,
they
are
well
made
for
which,
it
can
be
trusted,
and
it
can
be
said
that,
the
hermetically
sealed
compressors
work
more
or
less
lifelong.
There
is
another
one,
which
is
called
semi
hermetically
sealed
type
compressor .
This
hermetically
sealed
are
not
possible
to
open,
or
repair
easily .
Semi
hermetically
is
made
in
such
a
way
that,
a
part
can
be
opened
and
can
be
repaired,
if
required.
It
is
definitely
a
better
one,
than
the
hermetically
sealed,
but
obviously ,
the
cost
will
goup.
So,
for
a
given
refrigeration
unit,
if
hermetically
sealed
are
doable,
then,
why
you
will
go
for
the
semi
hermetically
ones,
right.
In
open
type
compressors,
the
rotating
shaft
of
the
compressor
extends
through
a
seal
in
the
crank
case
for
an
external
drive.
The
external
drive
may
be
an
electrical
motor
or
an
engine,
for
example,
diesel
engine
or
similar .
The
compressor
may
be
belt
driven
or
gear
driven.
Open
type
compressors
are
normally
used
in
medium
to
lar ge
capacity
refrigeration
system,
for
all
refrigerants
and
for
ammonia
in
particular ,
right.
Compressors,
due
to
its
ammonia,
means,
due
to
its
incompatibility
with
hermetic
motor
materials,
they
are
normally
not
used.
Ammonia
is
normally
not
used
in
hermetically
sealed
compressors.
Open
type
compressors
are
characterized
by
high
ef ficiency ,
flexibility ,
better
compressor
cooling
and
serviceability ,
which
is
a
very
very
fundamental.
It
is
open
type,
but
it
is
not
serviceable,
and
the
compressor
is
not
working
and
the
people
are,
they
are,
they
are
not
able
to
work.
So,
serviceability
is
one
of
the
primary
consideration
.
However ,
since
the
shaft
has
to
extend
through
the
seal,
leakage
of
refrigerant,
rather
refrigerant
leakage
from
the
system
cannot
be
eliminated
completely .
That
is
why ,
in
most
of
the
engine
room,
that
is,
where
the
compressors
are
there,
they
call
it
to
be
an
engine
room.
If
you
go
there,
you
will
find
some
or
other
obviously ,
ammonia,
I
do
not
say
flavor ,
here,
some
odor .
So,
that
is
making
it
to
understand
that
leakage
is
happening.
Whereas,
if
it
is
CFC,
it
does
not
have
any
such
odor .
So,
if
there
is
a
leak,
you
cannot
identify ,
other
than
going
through
the
pressure.
But,
if
it
is
ammonia,
as
refrigerant,
you
can
easily
find
out,
or
recognize
that,
some
leakage
is
happening,
right.
So,
it
cannot
be
again
from
compressor ,
say
from
compressor ,
then,
condenser ,
then
evaporator ,
either
expansion
device,
then
evaporator ,
back
to
compressor .
It
is
a
huge
part,
right,
and
many
lines
and
joints
are
there.
So,
it
is
likely
that,
there
could
be
some
or
other
kind
of
leakage
and
which
is
detectable
by
its
odor .
Most
refrigeration
systems,
using
open
type
compressors,
require
a
refrigerant
reservoir ,
to
take
care
of
the
refrigerant
leakage
for
some
time,
and
then
regular
maintenance,
for
char ging
the
system
with
refrigerant,
char ging
of
sealed
gasket,
etc.
are
also
taken
care
of
in
hermetically
sealed
compressors.
So,
the
motor
and
the
compressor
are
enclosed
in
the
same
housing
to
prevent
refrigeration
leakage.
The
housing
has
welded
connections
for
refrigerant
inlet
and
outlet
and
for
power
input
socket.
As
a
result
of
this,
there
is
virtually
no
possibility ,
there
is
virtually
no
possibility
of
refrigerant
leakage,
from
the
compressor .
All
motors
reject
a
part
of
the
power
supplied
to
it
due
to
eddy
currents.
I
hope
eddy
currents,
you
know ,
I
am
not,
because,
we
have
time
very
limited.
So,
I
am
not
going
into
that
also.
So,
eddy
currents
and
frictionthat
is
inef ficiencies.
Similarly ,
the
compressor
also
gets
heated
up
due
to
friction,
and
also
due
to
temperature
rise
of
the
vapour
during
compression.
So,
in
open
type,
both
the
compressor ,
and
the
motor ,
normally ,
reject
heat
to
the
surrounding
air
for
ef ficient
operation.
So,
in
hermetically
sealed
compressors,
heat
cannot
be
rejected
to
the
surrounding
air ,
since,
both
are
enclosed
in
a
shell.
Hence,
the
cold
suction
gas
is
made
to
flow
over
the
motor
and
the
compressor ,
before
entering
the
compressor ,
this
is
cold
one
is
supplied,
this
keeps
the
motor
cool.
The
motor
winding
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
refrigerant.
Hence
only
those
refrigerants
which
have
high
dielectric
strength
can
be
used
in
hermetic
compressors.
Otherwise,
it
will
be
electrocuted.
So,
high
dielectric
constant,
that
are
used.
So,
can
be
used
as
hermetic
compressor ,
or
with
hermetic
compressors.
The
cooling
rate
depends
upon
the
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant,
its
temperature,
and
the
thermal
properties
of
the
refrigerant.
If
flow
rate
is
not
suf ficient
and
or
if
the
temperature
is
not
low
enough
the
insulation
on
the
winding
of
the
motor
can
burn
out
and
in
that
case
short
circuiting
may
occur .
So,
short
circuiting
is
obviously ,
not
desirable
because
if
there
is
short
circuit
there
may
be
fire.
Hence,
hermetically
sealed
compressors
give
satisfactory
and
safe
performance
over
a
very
narrow
range
of
design
temperature
and
should
not
be
used
for
of f
design
condition.
The
COP
of
the
hermetic
compressor ,
based
on
the
lower ,
I
mean
the
COP
of
the
hermetic
compressor
base
system,
is
lower
than
the
that
of
the
open
compressor
base
system.
Hence,
a
part
of
the
refrigerant
or
refrigeration
ef fect
is
lost
in
cooling
the
motor
and
the
compressor .
In
hermetically
sealed
one,
you
are
using
for
cooling
the
motor ,
a
part
of
the
refrigerant.
So,
COP
is
reduced
there
itself.
However ,
hermetic
compressors
are
almost
universally
used
in
small
systems
such
as
domestic
refrigerator ,
water
coolers,
air
conditioners
etc.
where,
ef ficiency
may
not
be
that
important,
as
customer
convenience,
right.
So,
you
are,
you
are
buying
the
convenience,
with
a
compromise
with
the
ef ficiency ,
right.
So,
due
to
the
absence
of
continuous
maintenance,
your
convenience
goes
up,
because,
once
you
buy ,
you
normally
for get
about
the
compressor ,
if
it
is
hermetically
sealed.
But
the
other
one,
that
is,
open
type
obviously ,
every
now
and
then,
you
have
to
keep
constant
eye
or
constant
supervision,
such
that,
the
compressor
runs
ef fectively ,
right.
In
addition
to
this,
the
use
of
hermetic
compressors,
in
ideal
systems,
which
use
capillary
tubes
as
expansion
devices.
I
said
also
one
day ,
that
household
refrigerators,
you
will
see
that,
capillaries
are
used
as
expansion
device,
and
are
critically
char ged
systems.
Hermetic
compressors
are
normallynot
serviceable.
They
are
not
very
flexible,
as
it
is
dif ficult
to
vary
their
speed
to
control
the
cooling
capacity .
In
some,
normally
lar ger
hermetic
units,
the
cylinder
head
is
usually
removable,
so
that
the
valves
and
the
piston
can
be
serviced
and
this
type
of
unit
is
called
semi
hermetically
sealed
compressor ,
or
semi
sealed
compressor ,
right.
So,
with
these
preamble
of
compressors,
particularly
those,
who
use
mostly ,
one
is
hermetically
and
another
is
that
open
type,
that
is,
your
open
type
one.
So,
these
two
we
have
already
talked
about.
W e
will
see
a
little
design
of
the
hermetic
type,
may
not
be
thoroughly ,
all
over
and
then,
we
will
also
look
into
the
other
types,
like,
your
way ,
as
we
said
that,
centrifugal
or
the
screw
type.
So,
perhaps,
this
ninth
week,
we
will
be
using
mostly ,
the
compressors,
ok.
Our
time
is
up.
So,
thank
you
for
listening.
W e
will
meet
again
in
the
next
class.
