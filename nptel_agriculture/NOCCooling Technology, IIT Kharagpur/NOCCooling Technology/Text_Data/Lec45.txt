Recipr ocating
Compr essor
(Contd.)
Good
afternoon,
my
dear
students
and
friends.
Perhaps,
today
it
should
be
the
last
class
for
the
compressor ,
because,
we
have
still
more,
condenser,
expansion
device,
and
evaporator.
So,
hopefully,
those
will
be
covered
in
another
week,
and
we
will
have
with
us
2
more
weeks,
where,
we
will
do
the
application
side,
right,
Including,
the
last
class.
I
hope,
I
should
take
a
very
good,
I
mean,
mouthwatering,
ice
cream,
right,
how
refrigeration
is
also
working
with
that,
ok.
So,
coming
back
to
the
reciprocating
type
of
compressor ,
no,
maybe
one
more
class
before
condenser,
we
will
cover
up
with
compressor ,
other
type,
like,
that
will
be
very
compact,
that,
screw
type,
and
this
revolving
one,
which
one,
will
be
covering
up,
ok.
Continuation
of
this
reciprocating
type
of
compressors,
where
we
last
left
with,
we
start
from
there,
and
we
had
done
in
the
last
class,
the
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant,
right.
Pv
n
=
constant
Now,
what
is
the
work
input
to
the
compressor
with
clearance
volume?
This
is
what,
we
are
comparing
from
the
no
clearance
in
ideal,
and
another
ideal
with
clearance,
right
which
is,
more
logical
or
more
towards
the
reality,
right.
So,
here,
if
we
assume
that,
both
compression
and
expansion
follow
the
same
equation,
that
is,
p
v
to
the
power
n,
that
is,
equal
to
constant,
that
is,
the
index
of
compression
is
equal
to
the
index
of
expansion.
Then,
the
extra
work
required
to
compress
the
vapour,
that
is
left
in
the
clearance
volume,
will
be
exactly
equal
to
the
work
output
obtained,
during
the
re-expansion
process,
right.
So,
we
can
say,
the
clearance
for
this
special
case,
does
not
impose
any
penalty
on
work
input
to
the
compressor ,
the
total
work
input
to
the
compressor ,
during
the
cycle
will
then
be
equal
to,
the
area
under
A
B
C
D
A
on
the
p
v
diagram,
right.
…
(25)
The
specific
work
with
and
also
without
clearance,
will
be
given
by
the
same
expression,
as
W
id
equal
to
integral
of
V
dp
between
the
limit
pe
to
pc,
and
that
is,
equal
to
pe
ve
into
n
by
n
minus
1
into
pc
by
pe
to
the
power
n
minus
1
by
n,
minus
1.
However,
since
the
mass
of
refrigerant
compressed
during
one
cycle
is
different
with
and
without
clearance,
right.
Then
we
can
write
that,
the
power
input
to
the
compressor ,
will
be
different
with
and
without
clearance.
The
power
input
to
the
compressor
and
mean
effective
pressure,
that
is,
MEP
with
clearance,
that,
those,
can
be
given
as
W
c
equal
to
m
dot
W
id,
that
is
equal
to
yeeta
v
clearance
into
V
dot
sw
over
ve
into
W
id,
and
MEP
can
be
written
as,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance,
v,cl
into
W
id
over
ve.
So,
thus,
the
power
input
to
the
compressor
and
MEP,
decreases
with
clearance,
due
to
decrease
in
mass
flow
rate,
with
clearance.
Therefore,
we
can
write
that,
if
the
process
is
reversible,
and
adiabatic,
that
is,
n
is
equal
to
k,
then
the
power
input
to
the
compressor
with
clearance,
is
given
by,
W
c
equal
to
yeeta
v,cl
into
V
dot
sw
over
ve
into
hB
minus
hA,
that
is,
yeeta
v,cl
into
V
dot
sw
over
ve
into 
delta
hcs,
where
delta
hcs
is
the
isentropic
work
of
compression,
in
kilo
Joules
per
kg. 
Now,
performance
of
reciprocating
compressors,
if
we
look
at
the
specific
objectives
of 
this
part
is
that,
to
discuss
the
performance
aspects
of
ideal
reciprocating
compressor 
with
clearance,
specifically ,
effect
of
evaporator
temperature
on
system
performance
at
a 
fixed
condenser
temperature,
and
effect
of
condenser
temperature
on
system 
performance
at
a
fixed
evaporator
temperature,
which
we
have
shown
earlier
also
in 
other
way,
in
other
classes.
Effects
of
pressure
ratio,
and
type
of
refrigerants,
on 
compressor
discharge
temperature.
Now,
other
part
is,
to
discuss
the
performance
aspects 
of
actual
compressor
of
actual
compression
process
by
considering
effect
of
heat
transfer 
in
the
suction
line
and
compressor
and
effects
of
pressure
drops
in
the
suction
and 
discharge
line
and
across
suction
and
discharge
valves
of
the
compressor .
Effect
of 
refrigerant
leakage,
then,
describe
various
methods
of
capacity
control
and
discuss
the 
methods
of
compressor
lubrication,
right.
At
the
end
of
this,
we
can
come
to
this,
that
you
should
be
able
to
describe
qualitatively , 
the
effects
of
evaporator
and
condenser
temperatures
on
performance
of
reciprocating 
compressor .
Discuss
the
effects
of
heat
transfer,
pressure
drops,
and
refrigerant
leakage 
on
performance
of
actual
compressor .
Explain,
various
methods
of
refrigerating 
capacity,
or
regulating
the
capacity
of
reciprocating
compressors,
and
to
discuss
aspects 
of
compressor
lubrication.
Now,
ideal
compression
with
clearance,
the
effect
of 
evaporator
temperature
on
performance
of
the
system
is
obtained,
by
keeping
the 
condenser
temperature,
or
pressure
and
compressor
displacement
rate
and
clearance
ratio 
fixed.
To
simplify
the
discussion,
it
is
further
assumed
that,
the
refrigeration
cycle,
as
in
say,
SSS,
cycle,
right.
…(29)
SSS
means,
we
have
done
it
earlier.
On
volumetric
efficiency
and
refrigerant
mass
flow
rate,
the
volumetric
efficiency
of
the
compressor
with
clearance,
that
can
be
given
by
yeeta
volumetric
clearance,
equal
to
1
plus
epsilon
minus
epsilon
into
P
c
over
P
e
to
the
power
1
by
n,
equals
to
1
minus
epsilon
R
p
to
the
power
1
by
n
minus,
1.
This
we
have
given,
right,
earlier.
Now,
if
from
here,
what
we
can
see
that,
this
is
a
PV
diagram,
for
different
evaporator
pressures,
and
a
fixed
condenser
pressure,
right.
Different
evaporator
pressure
and
fixed
compressor
pressure.
So,
for
that
compressor
displacement
remains
same
if
the
compressor
displacement
remains
same
the
clearance
volume
efficiency
decreases
as
evaporator
temperature
decreases.
So,
we
can
say
as
we
have
already
explained
at
a
limiting
pressure
ratio
the
volumetric
efficiency
that
becomes
equal
to
0.
At
the
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant
that
can
be
given
as
m
dot
equals
to
yeeta
v,cl
into
v
dot
S
w
over
v
e
right.
As
the
evaporator
temperature
decreases
the
clearance
volume
efficiency
decreases
and
the
specific
volume
of
refrigerant
at
compressor
inlet,
right,
is
negative,
rather
inlet,
that
is
v
e
increases.
As
a
result
of
these
two
effects
the
mass
flow
rate
of
refrigerant
through
the
compressor
decreases
rapidly,
as
it
is,
as
the
evaporator
temperature
decreases,
right.
This
is
shown
in
this
figure
also,
that
how
it
is
behaving.
So,
we
already
we
had
shown
earlier.
So,
let
us,
we
had
shown
earlier,
in
the
sense
that,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
versus
evaporator
temperature
and
versus
the
mass
flow
rate
right.
So,
yeeta
volumetric
clearance
is
increasing
with
mass
flow
rate,
if
you
look
at,
like
this,
and
this
is,
the
mass
flow
rate
is
increasing
with
the
volumetric
clearance.
So,
that
for
a
given
Te,
we
can
see
both
the
things,
right.
Now
on
refrigeration
effect
and
refrigeration
capacity,
if
we
straight
away
go
to
the
ph
diagram,
right,
we
straight
away
go
to
the
ph
diagram
because,
time
is
going
out.
The
refrigeration
capacity
of
the
compressor
Q
e,
that
can
be
given
as
Q
e
is
equal
to
m
dot
into
Q
e,
right.
This
is
effect
of
evaporator
temperature
on
refrigeration
effect
in
a
ph
diagram,
right.
So,
this
is
ph
diagram,
how
the
refrigeration
effect
on
evaporator
temperature
is
affecting,
that
we
are
showing
it
here.
Now,
since,
mass
flow
rate
of
refrigerant
capacity,
since,
mass
flow
rate
of
refrigerant
increases
rapidly,
and
refrigerant
effect
also
increases,
though
marginally,
with
increase
in
evaporator
temperature,
the
refrigeration
capacity
increases
sharply,
with
increase
in
evaporator
temperature,
as
it
is
shown
here
right.
This
is
like
that,
temperature
of
evaporator
and
the
refrigeration
effect
Q
e
at
constant
temperature
right.
This
is
Q
e
for
different,
this
thing,
and
small
q
e,
and
this
is
capital
Q
e,
that
is,
this
is
per
unit
mass,
this
is
the
whole,
which,
we
have
said
earlier
also.
Now,
on
work
of
compression
and
power
requirement,
we
have
seen
that,
the
power
input
to
the
compressor ,
that
is
given
by
W
c
equal
to
m
dot
into
delta
h
c
right,
where,
if
it
is
effect
of
evaporator
temperature
on
the
work
of
compression,
that
is
delta
h
c,
and
power
input
to
the
compressor
W
c
for
a
given
condenser
temperature,
right.
So,
that
is
how
it
is
behaving.
Now,
if
we
look
at,
if
we
look
at
so,
this
part
we
can,
we
can
skip,
otherwise,
we
will
not
be
able
to
complete.
Δ
h
c
(=
h
2
-h
1
)
…(32)
Now,
on
COP
and
volumetric
flow
rate
per
unit
capacity.
The
COP
of
the
system,
that
can
be
defined
as,
COP
is
equal
to
q
e
over
w
c,
that
is,
small
q
e
over
delta
h
c
right.
So,
as
the
evaporator
temperature
increases,
the
refrigeration
effect
q
e
increases
marginally,
and
the
work
of
compression,
that
is,
delta
h
c
e
reduces
sharply.
As
a
result,
the
COP
of
the
system
increases
rapidly,
as
the
evaporator
temperature
increases
and
this
can
be
seen
from
this
figure,
as
it
is
shown,
ok.
Before
that,
the
volume
flow
rate
per
unit
capacity,
that
is,
V,
is,
that
can
be
given
as
V
equal
to
yeeta
V
cl
into
V
sw
over
Q
e,
that
is,
V
e
over
Q
e
right.
And
as
we
said
that,
effect
of
evaporator
temperature
on
COP,
it
varies
like
this
right.
So,
with
the
volume
flow
rate
per
unit
capacity,
v,
right.
So,
this
is
v,
and
this
is
COP,
with
v
meter
cube
per
kilo
watt
per
second,
is
like
that,
and
under
constant
condenser
temperature
right.
So,
effect
of
condenser
temperature,
it
is
also
similar.
Obviously,
not
the
same,
as
that
of
the
evaporator.
So,
we
only
look
at
the
figures,
and
it
is
showing
that,
the
condenser
temperature
yeeta,
volumetric
efficiency,
this
is,
the
mass
flow
rate,
this
is
the
yeeta,
volumetric
efficiency
under
constant
evaporator
temperature,
right.
So,
we
can
skip
it,
otherwise
we
shall
not
be
able
to
talk
on
refrigeration
effect
and
refrigeration
capacity,
right,
that
can
be
seen
from
here,
that,
refrigeration
effect
and
refrigeration
capacity,
that,
this
is
the
refrigeration
effect
and
capacity,
ok.
That
Q
e,
as
we
have
seen,
that
is,
whole
mass
and
small
q
is
the
part
mass,
and
this
is
the
constant,
and
this
is
the
condenser
temperature
under
constant
evaporator
temperature,
right.
So,
on
work
compression
and
power
requirement,
that
also
we
can
see,
this
is
how
it
is
behaving,
it
is
following
right.
Now,
on
COP
and
volume
flow
rate
per
unit
capacity,
that
also
is
seen
from,
here
is
that,
this
is
the
COP,
this
is
the
volume
flow
rate
and
COP
versus
volume
flow
rate,
the
volume
flow
rate
is
increased
like
that,
COP
is
decreasing
like
that,
for
T
with
T
c
against
a
constant
evaporator
temperature.
Now,
compressor
discharge
temperature.
So,
compressor
discharge
temperature,
if
you
look
at
from
the
PV
gamma,
is
equal
to
constant,
and
PV
is
equal
to
RT.
We
can
then,
say
that,
the
discharge
temperature
Td
can
be
given
as,
Td
is
equal
to
Te
into
E
PC
over
P
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
right.
So,
for
a
given
compressor
inlet
temperature,
Te,
the
discharge
temperature
Td
increases
as
the
pressure
ratio
Pc
over
Pe,
that
is,
Rp
and
specific
heat
ratio
gamma,
increases.
Even
though
refrigerant
vapour
may
not
exactly
behave
as
a
perfect
gas,
the
trends
remain
same
right.
So,
in
this
figure,
we
see,
this
is
for
different
refrigerant,
for
ammonia,
for
R
22,
for
R
11,
that
PC
over
Pe
versus
Td,
how
it
is
behaving?
right.
Obviously,
they
are
linear.
So,
we
can
see
the
effect
of
Pc
over
Pe
on
Td
right.
Then,
actual
compression
process.
This
is
deviated
from
the
ideal
compression
process
due
to
heat
transfer
between
the
refrigerant
and
surroundings
during
compression
and
expansion,
which
makes
these
process,
non
adiabatic.
Frictional
pressure
drops
in
connection,
in
connecting
lines,
and
across
suction
and
discharge
valves,
and
losses
due
to
leakage
right.
And
effect
of
heat
transfer
is,
let
us
see
whether
there
is
any
such
ok.
Obviously,
the
effect
of
heat
transfer
will
be
very
very
high,
and
we
can
say
that
isentropic
efficiency
yeeta
is
for
compressor
and
can
be
defined
as
yeeta
is,
isentropic,
is
equal
to
delta
hc,
is
over
delta
hc
actual
right.
Now
we
can,
delta
hc
is
the
isentropic
work
of
compression
and
delta
hc
actual
is
the
actual
work
of
compression.
This
is
observed
that
for
a
given
compressor
the
isentropic
efficiency
of
the
compressor ,
is
mainly
a
function
of
the
pressure
ratio.
Similarly,
it
is
the
function
of
that,
the
function
varies
from
compressor
to
compressor
and
is
obtained
by
conducting
experimental
studies
on
compressors.
The
actual
work
of
the
compression
and
actual
power
input
can
be
obtained
if
the
isentropic
efficiency
of
the
compressor
is
known
as
the
isentropic
work
of
compression,
can
be
calculated
from
the
operating
temperatures
right.
Effect
of
pressure
drops
in
actual
reciprocating
compressors
pressure
drop
takes
place
due
to
resistance
to
the
flow
of
the
fluid.
Pressure
drop
across
the
suction
valve
is
called
the
wire
drawing.
This
pressure
drop
can
have
adverse
effect
on
the
compressor
performance,
as
the
suction
pressure
at
the
inlet
to
the
compressor ,
that
is,
Ps,
will
be
lower
than
the
evaporator
pressure,
right.
And
this
is
also
seen
in
this
picture,
that
is,
effects
of
suction
and
discharge
side
pressure
drops
on
PV
diagram
of
a
reciprocating
compressor ,
right.
So,
this
part
so,
this
is
Pe,
and
this
is
Pc,
right.
So,
effect
is
this
much,
and
the
suction
side
is
this
much.
So,
discharge
side,
it
is
this
much,
and
suction
side
this
is
this
much,
right.
So,
that
you
have
to
look
at
from
the
PV
diagram,
right.
Now
we
come
to
the
last
part,
that
is
the
effect
of
lubrication,
that
is,
one
of
the
prime
importance.
Effect
of
lubrication,
that
is,
leakage.
So,
in
actual
compressors
refrigerant
leakage,
losses
take
place,
between
the
cylinder
walls,
and
piston,
across
the
suction
and
discharge
valves,
and
across
oil
seal
in
open
type
of
compressors.
The
magnitude
of
these
losses
depends
on
the
design
of
the
compressor
valves,
pressure
ratio,
and
compressor
speed,
and
the
life
and
condition
of
the
compressor .
Leakage
losses
increases
as
the
pressure
ratio
increases,
compressor
speed
decreases,
and
the
life
of
compressor
increases.
Due
to
the
leakage,
some
amount
of
refrigerant
flows
out
of
the
suction
valves,
as
the
beginning
of
the
compression
stroke
and
some
amount
of
refrigerant
enters
the
cylinder
through
the
discharge
valve
at
the
beginning
of
the
suction
stroke.
The
net
effect
is
to
reduce
the
mass
flow
rate
of
refrigerant,
even
though
it
is
possibly,
to
minimize
refrigerant
leakage
across
cylinder
valves.
Eliminating
leakages
across
valves
is
not
possible
as
it
is
not
possible
to
close
the
valves
completely ,
during
the
running
of
the
compressor .
So,
yeeta
v
actual,
we
can
say,
to
be
equal
to,
actual
volumetric
flow
rate
over
compressor
displacement
rate
and
that
is,
equal
to
actual
mass
flow
rate
over
maximum
possible
mass
flow
rate
right.
So,
by
general,
we
can
say
yeeta
v
actual
is
yeeta
v
e
theoretical
into
T
s
over
T
sc
minus
xi
L,
right,
and
we
can
say
that,
yeeta
v
T
h
is
the
theoretical
volumetric
efficiency
obtained
from
PV
diagram.
T
s
is
temperature
of
vapour
at
suction
flange
in
Kelvin,
T
sc
is
temperature
of
vapour
at
the
beginning
of
compression
in
Kelvin,
and
xi
L
is
the
leakage
loss,
the
distraction
in
percentage.
Then
yeeta
volume
or
yeeta
v
actual,
we
can
say,
it
will
be
equal
to
A
minus
B
into
R
p
to
the
power
c,
right.
Now,
the
very
last
one,
we
go
into
that,
ok,
v
optimum
versus,
rather,
divided
by
root
over
m
is
420
meter
per
second,
where,
v
optimum
is
the
optimum
velocity
of
the
refrigerant
through
the
valve
port
in
meter
per
second,
and
m
is
the
molecular
weight
of
the
refrigerant
in
kg
per
kg
mole.
This
relation
suggests
that
the
higher
the
molecular
rate
of
the
refrigerant
lower
is
the
optimum
refrigerant
velocity.
Let
us
come
to
lubrication,
there
can
be
reciprocating
compressors
required
lubrication
to
reduce
wire
between
several
parts
which
rub
against
each
other.
…(37)
During
the
operation,
normally,
lubricating
oil
is
used
to
lubricate
the
compressors.
The
lubricating
oil
usually
comes
in
contact
with
the
refrigerant
and
mixes
with
it.
Hence,
it
is
essential
to
select
suitable
oil
in
refrigerant
compressors.
The
important
properties
that
must
be
considered,
while
selecting
lubricating
oil
in
refrigerant
compressors
are
chemical
stability,
then
chemical
stability,
then
pour
and
or
flock
points,
dielectric
strength
and
viscosity.
So,
by
this,
we
complete
the
compressor
reciprocating,
right.
…(38)
Perhaps,
we
can
show
in
this
class,
thank
you.
There
are
so
many
right.
So,
we
complete
because,
our
time
is
over,
and
whatever
is
left,
with
reciprocating,
if
there
be
a
little.
So,
I
have
shown
you
the
slides
you
can
just
look
at
if
possible.
I
hope
you
know
how
to
do
that
and
please
look
into
at
next,
we
will
go
for
the
other
compressors,
right
and
then
condenser,
expansion
device,
and
evaporator.
Of
course,
the
evaporator
and
condenser
both
are
heat
exchangers.
So,
though
they
are
not
same,
but
as
much
as
we
can
cover,
we
will
look
into
it.
Thank
you
so
much.
