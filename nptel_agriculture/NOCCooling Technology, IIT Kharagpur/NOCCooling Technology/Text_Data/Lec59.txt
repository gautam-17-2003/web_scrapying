Good
morning,
my
dear
students
and
friends.
W e
are
at
the
really
fag
end
of
the
course,
we
have
two
more
classes,
and
as
I
said
earlier
that
we
have
said
about,
why
we
need
cooling,
we
have
said
how
to
produce
cooling,
now
we
are
on
the
application
of
the
use
of
cooling,
right,
and
as
I
said
earlier
that
my
favorite
is
ice
cream,
because
I
worked
also
in
ice
cream
industry .
So,
these
two
classes
will
be
with
ice
cream.
Now ,
in
ice
cream
production,
you
need
refrigeration,
in
ice
cream
storage
you
need
refrigeration,
in
ice
cream
transportation,
you
need
refrigeration,
that
is
why
it
is
pertinent.
It
is
not
that
it
is
out
of
the
course
or
outside
of
the
course,
but
yes
as
an
application,
I
would
like
to
share
my
experience
with
you
in
ice
cream,
ok.
Now ,
first
thing
which
we
need
to
know
that,
why
ice
cream
is
so,
of
course,
popular ,
the
reason
being
ice
cream
is
very
very
popular
all
over ,
not
India
all
over
the
world.
I
am
not
going
to
that
statistics,
that
in
India
per
capita
consumption
is
much
below
than
that
for
the
developed
country
people,
their
consumption
is
much
much
higher
than,
of
course,
that
of
India,
and
I
do
not
know ,
I
am
just
joking,
that
may
be
one
of
the
reasons,
why
they
are
so
fatty
right.
And
most
of
the
developed
country’ s
people,
you
nowadays
see
that,
their
fundamental
problem
is
obesity ,
one
of
the,
right.
However ,
that
is
dif ferent.
Now ,
we
come
to
the
manufacturing
of
ice
cream
or
some
information,
which
is
relevant,
that
is
ice
cream,
what
it
is
made
of?
right.
It
is
made
of
milk
fat,
generally ,
10
to
12
percent,
but,
nowadays,
either
fat
free
or
very
less
fat
ice
cream
is
also
available.
As
I
just
said
that,
people
have
become
very
much
concerned
about
the
obesity ,
and
other
things.
So,
the
fat
content
in
that
is
also
reduced
right,
but
by
and
lar ge,
as
of
now ,
in
India,
it
is
around
10
to
12
percent,
except,
where
it
is
specifically
written
that
low
calorie,
low
fat
ice
cream
right.
So,
then
milk
solid
not
fat,
right.
If
you
separate
milk
fat
from
the
remaining
if
you
separate
milk
fat,
from
the
remaining
milk,
that
is
if
it
is
dried,
then
that
is
called
milk
solid
not
fat,
right,
where
all
other
than
fat,
like
protein,
carbohydrate,
vitamins,
minerals
everything
are
present.
So,
that
is
called
milk
solid
not
fat.
Sugar
usually ,
we
get,
sugar
everybody
we
consume
sugar .
So,
that
is
around
0.2
sorry ,
14
to
16
percent
and
milk
solid
not
fat
is
1 1
to
13
percent.
Stabilizers
and
emulsifiers,
these
two
are
required
because,
if
you
try
at
home,
take
in
onecup
water
and
little
drops
of
oil
and
if
you
want
to
mix
them
you
will
see,
you
cannot
mix
them,
whatever
try
you
do,
you
just
cannot
mix
them,
right.
So,
that
is
why ,
the
stabilizer
and
emulsifiers
are
needed
because,
milk
fat
which,
we
have
said,
has
to
be
stabilized,
by
stabilizer
and
emulsifiers,
remaining
is
water .
So,
that
has
to
mix
with
the
water
and
get
it
stable.
So,
that
is
done
by
both
emulsifier
and
stabilizer ,
when
we
say
about
the
usefulness
of
these,
then
will
come
in
detail.
So,
stabilizers
and
emulsifiers
are
used
around
0.2
to
0.3
percent
and
over
0.1
to
0.2
percent,
respectively .
W ater
and
air ,
you
see,
you
add
all
these,
it
comes
somewhere
around
60
to
64
percent,
or
rather ,
the
other
way
round,
it
is
around
36
to
40
percent,
right,
if
you
add
rest
of
the
things,
which
are
above
it.
So,
they
are
36
to
40
percent.
So,
water
required
is
60
to
64
percent
and
air
is
90
to
105
percent.
This
I
will
tell
separately ,
why
it
is
90
to
105
percent,
right
and
some
flavor
and
color
are
also
added
to
it.
Then
what
do
these
constituents
do?
Right.
Milk
fat,
which
we
said
10
to
12
percent,
out
of
which,
80
percent
is
fat.
So,
it
may
come
from
the
source
as
cream,
or
butter .
Y ou
know ,
the
butter ,
which
you
take
every
day
at
home
with
bread
and
many
other
things.
So,
that
butter
contains
around
83
percent
of
fat,
right,
and
around
roughly ,
12
to
13
percent,
or
I
should
not
say
83
percent,
that
is
why
I
said
it
around.
So,
it
is
81
to
83
percent,
and
water
is
also
around
17
percent
and
a
little
salt
is
also
given,
that
is
why
butter
is
salty ,
if
you
the
taste,
butter
is
salty
because
salt
is
also
given
there
right.
So,
the
source
being
either
cream
or
butter
obviously ,
butter
price
is
more
than
cream,
because
butter
is
a
processed
product.
So,
obviously ,
processing
char ge
will
be
added.
If
you
take
cream,
then
that
is
not
there,
right.
Then,
the
purpose
of
using
milk
fat
is,
it
improves
flavor ,
produces
characteristic
smooth
texture,
and
the
disadvantage
associated
with
it
is
that,
it
retards
rate
of
whipping
and
it
is
also
high
in
calorie
and
cholesterol.
Now ,
again
our
new
term
has
come,
that
is
whipping.
I
hope
you
have
seen
at
home
your
mummy
or
seniors
or
yourself
doing
omelet,
right
breaking
the
egg,
putting
in
some
container ,
maybe
glass
or
cup
wherever
and
with
a
spoon
you
are
continuously
stirring,
like
this
right.
Why
you
are
stirring?
If
you
ever
measure
in
a
cylinder ,
if
you
have
broken
that
egg,
take
the
volume,
that
may
be
this
much,
then
you
pour
in
that
cup
or
wherever
you
can
and
then
you
do,
this
is
called
whipping,
right.
That
stirring,
which
you
are
doing
is
called
whipping,
the
purpose
is
to
incorporate
air .
Now ,
you
see
the
volume
in
the
cylinder ,
you
will
see
the
volume
has
gone
up
much
more
than
previous
one.
So,
this
is
called
whipping
right.
So,
it
retards,
we
have,
in
the
previous
slide,
we
have
shown
you
that,
ice
cream
contains
around
90
to
105
percent
of
air .
So,
if
air
is
notincorporated,
right,
properly ,
then
you
do
not
get
the
ice
cream.
Many
people
do
say ,
we
have
prepared
ice
cream,
but
I
always
say
that,
you
have
not
prepared
ice
cream,
because,
I,
unless,
you
have
an
ice
cream
freezer
itself,
you
cannot
do
the
ice
cream
at
home,
because,
what
you
do
is
more
or
less
similar
to
cool
fee,
cool
fee
has
very
high
solid
content,
right,
very
low
air
very
very
low
air .
So,
cool
fee
you
can
make,
but
not
the
ice
cream,
because
ice
cream
you
have
to
have
that
90
to
105
percent
of
air ,
which
you
cannot
do
at
home.
Whatever
whipping
you
do,
it
will
not
be,
you
will
do
whipping
during,
before
making
the
ice
cream,
right.
So,
then
you
will
keep
it
somewhere
for
freezing
etc.
there,
no
air
will
be
incorporated.
So,
it
is
very ,
it
is
not
possible,
rather ,
I
should
say ,
to
make
ice
cream
at
home.
However ,
the
second
ingredient
is
milk
solid
not
fat.
It
is
around
1 1
to
13
percent.
Obviously ,
the
sources
are
protein,
lactose,
it
contains
protein
lactose
and
minerals,
all
put
together
milk
solid
not
fat,
itself
is
a
source,
and
it
is
coming
from
the
milk
solids
as
purpose
is
to
provide
food
value,
because
you
are
adding
protein,
you
are
adding
lactose,
you
are
adding
minerals.
So,
this
adds
the
food
value,
improves
palatability ,
I
hope
you
have
taken
milk
powder
just
like
that,
right
and
you
have
tasted
it
nicely .
There,
it
is
also
with
fat,
but
without
fat
also,
you
see
baby
food,
right.
I
hope,
everybody ,
when
a
baby
is
being
born
or
has
born,
everybody ,
who,
say
mother ,
father ,
grandfather
everybody ,
they
would
like
to
have
some
scoop
of
that
baby
food
because,
it
is
palatable.
So,
it
is
increasing
palatability ,
and
also
texture,
but
it
has
some
disadvantages
that,
it
resists
melting.
Now
you
assume,
I
hope
you
know
the
candies,
right
if
you
put
a
candy
in
your
mouth,
you,
what
you
do?
you
take
from
this
side
to
that
side
and
gradually
it
gets
dissolved
over
a
long
period
of
time,
but
you,
as
you
just
imagine
that,
you
have
taken
a
scoop
of
ice
cream,
put
it
in
your
mouth,
and
you
are
not
able
to
melt
it.
How
do
you
feel?
it
is
simply
like
a
candy ,
but
that
is
not
desirable,
what
is
desirable,
you
put
in
your
mouth,
the
warmth
of
the
mouth,
that
will
cause
the
ice
cream
to
melt,
and
then
you
enjoy
the
ice
cream,
that
is
what.
So,
if
it
is
resistant
in
melting,
it
is
not
desirable,
that
is
why
disadvantage,
right,
but,
somewhere,
it
is
also
advantageous.
I
will
come
afterwards,
because
other
is,
it
will
be
repeating.
It
lowers
freezing
point
that
is
also
disadvantage,
because
the
moment
freezing
point
is
going
down,
means
more
ener gy
you
have
to
extract.
So,
more
cooling
you
have
to
produce.
So,
that
is
another
disadvantage,
and
it
causes
salty ,
and
taste,
salty
taste,
and
maybe
it
is
causing
some
sandiness,
right.
It
is
sandy ,
salty ,
because,
milk
solid
not
fat
contains
minerals.
So,
that
may
cause
the
salty
taste.
Sugar ,
close
is
14
to
16
percent,
source
obviously ,
sugar .
Purpose
is
to
make
ice
cream
sweet,
and
it
improves
the
texture
and
flavour
verygood,
but
it
also
has
some
disadvantage,
that
it
also
lowers
whipping.
W e
have
already
said
whipping
time
and
lowers
the
hardening
temperature,
again,
if
you
are
to
harden
it,
say
at
minus
30
o
C,
if
it
is
lowering,
and
that
lowering
is,
why
because
of
again,
your
earlier
also,
we
said
that
the
law ,
which
is
lowering
down
the
temperature
or
increasing
the
temperature,
that
is
called
Raoult's
law ,
right.
Lowering
the
hardening
temperature
is
again
incorporating
some
additional
cost.
Emulsifiers,
it
is
around
0.2
percent
maximum,
generally
by
mono
or
diglyceride
is
the
source,
its
purpose
is
to
increase
whipping
quality ,
and
it
gives
drier
and
smoother
ice
cream,
and
also
it
distributes
air
cells
uniformly ,
that
is
what
is
required.
It
should
not
be
that,
in
a
ice
cream,
say
this
is
the
ice
cream
scoop,
you
have
taken
out,
of
which,
you
have
a
air
bubble,
here
and
another
air
big
bubble
here,
a
small
air
bubble
here,
that
is
not
desirable,
it
should
have
uniform
distribution
of
the
air
bubbles,
or
air
in
the
ice
cream
itself,
right.
So,
these
are
disadvantages.
Then
emulsifier
is
maximum
0.2
percent.
Generally ,
by
mono
and
diglycerides
are
used.
This
use
is
that,
it
increases
whipping
quality
again,
so
that,
which
were
against
whipping,
now ,
counteracted
by
this,
both,
emulsifier
and
stabilizer ,
right.
So,
increases
whipping
quality
gives
drier
and
smoother
ice
cream,
distributes
air
cells
also
uniformly ,
right.
So,
this
we
have
already
said,
if
it
is
exceeded,
then
that
causes
slow
melting
and
texture
defects,
that
is
not
again
desirable.
Stabilizers,
0.2
to
0.3
percent
by
sodium
alginate
and
and
gelatin,
agar
and
agar ,
all
these
are
used
obviously ,
purpose
is
to
prevent
coarsening.
Now ,
since
again
another
term
has
come
up
coarsening,
what
we
mean
that?
In
the
ice
cream,
your
ice
crystal
size
is
this,
we
said
9
–
1 1,
increasing
right.
So,
that
9
-
1 1
has
happened,
and
we
also
said
that,
at
the
ice
crystal,
already
formed
and
surrounding
water
molecule,
if
they
find
that,
it
is
not
ener gy ,
in
terms
of
requirements,
it
is
not
possible,
then
they
will
go
and
add
up
to
that
right.
Now ,
while
you
are
storing
it
in
a,
in
a
hard,
in
a
that
distribution
box,
or
that
exhibition
box
or
not
display
box,
I
should
say
right.
So,
there
your
ice
cream
is
there,
for
some
reason,
the
temperature
got
closed,
means
supply
of
these
are
also
with
vapour
compression
refrigeration
that
cooling
around
minus
20
degree
centigrade
is
done.
But
if
by
chance
there
is
no,
if
by
chance
there
is
no
electricity ,
for
long
time,
then
what
will
happen?
this
9
–
1 1,
again
will
be
converted
back
to
9.
So,
it
will
remain
there,
say
again,
when
the
thing
will
come,
earlier
the
size
of
the
ice
crystal
was
this,
now
the
ice
crystal
went
up,
that
is
what
is
coarsening
right.
So,
that
is
not
desirable,
because
you
do
not
like
bigger
ice
crystals
in
your
mouth,
that
will
become
like
candy
and
disadvantages,
it
causes
heavy
and
soggy
body ,
and
also
it
resists
melting,not
desirable.
W ater ,
around
60
to
64
percent,
air
90
to
95
percent
respectively ,
are
used.
Obviously ,
it
increases
the
volume,
disadvantages,
that
increase
the
transportation,
cost
of
storage,
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
say
that,
you
know
Gujarat
is
famous
for
milk
or
white
revolution,
right.
Now ,
if
milk
contains
roughly
90
percent
water
and
10
percent
remaining
roughly ,
right,
with
the
source
etc.
it
varies
widely .
Now ,
what
you
are
doing,
for
say
1000
kg
or
1000
litre
of
milk
transporting
from
Gujarat
to
say
Delhi,
out
of
which
90
percent,
that
means
900
liters
is
water
getting
transported,
and
the
other ,
that
is
10
percent
is
100
litre
or
kg
whatever ,
right.
Now ,
if
you
can,
if
you
can
remove
this
900
litre
or
minimize
say
450,
or
say
200
liters,
or
even
lower ,
then
your
cost
of
transportation
will
go
drastically
down,
right.
T ill
now ,
it
is
not
being
done.
W e
are
transporting
the
whole
thing,
and
that
is
why
the
transportation
cost
being
so
high,
the
milk
price
is
going
up
right.
So,
if
we
can
do
that,
that
is
one
of
the
remedy
for
increase
of
the
price.
Similarly ,
you
are
putting
90
to
100
percent,
that
is
say ,
50
percent
ice
cream,
and
50
percent
air .
So,
volume
is
increasing,
weight
is
less,
but
volume
is
increasing,
so
your
per
unit
transportation,
your
less
quantity
of
material
is
moving,
that
is
increasing
the
cost
ok.
Then,
flavour
and
colour ,
flavour
is
normally
used
by
fruits
and
nuts
and
permitted
artificial
flavours
obviously ,
this
will
be,
I
mean,
this
will
be
selected
by
the
company .
So,
normally ,
they
do
not
divulge
it
to
others,
its
purpose
is
to
increase
the
acceptability ,
but
disadvantage
is
harsh
flavour
reduce
acceptability
and
intense
flavour
satisfy
the
desire
very
quickly .
Y ou
will
see
if
you
consume
some
high
flavour
material
anywhere,
then
your
satiety
is
almost
over .
So,
you
will
not
be
able
to
consume
more
quantity
of
things
because
you
have
already
gotten
the
taste
and
flavour .
Colour ,
it
is
also
secret
of
the
company .
Normally ,
permitted
food
colours
are
used
and
it
improves
acceptability ,
as
see,
and
it
aids
in
identifying
flavor ,
say ,
tutti
frutti,
and
in
a
cold
room,
where
you
have
such
a
big
thing.
So,
here
maybe
some
quantity
of
ice
cream,
here
maybe
some
quantity
of
ice
cream,
like
that
it
is
distributed.
Now ,
the
fellow ,
by
opening
the
door ,
who
will
be
either
keeping
or
taking
out.
So,
he
has
to
know ,
what
is
where,
right,
from
the
packet,
if
you
hopefully
you,
have
seen,
from
the
packet
you
cannot
identify .
So
that
colour
helps
to
identify
the
product
itself
right.
So,
if
it
is
that,
the
process
flowchart,
we
can
say ,
like
this,
quickly ,
that
solid
raw
materials
are
first
received
at
one
place
from
there
it
is
manually
or
with
the
help
of
some
automatic
system,
it
is
mixed,
then
it
is
pasteurised
and
after
pasteurization,
it
is
homogenized.
Why?
because
the
ice
cream
contains
uniform
fat
size.
So,
that
is
why ,
it
is
homogenized,
then
it
is
chilled,
after
chilling
it
is
aged,
ageing
is
done
at
4
degree
centigrade
for
couple
of
hours,
4
to
6
hours,
then
flavour
and
colour
materials
are
added,
then
it
is
taken
to
freezer
for
freezing,
where
fruits
and
nuts
can
be
also
added,
then
it
ispacked
either
individual
or
bulk
packing,
goes
to
hardening
room
because,
the
ice
cream,
which
comes
out
from
here,
is
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade.
So,
it
is
semi
solid,
it
is
having
flow
ability .
T o
restrict
that
hardening
room
is
required,
for
hardening,
and
then
it
goes
to
cold
room
and
further
it
is
going
to
the
distribution
market.
So,
this
is
how
the
flowchart
is.
W e
can
say
of
ice
cream
manufacturing.
Now
quickly
if
we
look
at
the
this
is
the
layout
right
this
is
the
plant
lead
we
can
say ,
this
is
a
plant
layout
how
the
machines
and
all
other
things
are.
T ypically ,
we
call
it
to
be
plant
layout,
right
for
ice
cream
manufacturing,
where
I
used
to
work.
This
was
at
like
Dr .
A.
B.
Road
or
in
W orli,
at
Bombay
right
ok.
Then,
we
come
to
the
ice
cream,
if
you
take,
take
one
section,
and
this
is
taken
from
the
book
called,
Aurbuckle,
right
this
is
taken
from
the
book
called
Aurbuckle.
it
is
taken,
this
book
is
taken
as
one
of
the
bible
of
ice
cream
manufacturing
right.
Here
you
see
A
B
C
these
are
all
dimensions
and
distributions
of
air
cells,
and
ice
crystals,
sizes
of
the
ice
crystals
etc.
right.
Then,
we
go
to
the
how
it
is
made?
The
making
parameters
are
first,
it
is
pasteurized,
70
degree
centigrade
for
30
minute,
this
is
the
prime
thing,
because
normally ,
milk
is
pasteurized
at
63
degree
centigrade
for
30
minutes,
right.
Then,
it
is
homogenized,
it
is
done
by
two
stage
homogenization,
2500
and
500
psig,
why
we
are
saying,
because,
this
is
the
whole
number ,
if
we
convert
it
into
atmosphere
or
any
other ,
it
may
not
be
a
whole
number ,
or
decimal,
that
is
why
it
is
easy
to
remember ,
right.
Then,
it
is
chilled,
chilling
is
done
again
by
ethylene
glycol
in
a
heat
exchanger ,
ethylene
glycol
and
water
mixture,
as
a
secondary
refrigerant,
primary
can
be
either
ammonia,
Freon
etc.
right.
Ageing,
again
it
is
done
by
Freon
refrigerated
vat
and
it
is
aged
for
4
hour ,
why ,
because
it
improves
the,
it
improves
the
viscosity ,
right.
Otherwise,
when
I
will
show ,
the
ice
cream
freezer .
So,
if
the
viscosity
is
high,
then,
what
will
happen?
It
will
flow
very
fast,
you
want
to
retain
it
in
the
ice
cream
for
some
time.
So,
that
the
necessary
cooling
is
done
so,
for
which
the
viscosity
has
to
be
increased,
that
is
done
here.
Freezing
is
done
with
the
ice
cream
freezer
available
in
the
market,
around
300
to
700
liters
per
hour
capacity ,
or
any
other ,
it
is,
but
the
outcome
is
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
because
it
is
flowable.
Then
it
is
filled
either
manually
or
automatically
in
some
packaging
systems,
then,
goes
to
hardening
room
where
air
at
minus
40
degree
centigrade
is
blown
over
it
and
the
temperature
could
be
minus
30
around.
So,
it
takes,
depending
on
the
size,
shape
etc.
2
to
8
hours
for
hardening.
Then
it
goes
to
cold
room
obviously ,
cold
room
is
around
minus
18
or
below ,
typically ,
say
minus
25
o
C,
cold
room
is
also
refrigerated
with
either
ammonia
or
Freon.
Then,
it
goes
to
dispatch,
where
lot
many
possible
way ,
which
will
come
in
the
next
class,
possible
way
it
is
dispatched,
right.Dry
ice
pad,
pad
van,
then
mechanical
refrigerated
vans,
etc.
are
used
for
transporting
frozen
ice
cream,
right.
Now ,
our
time
is
up.
So,
we
stop
our
this
class
here
itself.
Thank
you
for
listening.
