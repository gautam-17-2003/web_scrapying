So,
good
afternoon.
I
am
so
happy ,
by
this
time,
that
you
have
done
a
lot
of
problems,
at
home
and
perhaps
today ,
we
will
conclude
on
psychrometrics
solving
some
more
problems.
If
you
have
any
problem,
if
you
have
come
across
with
any
problem,
you
are
free
to
ask
in
your
forum,
right
and
you
will
be
given
the
right
kind
of
directions
or
answers.
So,
we
have
done
more
or
less
everything
about
psychrometrics.
Now
we
are
solving
problem,
one
problem
we
have
thoroughly
solved.
Now
we
will
do
some
more
problems, in the continuation class of the psychrometrics right.
Now ,
if
we
look
at,
this
was
our
psychrometric
chart,
and
we
said
that
this
was
the
problem,
this
problem,
we
have
solved.
Next
problem,
let
us
take
and
this
problem
is
saying
that,
air
in
a
house
has
a
wet
bulb
temperature
of
54
degree
centigrade,
and
a
dry
bulb
temperature
of
71
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
determine
the
humidity ,
number
1,
number
2,
the
dew
point
and
number
3,
the
percentage
relative
humidity
right.
I
repeat,
so
in
a
house,
air
has
a
wet
bulb
temperature
of
54
degree
centigrade
and
a
dry
bulb
temperature of 71 degree centigrade.
We
have
to
determine,
the
humidity ,
that
is
humidity
ratio,
or
absolute
humidity ,
the
dew
point,
and
the
percentage
relative
humidity
right.
So,
this,
we
can
do
here,
first
and
then
in
the
chart,
then
it
becomes
complete.
First
let
us
do
that
drawing
of
the
psychrometric
chart,
sorry ,
drawing
of
the
psychrometric
chart.
So,
this
is
our
psychrometric
chart
right.
Now , whatever we have been given, that we have to find out.
We
are
given
wet
bulb
temperature
of
54
and
dry
bulb
temperature
of
71.
So,
obviously ,
this
temperature
scale,
we
have
this,
both
54
and
71,
present
otherwise
you
cannot
do.
So,
at
least
it
has
to
be
between
50
to
80
right.
So,
if
we
do
first,
our
thing
is
given,
54
degree as wet bulb temperature.  So, Wb is equal  to 54 and Db, dry bulb is 71.
So,
let
us
take
this
point
to
be
71,
this
is
54
and
this
is
71.
So
two
temperatures,
we
have
located
right,
sorry ,
we
have
written
here,
it
will
be
difficult.
So
we
should
not
write
here
ok.
Now ,
if
we
are
given
that,
this
is
51,
this
is
70,
54
and
71,
54
have
been
given
as
wet  bulb temperature right.  So, 71 as dry bulb temperature.So,
we
can
straight
way
go
vertical.
So,
this
is
the
71
degree
line
and
wet
bulb
is
54.
So
54
we
have
identified.
Now ,
we
go
to
the
saturation
line,
right,
and
in
that
saturation
line,if
we
go
along
the
x
axis,
the
point,
where,
it
is
intersecting,
is
the
state
point.
Why
we
are
going
along
the
x
axis,
because
if
you
remember ,
when
we
had
said
about
the
wet
bulb line, or wet bulb temperature, no, I am mistaken, sorry , I am mistaken.
Then,
what
we
did?
We
need
to
do,
I
am
mistaken,
sorry ,
the
mistake
is
here,
that
this
was
our
line,
this
is
our
line,
this
is
our
54
and
this
is
our
71,
and
we
went
along
the
vertical
71,
and
from
54,
we
went
vertical
up
to
the
saturation
line,
right.
Now ,
I
was
mistaken,
where
I
went
along
the
x
axis
that
is
constant
humidity
line,
but
we
are
not
said
that
what
we
were
said
that
the
wet
bulb.
So
wet
bulb
means
we
have
to
go
along
the
wet
bulb
line.
So
from
here
we
draw
the
wet
bulb
line
right
and
the
point
where
it
is
intersecting
is
the
state
point.
So,
state
point
1
is
where
dry
bulb
equal
to
71,
wet
bulb
is
equal to 54 right.
We
have
been
asked
to
find
out,
humidity ,
that
is
absolute
humidity ,
if
we
go
along
this
will
be
absolute
humidity ,
right
in
kg
water
per
kg
dry
air,
say
it
will
have
a
value
of
0.1
say.
So,
absolute
humidity
H
is
equal
to
0.1
and
we
are
asked
to
do
dew
point.
So
along
the
absolute
humidity
line,
if
we
proceed
and
go
along
this
line,
should
be
here,
ok,
otherwise, we will not be, sorry .
So
this
line
will
be
here.
So,
along
this
line,
it
will
be
this.
So
here,
coming
across
with
the
saturation
line
and
from
there
we
are
coming
down
vertically
to
the
intersection
of
x
axis,
and
that
is
giving
us
the
dew
point
right.
Obviously ,
dew
point
is
less
than
54
wet
bulb
temperature.
Now ,
how
much
less,
that
we
can
only
know
once
we
have
the
perfect
scale
and
the
chart,
psychometric
chart,
but
the
process
is
like
this
and
then
we
are
asked
to find out percentage relative  humidity .
Now ,
this
was
100
percent,
then
maybe
50
percent,
then
maybe
40
percent,
maybe
30
percent,
or
it
could
be
somewhere
20
percent,
right.
So
RH
maybe,
could
be
20
percent.
So,
what
we
get
from
this
problem
that
out
of
7,
at
least
5
properties,
either
given
or
found
out,
right
either
given,
or
we
could
find
out
that,
what
are
the
property
values
right.
So
property
values,
which
we
were
given
are
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature,
and
we
were
asked
to
find
out
relative
humidity ,
absolute
humidity ,
and
dew
point.
So,
these
we
have
done, hopefully you also have done.
Now ,
let
us
go
back
to
the
actual
scale,
as
I
am
again
saying,
the
one,
which
I
have,
maybe
that
one
is
in
Fahrenheit,
but
whatever
be
let
us
look
into
that
in
actual
scale
right.
So
here
we
are,
we
have
said
that,
we
have
a
54
degree
centigrade
wet
bulb
temperature.So,
54
is
somewhere
here
right
is
54
is
somewhere
here.
Then
we
go
vertical
to
the
saturation
line
and
71,
say
here
71
is
here.
So
we
go
vertical,
may
not
be
up
to
the
saturation required, right up to the saturation line may  not be required.
Then,
we
have
to
come
down
along
the
wet
bulb
line.
So,
this
is
the
wet
bulb
line.
So,
this
is
also
a
wet
bulb
line.
So,
parallel
to
that,
this
is
the
intersection
and
that
is
the
state
point
1,
right.
From
this
intersection,
and
state
point
1
along
this
x
axis,
we
got
absolute
humidity
here
the
value
is
somewhere
30,
if
I
am
not
mistaken,
and
we
are
asked
to
find
out dew point.
So
in
the
x
axis,
we
come
and
then,
do
the
vertical,
and
that
vertical
comes
to
somewhere
near
to
25
right.
So
here,
it
is
30,
here
it
is
25,
and
we
have
to
find
out
the
intersection
of
this
and
the
relative
humidity
line
will
be,
this
is
also
written.
Let
me
wipe
it
off.
So
that
relative
humidity ,
we
can
find
out,
yes,
this
is
somewhere
30
percent
relative
humidity
right.
So
this
way
we
can
determine
the
values,
given
the
actual
situation right.
Now ,
let
us
do
few
more
problems
quickly
and
if
you
practice
it,
at
home,
then
it
will
be
very
easy.
For
you,
this
one
we
have
done,
right
this
one
we
have
done
just
now.
Then
next
one
is
from
some
more
information
are
required
to
be
shared
what
is
that?
Now ,
obviously ,
as
you
see
that
this
is
not
according
to
the
scale,
or
the
diagram
we
use
like,
we
use
like
this,
that
this
is
the
actual
way
of
presenting
the
psychometric
chart
right.
But
here
we
are
not
doing,
it
is
in
a
say
square,
or
rectangular
thing,
but
we
assumed
it
to
be
a
absolute
humidity
line,
right
and
this
is
the
scale
or
thing
which
we
are
talking
about
like this.  So, some more and that is, what it is the 100 percent relative humidity .
So,
anything
cooling
beyond
this
line,
that
is
called
sub
cooling,
beyond
the
dew
point
right.
So,
in
that,
it
goes
again,
similar
to
x
axis,
parallel
to
x
axis
right.
So,
that
is
sub
cooling,
and
one
more
information
is
that
if
you
are
doing
any
adiabatic
humidification
or
dehumidification,
humidification
dehumidification
are
very
much
required
in
stores
like
cold
stores
and
others,
where
you
need
to
use,
either
humidify
or
dehumidify ,
depending
on
your
requirement.
The
moment
you
are
doing
dehumidification,
you
are
adding
water ,
by
may
be
spray
or
many
other
ways,
or
if
you
are
dehumidifying
that
means,
you
are
taking
off
the
moisture
from
there.
The
thing
is,
which
to
be
remembered is that, both, if it is under adiabatic condition, means  there is no dq, dq is 0.
So
if
that
be
true
then
the
adiabatic
humidification
or
dehumidification,
both
follow
the
wet
bulb
line,
right.
These
are
wet
bulb
lines.
So
both
follow
wet
bulb
lines.
So,
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind.
Another
thing,
if
you
are
heating,
that
is
under
constant
humidity
line, that is what here, we  have shown this is under constant humidity line right.Similarly ,
cooling
to
the
dew
point,
that
is
also
under
constant
humidity
line,
that
we
have
shown,
we
have
found
out
earlier
also.
So
this
information
is
additional.
I
repeat,
first,
let
me
clear
the
board.
This
information
is
very
much
essential,
that
when
you
are
going
beyond,
when
you
are
going
beyond
dew
point,
or
saturation
line,
that
time
cooling
below
the
dew
point
is
parallel
to
the
x
axis,
that
is
almost
in
the
constant
humidification,
constant
absolute
humidity
line
right.
Then
you
also
have
done
many
times that cooling to the dew point, that is also under constant  humidity line right.
Third
one
is,
heating,
when
you
are
heating,
that
is
also
going
under
constant
humidity
line,
but,
if
you
are
doing
adiabatic
humidification
or
dehumidification,
I
have
already
said
what
do
we
mean
by
humidification
or
dehumidification.
Humidification
meaning
you
are
externally
adding
moisture,
maybe
by
spray
or
by
some
other
means,
or
dehumidification
means,
you
are
taking
away
moisture
from
that.
So
in
either
of
the
cases,
humidification
or
dehumidification,
if
it
is
under
adiabatic
condition,
then,
it
follows
wet
bulb
line
right.
So
with
this
additional
information
let
us
proceed
to
the
next
problem
and
that
is
saying
that,
ambient,
this
is
the
perhaps
last
problem,
we
will
be
solving,
rest
you
do
yourself.
You
practice,
as
much
as
you
can,
all
information,
we
have, shared, with you and hopefully , you  can do it very nicely .
Ambient
air
at
25
degree
centigrade
and
50
percent
RH,
is
heated
to
175
degree
centigrade
determine,
the
percent
relative
humidity ,
the
wet
bulb
temperature
of
the
heated
air.
I
repeat,
ambient
air
at
25
degree
centigrade,
and
50
percent
RH
is
heated
to
175
degree
centigrade.
Then,
the
percent
relative
humidity ,
and
the
wet
bulb
temperature,
if
we
do
quickly ,
maybe
one
more
problem,
we
can
solve,
that
we
have
this
ok.
Now ,
what
we
are
given,
we
are
given
25
degree
centigrade,
that
means
dry
bulb
temperature
is
25,
sorry ,
not
this
one,
dry
bulb
temperature
is
25
degree
centigrade
right.
So, if dry bulb is 25 degree centigrade, and 50 percent RH.
So
RH
line
is
this,
so
this
is
50
percent
RH.
So,
they
have
the
intersection,
at
this
point,
so,
this
is
the
state
point
1.
Now ,
from
here,
it
is
said
that
it
is
heated
to
175
degree
centigrade,
say
this
is
the
175
dry
bulb
line
right.
So,
this
is
another
state
point,
that
is
state
point
2,
this
was
state
point
1,
and
this
is
state
point
2
right.
Now ,
we
are
asked,
from the state point 2, you find out percent relative humidity , and wet  bulb temperature.
Obviously ,
percent
relative
humidity
we
can
find
out,
parallel
to
these
lines,
and
where,
it
will
be
cutting,
that
will
be
the
relative
humidity ,
and
it
appears,
if
it
is,so
far
it
could
be
around
10
percent
relative
humidity .
Then
the
second
one
is
remaining,
that
is,
wet
bulb
temperature
of
the
heated
air.
So,
wet
bulb
temperature
means,
we
will
be
going
along
the
wet
bulb
line,
right.
This
is
of
course,
very
very
high
angle,
it
has
come
up.So, if we take again a little, like this, then, we are said, 25 degree centigrade.
So
here,
25
degree
centigrade,
here,
175
degree
centigrade.
So
both
the
verticals,
right
and
we
are
asked
that
50
percent
RH.
So,
this
is
the
state
point
1,
from
there
171
degree
centigrade
is
this,
right.
Now ,
we
have
come
in
the
wet
bulb,
light
and
from
there
we
are
coming
down
to
find
out
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
So,
it
is
less
than
25,
somewhere,
depending on, what it is, right.
So,
with
this,
one
more,
if
we
can
quickly
go
through,
that
is
another
type,
that
it
is
saying
that,
room
air
at
26.7
degree
centigrade
and
50
percent
RH
is
heated
to
200
degree
centigrade
and
introduced
into
a
spray
dryer
from
which,
it
leaves
at
a
temperature
of
95
degree
centigrade
determine
the
humidity ,
and
relative
humidity
of
the
air
leaving
the
dryer .
Assume,
adiabatic
humidification
in
the
dryer ,
right
that
is
why,
I
just
wanted
to
show
you
this
problem,
that
here,
we
are
dealing
with
adiabatic,
either
humidification,
or
dehumidification.
So,
we
draw ,
sorry ,
so
we
draw
that,
our,
this
is
that,
ok.
Whatever
we
have
said,
that
26.7
degree
say,
this
is
26.7
degree,
and
50
percent
RH.
So, 50 percent RH is this, 26.7 degree is this.
So
this
is
the
state
point
1.
Then
it
is
heated
to
200
degree
centigrade.
So,
we
are
heating
it
to
this
200
degree
centigrade.
This
is
the
state
point
2,
right
and
it
is
introduced
into
a
spray
dryer ,
from
which,
it
leaves
at
a
temperature
of
95
degree
centigrade.
So,
this
is
the
95
degree
centigrade,
and
it
is
being
done
by
adiabatic
humidification.
So,
if
we, adiabatic humidification means, we know , that it will follow the wet bulb line.
So,
if
we
proceed
along
the
wet
bulb
line,
come
to
this,
right
we
have
been
asked
to
determine
humidity
and
relative
humidity
right.
So,
what
we
are
getting
that
this
95
degree
where
it
is
intersecting
from
there
we
are
getting
this
is
the
absolute
humidity ,
H
and
this
is
the
percent
relative
humidity
that
is
what
is
being
asked
for
right.
So
on
interpolation
we
can
find
out
what
is
the
relative
humidity
right.
So,
with
this
we
complete
psychrometric
and
I
hope
we
could
have
imparted
some
knowledge
to
you,
and
if
you
do
the
solutions
of
different
problems,
you
can
easily
master
the
subject
psychrometrics right.  So thank you for listening.
