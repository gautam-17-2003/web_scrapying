Psychr ometrics Contd
Good
afternoon
my
dear
students.
In
the
previous
class
we
have
been
talking
about
Psychometrics
right.
We
also
had
shown
you
a
chart
of
psychrometry .
So
today
also
we
will
continue
in
psychrometrics
because
still
some
more
are
there
and
you
need
to
learn
right.
It
is
not
that
the
chart
I
have
shown
that
is
good
enough
for
you
to
learn,
but
what
is
required
how
to
read
it?
Isn't
it?
You
are
given
a
chart
how
to
read
it,
if
you
don't
know ,
then
no
point
of
using
the
chart
right.
So,
what
I
wish
to
say
is
that
in
the
chart
we
had seen there are many lines.
So,
we
have
to
first
identify
those
lines,
right.
For
example,
you
see
in
this
slide
this
is
the
psychrometric
chart
which
we
had
shown
you
in
the
previous
class
in
a
bigger
way
right.
So,
in
this
chart,
one
thing
is
certain
that,
you
see,
the
shape
of
the,
ok,
let
it
be
white,
does
not
matter ,
the
shape
of
the
chart
is
like
this,
like
this,
and
like
this,
right.
So,
whenever
you
are
appearing
in
any
interview ,
or
in
any
other
classes,
if
you
are
asked
to
do
a
thing
for
psychrometric,
whatever
you
will
be
asked
and
if
you
are
in
the
board
or
maybe
in
pen
and
paper
then
first
thing
you
need
to
draw ,
oh,
this
cannot
be
drawn
there,  ok.
Let
me
draw
it
here,
that
first
thing
what
you
need
to
draw
is
this,
whether
small
or
big,
does
not
matter ,
but
it
has
to
be
like
this,
unless
you
have
this
boundary
diagram,
the
teacher
will
not
ask
you
any
further
question,
because,
this
boundary
diagram
is
the
indicator
of
the
psychrometric
chart
right.
So,
you
need
to
draw
this
first
and
then,
subsequently ,
whatever
questions
will
be
asked
you
have
to
answer
to
them,
but
first
thing
you
must
do
that
the
boundary
of
the
chart
you
have
to
make
right.
Next,
once
your
boundary
is
over,
then
it
comes,
how
to
draw
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
our
temperature,
our
chart
is
this,
that
we
are
supposed
to
draw
this,
ok,
then
this,
then
this,
and
finally ,
this.
So,
this
is
our
x
y
plot,
if
it
is
x
this
is
y
right.
So
dry
bulb,
as
it
is
shown
here,
I
do
not
know
whether
you
are
able
to
look
at
it
or
not,
but
we
say
that
this
is
the
temperature
axis
right
all
the
3
temperatures
we
had
told
in
the
previous
class,
that
all
the
3
temperatures
are
represented
in
this
scale,
in
this
line,
rather ,
or
axis
x
and
y
axis
is
corresponding
to,
if
you
remember ,
we
also
said
that
this
is
the
h
or
absolute
humidity
right.So,
if
we
now
draw
any,
now,
it
is
still
blank
ok.
So,
any
vertical
line
from
here
will
represent
the
temperature
axis,
any
vertical
line
here,
it,
these
are
all
vertical
lines
right,
this
is
a
vertical
line,
this
is
a
vertical
line,
this
is
a
vertical
line,
I
am
sorry ,
they
are
not
becoming
vertical
due,
because
of
drawing,
but
these
are,
this
should
be
vertical,
90
degree,
right.
So,
these
are
the
dry
bulb
temperatures,
dry
bulb
temperatures,
right.
So,
dry
bulb
temperatures
are
from
the
x
axis,
here
any
vertical
line
is
representing
dry
bulb
temperature.
Now
this
scale,
right
that
is
the
fundamental
in
psychometric
chart,
they
are
available
into
3
scales,
and
in
earlier
class
also,
I
said
here,
I
had
shown
you
one
thing
that
in
the
real
chart,
there
is
a
pressure
indicator ,
that
is
whether
it
is
for
sea
level
or
whether it is beyond sea level.
So,
corresponding
to
that
the
pressure,
sea
level
means,
it
is
atmospheric
pressure.
So,
atmospheric
pressure,
that
will
have
one
kind
of
chart
or
values
rather ,
and
chart
may
be
similar ,
but
the
values
could
be
different.
So,
once
we
know
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
then,
from
there,
in
this,
what
are
you
are
saying
that
the
scale,
the
scale
can
be
anything
it
can
be
any
temperature
you
want
right.
It
can
be
any
temperature
you
want.
Here,
at
this,
since
we
have
given
you
as
indicator ,
for
the
understanding
of
the
dry
bulb
temperature, lines.
So,
these
are
having
no
scale,
but
it
can
be,
say
0
to
50
degree
centigrade,
or
0
to
50
degree
Fahrenheit,
anything
you
want
that
can
be
that
psychometric
chart,
may
be
available
in
Fahrenheit,
or
degree
centigrade,
whatever
you
want
you
will
get,
but
the
basic
thing
remains
same.
There
is
no
change
that
is
you
will
get
the
dry
bulb
temperatures,
whether
it
is
in
centigrade
or
in
Fahrenheit.
This
(x,
x)
perpendicular
to
the
x
axis
the
lines
are
vertical
and
they
are
called
dry
bulb
temperature,
right.
So,
this
is
what
exactly
here,
what
you
are
seeing,
right.
So,
once
you
are
said
that
your
dry
bulb
temperature,
be
it
is
between
0,
sorry ,
if
it
is
between
0
degree
and
50
degree
and
your
dry
bulb
temperature
is
37
degree,
then
you
will
come,
right
maybe
this
is
35,
maybe
this
is 40.
So,
you
have
to
interpolate
and
find
out
where
is
the
37.
So,
if
it
is
37
here,
then
you
draw
the
vertical
line
and
that
is
the
dry
bulb
line,
right
or
if
it
is,
as,
we
said
0
to
50
Fahrenheit
and
if
it
is
20
Fahrenheit,
means
sub
0
in
Centigrade,
what
is
the
scale
of
Fahrenheit?
Fahrenheit
is
212
in
the
upper
side,
and
32
in
the
lower
side,
like
100
&
0
is
the
boiling
point
of
and
freezing
point
of
water
in
degree
centigrade.
Similarly ,
in
Fahrenheit,
it
is
212
&
32
Fahrenheit,
right
that
you
can
do
all
the
time
C
by
5
is
equal
to
F
minus
32
by
9.
So,
from
there
if
Fahrenheit
is
given,
you
can
get
centigrade
if
centigrade
is
given
you
can
get
Fahrenheit
right.
One
more,
one
more
simplification
is
there also c is  equal to f minus 32 divided by 9 over 5 because this 5 will go up.So,
it
will
come
down.
So,
that
can
also
be
written,
f
minus
32,
9
by
5
is
1.8.
So,
we
can
easily
find
out
what
is
the
value
of
centigrade
if
it
is
in
Fahrenheit,
like
here
it
is,
we
said
to be 20 Fahrenheit.  So, 20 minus 32 divided by 1.
8
that
is
minus
this
is
12
right,
12
by
1.8
right.
So,
how
many
it
is?
It
is
minus
minus
point 1.
8.
So,
1.8.
So,
it
is
you
put
this
120.
So,
7
18s
are
5
18s
are
90
6
18s
are
108
7
18s
are
126.
So,
it
is
6
point
something
right.
So,
we
can
easily
find
out
what
is
the
Fahrenheit
and
centigrade
temperatures
if
one
is
given
the
other ,
but
the
vertical
lines
are
the
dry
bulb
lines
right,
and
corresponding
to
this,
sorry ,
corresponding
to
this
axis,
whatever
value
is
there,
that
value
will
tell
you
whether
you
are
in
the
right
track
or
not
ok.
So,
once
we
know
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
next
is
the
wet
bulb
or
maybe
some
other
like
saturation temperature, yeah, this is saturation  temperature, right.
So,
again
what
we
do?
We
draw
that
line.
So,
this
is
our
boundary
and
this
is
our
outline.
We
have
already
found
out
the
vertical
lines
to
be
the
dry
bulb
lines
right.
Now ,
we
have
to
find
out
saturation
temperature
the
moment
saturation
temperature,
saturation
word
is
coming,
we
are
supposed
to
go
to
the
saturation
line.
Now ,
which
one
is
the
saturation line, this line is the saturation, that is 100  percent RH.
100
percent
relative
humidity
line
right,
and
all
other
lines
which
we
have
not
drawn
here,
at
the
moment,
we
can
show
you
now,
afterwards
we
will
also
do
something
else.
So,
these
all
parallel
lines
are
going
down.
So,
from
100
it
is
coming
down,
maybe
this
is
60,
maybe
this
is
40,
maybe
this
is
30,
like
that
things
are
coming
right.
So,
this
is
of
course,
we
have
done
before
and
when
relative
humidity
will
come
that
time
we
will
tell,
but
for
saturation
line,
we
had
to
show
it
right.
So,
we
have
this
line,
we
have
this
line,
and
this
saturation,
line
vertical
lines,
and
now
for
saturation,
means,
it
will
be
anywhere
in this, right, it will be anywhere in this line.
So,
how
to
go
to
that
line
there
are
horizontal
lines
also
and
these
horizontal
lines
are
intersecting
with
the
y
axis,
this
one
at
different
points,
y
axis
we
have
already
said
is
the
absolute humidity . So, it is maybe 0.001, maybe 0.1, maybe point something right 0.
3
etc.
Whatever
be
the
values.
Now ,
once
we
are
asked
to
find
out
the
saturation
line,
we
have
to
proceed
in
this
line
that
is
horizontal
lines
where
it
is
intersecting
with
the
saturation
line,
this
is
the
saturation
line,
right
where
it
is
intersecting,
that
line
we
have
to
get
and
once
we
get
that,
then,
this
is
also
here,
perhaps,
it
is
not
so
much
visible.
So,
what
we
need,
we
need
to
find
out
this
right.
So,
these
horizontal
lines
are
there
andthose
vertical
lines
are
for
dry
bulb.
So,
if
we
are
said
that
you
find
out
the
dew
point,
and
along
this
line
if
you
are
coming
to
this
point,
this
is
not
the
temperature,
this
is
the
absolute humidity line, not absolute, sorry , relative humidity line, 100 percent right.
So,
from
there,
if
you
go
down,
and
where
it
is
intersecting
with
the
x
axis
in
that
scale,
you
will
get
the
saturation
temperature.
So,
saturation
temperature,
we
are
moving
along
the
horizontal
lines,
right
parallel
to
x
axis
right.
So,
and
where
it
is
intersecting
from
there,
a
vertical
line
which
was
originally
dry
bulb,
but
now
it
is
a
saturation
temperature,
where
it
is
intersecting
with
the
x
axis
right.
So,
this
is
how
we
find
out
the
saturation
temperature,
or
saturation
line
right,
but
that
is
nothing,
but
the
parallel
to
x
axis,
that
line
we
have
to
follow ,
ok.
Then
once
we
know
the
saturation
line
then
we
have
to
find
out
relative
humidity ,
right
relative
humidity
as
we
have
already
said
that
our
diagram
is
this this, and this is the board.
Now
this
is
representing
100
percent
saturation,
right
this
was
dry
bulb
vertical,
right
these
were
horizontal
that
is
our
saturation
line
or
it
can
be
said
absolute,
it
absolute
humidity
line,
also
right.
So,
this
is
mixing
with
this,
this
one,
you
see
here,
it
is
mixing
with
the
absolute
humidity
ok.
Now
as
we
said
this
is
100
percent
relative
humidity
then
parallel
to
this
line,
sorry ,
parallel
to
this
line,
the
other
lines
are
also
like
this,
which
is
shown
here
also
this
is
the
100
percent,
here
it
is
100
percent
right,
another
parallel
line
is,
maybe
90
percent
another
parallel
line
maybe,
say
80
percent
another
parallel
line,
maybe
60
percent,
like
that
right.
So,
these
lines
are
like
that
and
accordingly
the
lines
are
drawn.
Now ,
the
question
comes,
if
it
is
100
percent
and
if
it
is
90
percent,
we
let
us
enlar ge  a little then it will be easier for understanding.
Let
us
enlar ge
a
little
then
it
will
be
easier
for
understanding
what.
So,
first
we
have
drawn
the
basic
of
the
boundary
of
the
psychrometric
chart.
So,
this
was
100
percent
relative
humidity ,
right
and
say
this
one
is
90
percent
relative
humidity .
Now ,
if
I
have
93
percent
relative
humidity
what
do
I
do
again?
You
have
to
interpolate.
So,
this
is
100
percent this is 90 percent.
So,
simple
interpolation,
right
that
is
linear
interpolation.
We
assume
here
that
the
relative
humidity
is
proceeding
with
linearity .
So,
90
percent
is
here,
100
percent
was
here.
So,
in
between
say
95
percent
that
will
be
coming
like
this
right.
See,
if
it
comes
to
91
or
99,
that
will
be
obviously ,
99
will
be
very
close
to
100
and
91
will
be
very
close
to
90 right.
So,
by
interpolation,
I
hope
interpolation
you
know ,
right
y
minus
y
1,
y
minus
y
1
divided
by
x
minus
x
1
equal
to
y
1
minus
y
2
by
x
1
minus
x
2,
perhaps
things
like
that
x
1
minus
x
2,
perhaps
this
is
the
intermediate,
one
where
y
x
is
the
intermediate,
one,and
y
2
x
2
is
extreme
one
and
y
1
x
1
is
the
other
one.
So,
if
this
point,
this
point,
are
known
the
intermediate
point
can
also
be
found
out
and
it
is
a
linear
equation
and
linearity ,
it
is
following.
So,
we
can
find
out
the
intermediate
one
and
we
can
draw
the
relative
humidity
line
by
interpolating
and
we
can
find
out
if
required
what
is
the
relative
humidity
right.
So,
after
the
relative
humidity ,
ok
Regarding
relative
humidity
another
thing
should
be
also
told
that
in
the
relative
humidity
line
when
it
is
coming,
sorry ,
when
it
is
coming
to
100
percent
then
it
is
saturated
right
100
percent,
then
it
is
saturated
line,
and
in
that
saturation
you
have
to
you
have
to
get
the
line
for
saturation
temperature
right.
So,
saturation
temperature
will
be
a
combination
on
the
relative
humidity
100
percent
line
and
dry
bulb
vertical
line
where
it
is
striking
or
where
it
is
mixing
with
the
x
axis
and
you
know
the
scale
obviously ,
this
scale
is
known
before
hand
and
whether
it
is
0
to
50
or
even
0
to
20
depending
on
what
type
of
psychrometric
chart
you
have
with
you right.
There
are
many ,
if
you
want
in
the
market,
you
will
get,
you
ask
for,
may
not
be
the
scale
you
are
looking
for
that
is
available,
but
I
am
sure
I
have
seen
in
our
institute
also
0
to
50
is
available
50
to
100
is
available
right,
0
to
100
will
be
again
a
compressed
one.
So,
the
more
it
is
expanded
the
easier
for
you
to
identify
isn't
it.
So,
if
it
is
0
to
100
scale
is
very
high
big.
So,
the
entire
thing
will
be
compressed
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
identify ,
but
if
it
is
spitted
like
0
to
20
or
20
to
50
or
0
to
50
at
least
then
that
compression
will
be
released
at
least
half
of
it
or
one
third
or
things
like
that.
So,
this
is
how the relative humidity is obtained  right.
So,
what
did
you
do
today
we
have
found
out
how
dry
bulb
temperature
can
be
identified,
how
saturation
temperature
can
be
identified
and
how
relative
humidity
can
be
identified
right.
So,
our
time
is
up
today
at
this
moment.
So,
I
thank
you
all
for
listening to the class. Thank you.
