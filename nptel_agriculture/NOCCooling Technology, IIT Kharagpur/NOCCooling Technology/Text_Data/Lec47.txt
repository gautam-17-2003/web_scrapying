COMPRESSORS
Good
afternoon
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
my
friends.
We
are
at
the
verge
of
end
of
this,
no,
this
is,
of
course,
compressor ,
but
one
compressor
which,
we
have
not
finished
that
was
screw
type
right.
So,
this
we
are
calling
rotary
positive
displacement
type
compressors,
right
rotary
positive
displacement
type
compressors.
There
are
many
compressors
under
this
head
right.
In
the
beginning
of
compressor ,
we
had
said,
there
are
many
types
of
compressors,
we
gave
more
importance
to
this,
to
and
fro,
that
is,
our,
not
centrifugal,
the
other
one,
that
was
your,
and
positive
displacement,
of
course,
and
this
was
to
and
fro
normal
compressors
which,
are
used
for
most
of
the
refrigeration
systems,
right.
So,
we
have
also
completed
the
centrifugal
type,
right,
that
is
rotary
type
centrifugal
also
we
have
completed.
Now,
we
are
left
with
the
rotary
positive
displacement
type
compressors,
right.
So,
what
we
can
say
that,
the
first
one
could
be
rolling
piston,
or
fixed
vane
type
compressors,
these
are
used
in
small
refrigeration
system
around
2
kilowatt
capacity,
that
is,
less
than
a
tonnage
of
refrigeration.
If
you
remember,
the
relation
between
tonnage
of
refrigeration
and
kilowatt.
So,
one
tonnage
of
refrigeration
was
somewhere
3.5
kilowatt.
So,
it
is
less
than
a
tonnage
of
refrigeration
capacity.
Such
as
domestic
refrigerators,
or
air
conditioners,
domestic,
of
course.
These
compressors
belong
to
the
class
of
positive
displacement
type,
as
compression
is
achieved
by
reducing
the
volume
of
the
refrigerant.
And,
in
this
type
of
compressors,
the
rotating
shaft
of
the
roller,
has
its
axis
of
rotation,
that
matches
with
the
centre
of
the
cylinder.
So,
we
can
say,
or
however,
it
is
eccentric,
with
respect
to
the
roller,
right.
I
will
show
that
in
the
next
figure.
And
this
eccentricity
of
the
shaft,
with
respect
to
the
roller,
creates
suction,
and
compression,
of
the
refrigerant,
that
is,
we
are
showing
in
the
figure.
Let
me
show
them
the
figure.
The
figure
is
like
this,
right.
This
is
the
working
principle
of
rolling
piston
type
compressors,
right.
As
you
see,
from
here
that,
the
fixed
vane
is
this,
suction
is
happening
through
this,
and
this
is
the
roller,
and
this
is
the
cylindrical
block.
Once
suction
is
over,
then
discharge
valve
is
like
that.
So,
what
is
happening
after
this
entry?
This
roll
is
moving
like
this,
right.
So,
it
is
sucking
and
compressing,
and
then,
discharging
like
this,
which
in
subsequent,
1,
2
and
3figures,
we
have
shown,
right.
Everywhere,
the
outer
casing,
that
remains
same,
here,
here,
here,
everywhere,
that
remains
same,
but,
an
inlet
also
remains
same,
exit,
also
remains
same,
but
what
we
have
done
this
roller,
that
we
have
moved
from
this
position,
to
this
position,
to
this
position,
and
you
see,
everywhere,
though
both
are
circle.
So,
circles
are
of
point
contact.
So,
it
is
taking
away
the
suction
like
this,
like
this,
and
compressing,
and
then,
it
is
going
up
to
the
outside
vane,
remaining
in
the
same
position,
that
is
the
fixed
vane,
right.
This
is
how
this
typical,
yeah
this
is
how
this
typical
rolling
piston
type
compressors
work,
right.
A
single
vane
or
blade
is
positioned
in
the
non-rotating
cylindrical
block.
The
rotating
motion
of
the
roller
causes
a
reciprocating
motion
of
the
single
vane,
right.
So,
the
other
one,
when
I
started,
I
was
not
able
to
remember
that,
memorize,
what
was
that,
positive
displacement,
and
that
was
a
reciprocating
positive
displacement
type,
right.
However,
as
we
have
seen,
from
this
figure,
the
working
principle
of
the
rolling
piston
type
compressor ,
right.
Next,
we
show,
as
it
was
seen,
in
the
figure
previously
shown,
this
type
of
compressor ,
does
not
require
a
suction
valve,
but
require
a
discharge
valve,
because,
suction,
it
is
sucking,
and
the
roller
is,
roller
is
controlling
the
sucking.
Not
only
that,
it
is
not,
it
is
not
getting
away,
right.
The
sealing
between
the
high
end
low
pressure
sides,
has
to
be
provided,
and
for
that,
along
the
line
of
contact,
between
roller
and
cylinder
block,
it
can
be,
or
along
the
line
of
contact
between
vane
and
the
roller,
or
it
should
not
be,
or
and
also
between
the
roller
and
end
plates.
So,
this
can
be
provided.
The
leakage
is
controlled
through
hydrodynamic
sealing
and
matching
between
the
matching
components,
the
effectiveness
of
the
sealing
depends
on
the
clearance,
compressor
speed,
surface
finish
and
oil
viscosity.
Closed
tolerances
and
good
surface
finishing
is
required
to
minimize
internal
leakage.
Then,
unlike
in
reciprocating
compressors,
the
small
clearance
volume,
filled
with
high
pressure
refrigerant,
does
not
expand,
but
simply
mixes
with
the
suction
refrigerant
in
the
suction
space.
As
a
result,
the
volumetric
efficiency
does
not
reduce
drastically
with
increasing
pressure
ratio.
Pressure
ratio,
earlier
also,
we
have
said,
indicating
small
re-expansion
losses.
The
compressor ,
runs
smoothly
and
is
relatively
quiet
as
the
refrigerant
flow
is
continuous.
So,
it
is
relatively
quiet,
unlike
the
reciprocating
type,
which
has
really,
I
mean,
high
noise.
The
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant,
through
the
compressor ,
that
is,
given
by
m
dot
equal
to
yeeta
v
into
V
dot
s
w
over
v
e
which
is
equal
to
yeeta
v
over
v
e
into
pi
by
4
into
N
by
60
into
A
square
minus
B
square
into
capital
L.
Then
we
must
tell,
what
is
what,
because,
so
many
nomenclatures,
we
have
used,
or
not
nomenclatures,
so
many,
somany
A,
B,
N,
all
these
we
have
used.
So,
these
characters
must
be
explained.
So,
A
is
the
inner
diameter
of
the
cylinder,
B
is
the
diameter
of
the
roller,
L
is
the
length
of
the
cylinder
block,
N
is
the
rotation
speed
in
rpm,
and
yeeta
v
is
the
volumetric
efficiency,
and
v
e
is
the
specific
volume
of
the
refrigerant
at
suction,
right.
…(1)
Where
A
=
Inner
diameter
of
the
cylinder 
B
=
Diameter
of
the
roller 
L
=
Length
of
the
cylinder
block 
N
=
Rotation
speed,
RPM 
η
V
=
Volumetric
efficiency 
v
e
=
specific
volume
of
refrigerant
at
suction
So,
this
way
we
have
found
out,
what
is
the
volumetric
efficiency
through,
or
mass
flow
rate,
knowing
through
the
volumetric
efficiency,
safe
volume,
and
v
e
right,
volume
of
the
refrigerant,
v
e,
is
the
specific
volume
of
the
refrigerant
at
the
suction
end,
right.
So,
this
we
have
shown,
yeeta
v
over
v
e
into
pi
by
4
into
N
by
60
into
A
square
minus
B
square
into
capital
L.
So,
we
have
said
A,
B
are
the
diameters,
N,
is
the
obviously,
the
rpm
and
yeeta
v
and
v
e,
yeeta
v
is
the
volumetric
efficiency,
and
v
e
is
the
specific
volume
of
this
refrigerant
at
the
suction
side,
right.
Then
it
comes,
multiple
vane
type
compressors,
right.
So,
multiple
vane
type
compressors,
another
type,
so,
this
is
as
it
is
shown
in
the
figure,
like
this,
this
is
the
multiple
vane,
ok.
And,
you
see,
this
is
the
suction,
and
this
is
the
discharge,
which
was
earlier
also.
Earlier,
we
had
one
vane,
but
here
we
have
multiple
vanes,
right
and
we
have,
these
are
the
sliding
vanes,
of
course,
and
this
is
the
cylinder
block,
and
as
the
sliding
vanes
are
moving,
because
this
is
moving
to
this,
this
is
coming
to
this,
this
is
coming
to
this,
and
this
is
going
back
to
this.
So,
this
way,
when
the
roll
is
rolling,
then,
multiple
vanes
are,
or
these
are
called
sliding
vanes.
They
are
working
right.
So,
if
you
go
back
to,
from
the
figure,
to
its
description,
that,
in
multiple
vane
type
compressor ,
the
axis
of
rotation
coincides
with
the
center
of
the
roller,
that
is,
as
we
have
shown
it
to
be
like
this,
right.
However,
it
is
concentric
with
respect
to
the
center
of
the
cylinder,
sorry,
it
is
eccentric
with
the,
with
the,
with
respect
to
the
center
of
the
cylinder,
and
that
is
why,
it
is
o
prime.
The
rotor
consists
of
a
number
of
slots,
with
sliding
vanes,
as
it
is
shown
here,
right.
This
is
o,
as
we
have
said,
it
is
concentric,
but
eccentric
with
the
cylinder,
o
prime,
right.
So,
this
we
can
say
that,
this
is
with
respect
to
the
multiple
vanes,
ok.
Then,
we
come
to,
we
come
to
that
sectional
view
of
a
multiple
vane
rotary
type
compressor .
Obviously,
it
has
cooling
water
jacket
as
this
one,
right.
It
has
vanes,
running
position,
like
this,
similarly,
the
suction
and
discharge
are
there,
and
there
are
some
check
valves,
as
in
the
discharge,
which,
we
said
earlier,
and
this
is
the
casing,
actually
mounted
on
a
base,
and
obviously,
there
are
off
center
rotors.
So,
this
is
how
the
sectional
view
of
a
multiple
vane
rotary
compressor
works.
So,
working
principle,
we
have
said,
next,
this
type
of
compressor
does
not
require
suction
or
discharge
valves.
However,
that,
as
it
is
shown,
in
this
figure,
that,
check
valves
are
used
on
discharge
side,
to
prevent
reverse
rotation
during
off
time,
right,
due
to
pressure
difference,
and
this
is
why
that
check
valve
is
used.
Since
there
are
no
discharge
valves,
the
compressed
refrigerant
is
opened
to
the
discharge
port,
when,
it
has
been
compressed
through
a
fixed
volume
ratio
depending
upon
the
geometry.
This
implies
that,
these
compressors
have
a
fixed
built-in
volume
ratio.
The
built-in
volume
ratio
is
defined
as
the
ratio
of
a
shell,
as
it
is
closed,
off
from
the
suction
port
to
its
volume,
before
it
opens
to
the
discharge
port.
Since,
the
volume
ratio
is
fixed,
the
pressure
ratio,
that
is,
Rp,
this
pressure
ratio
as
Rp,
we
have
also
talked
about
earlier
right.
This
pressure
ratio
can
be
said
to
be
equal
to
Pd
over
Ps
and
that
is
equal
to
Vb
to
the
power
k.
Obviously,
Pd
and
Ps
are
the
discharge
and
suction
pressures,
and
Vb
is
the
built-in
volume
ratio,
and
k
is
the
index
of
compression,
right.
…(2)
where
P
d
and
P
s
are
the
discharge
and
suction
pressures,
V
b
is
the
built-in
volume
ratio
and
k
is
the
index
of
compression.
So,
once,
we
know
this,
then,
we
can
come
to
rotary
screw
compressors.
Another
type,
where,
the
rotary
screw
compressors
can
be
either
twin
screw,
either
twin
screw
type,
or
single
screw
type,
right.
Twin
screw
is
more
often
used
than
single
screw,
because,
better
is
its
performance.
So,
twin
screw
compressors
are
like
this.
Twin
screw
type
compressors
consist
of
two
matching
helically
grooved
rotors,
one
male,
and
the
other
female.
Generally,
the
male
rotor
drives
the
female
rotor,
the
male
rotor
has
lobes,
while
the
female
rotor
has
flutes,
or
gullies,
right.
If
we
look
at
the
picture,
then,
it
becomes
easier
to
understand
that,
this
is
the
twin
screw
compressor
with
four
male
lobes,
and
six
female
gullies,
right.
So,
six
female
gullies
are
1,
2,
3,
4,
5
and
6,
and
4
lobes
of
the
male
rotor
is
1,
2,
3
and
4,
right.
It
is
made
in
such
a
way
that,
the
female
rotor
gully
will
fit
into
the
male
rotor
lobe,
right.
So,
both
are
rotating.
This
is
also
rotating,
this
is
also
rotating,
right.
So,
both
are
rotating
in
such
a
way
that
one
lobe,
when,
in
a
gully
of
another
rotor,
then
that
is
exactly
fitting
into
as
male
female.
So,
when
it
rotates,
comes
out,
then,
another
lobe,
that
goes
there,
and
the
next,
rather
another,
gully
goes
there,
and
the
next
lobe
comes
in,
and
fits
into
that.
This
is
how
is
the
principle
of
twin
screw.
Here,
we
have
shown
with
four
females,
rather,
four
male,
and
six
female,
four
male
lobes,
and
six
female
gullies,
right.
This
is
direction
of
refrigerant
flow
in
a
twin
screw
compressor .
As
it
is
seen
that,
the
suction
is
this
way,
you
see,
the
lobes,
this
is
the
twin
screw,
discharges
like
that,
and
the
lobes
and
the
gullies
are
in
such
a
way
that,
exactly,
we
are
saying
that,
it
is
matching
like
male
female,
and
there
is
no
such
leakage,
right.
Now,
if
we
look
at
the
lubrication,
the
lubrication
and
sealing
between
the
rotors,
is
obtained
by
injecting
some
lubricating
oil
between
the
rotors.
The
oil
also
helps
in
cooling
the
compressor .
As
a
result,
very
high
pressure
ratios,
up
to
20
is
to
1,
are
possible,
without
overheating
the
compressor .
So,
it
is
so
high,
that
it,
up
to
20
is
to
1,
compression
ratio,
is
possible
without
heating
the
compressor ,
right.
Then,
we
come
to
single
screw,
because,
twin
screw,
we
are
not
having
that
much
of
time
to
tell.
Detail
analysis,
because,
this
is
the,
perhaps,
last
class
for
the
compressor ,
and
the
other
part
remaining
is
that
single
screw,
right.
So,
when
we
are
coming
to
single
screw,
as
the
name,
it
applies,
single
screw
compressors,
consist
of
a
single
helical
screw.
So,
helical
screw,
just
like
before,
we
have
shown,
right,
just
like
before
we
have
shown,
helical
screw,
these
are
helical
screws,
right.
So,
but
here,
it
is
a
single
helical
screw,
right.
So,
it
consists
of
a
single
helical
screw
compressor ,
that
is,
single
helical
screw
and
two
planet
wheels,
or
gate
rotors,
are
involved
in
it,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at
the
working
principle
of
a
single
screw,
then
we
see,
like
the
suction,
this
is
the
screw,
that
single
screw
is
like
this.
So,
and
this
is
the
discharge,
and
these
are,
as
we
said
helical
screws,
only
the
section,
we
have
shown,
and
these
are
gate
motors,
right.
This
one,
this
one,right.
So,
in
principle,
it
is
a
single
screw
with
the
gate
motors
ok.
And,
if
we
look
at
the,
of
course,
we
have
only
couple
of
minutes
left.
So,
if
we
are
skipping
that,
how
the
only,
we
have
shown,
the
principle
through
the
photo,
through
the,
through
the
schematic
diagram,
but
some
other
types
like
scroll
compressors,
right,
scroll
compressors
are
also
there,
under
this
heading,
and
there
is
a
suction,
there
is
a
compression,
and
there
is
discharge,
all
three
are
there,
it
also
has
detailed
analysis.
So,
this
is
the
working
principle
of
a
scroll
compressor ,
it
also
has
detailed
analysis,
but,
due
to
the
shortage
of
time,
we
are
not
going
into
detail
of
it,
right.
Repeatedly ,
I
have
said
that,
we
have
given
more
strength
or
more
emphasis
on
the
to
and
fro,
that
is
used
in
most
of
the
refrigeration
system,
right.
So,
if
we
look
at,
no,
perhaps
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
class
because
time
is,
I
am
observing,
is
over,
but,
before
I
thank
you,
I
request
you,
the
detail
of
which,
we
could
not
cover
up
for
the
twin
screw,
if
you
can,
ifyou
are
wishing,
right.
So,
if
you
are
wishing,
you
can
go
through
any
standard
book,
or
as
we
said
ASHRAE
handbook
ASHRAE
again
I
am
writing
that
this
is
ASHRAE
handbook,
where,
you
will
also
get
all
the
things
in
detail,
right,
or
any
standard
book
of
refrigeration.
I
told
also,
my
teacher,
professor
R.
C.
Arora,
he
also
has
a
book,
and
if
you
can
go
through
in
detail,
obviously,
we
could
not
cover
the
part,
which
you
can
go
through
them,
right.
So,
with
this,
I
really
thank
you,
and
next
time,,
we
shall
go
to
the
application
side,
right.
Now,
we
shall
go
to
condenser,
first,
sorry,
this
parts
are
not
over,
only
compressor
is
over,
condenser,
then
expansion
device,
and
evaporator.
So,
after
that,
our
refrigeration
part
is
over.
We
will
go
to
the
2
class
2
weeks
for
its
application
right.
Thank
you.
