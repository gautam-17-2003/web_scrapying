Introduction to Cooling
Good
morning
my
dear
students.
At
the
outset
let
me
wish
all
of
you
Shubho
Bijaya.
Just
now
DP
has
been
over,
i.e.,
Durga
Puja,
and
as
you
know
that
in
Bengal
it
is
a
big
ceremony
and
we
obviously ,
go
to
the
full
extent
of
our
enjoyment
and
also
Puja.
However ,
we
are
now
in
a
new
course
and
this
is
under
NPTEL
and
the
name
of
the
course  is CoolingT echnology Why and How it is utilized in food, right.
And
it
is
a
cooling
technology
and
its
application,
because
as
the
name
suggests
that
why
and
how
it
is
used
in
food
that
needs
to
tell
that
how
the
cooling
is
produced
and
why
it
is
produced,
right.
You
do
not
go
to
the
market
and
buy
anything
which
is
not
required.
So,
you
must
know
that
why
it
is
used
or
required
and
how
it
can
be
produced,
so
that
we
will
do
obviously ,
while
doing
it
many
ancillary
things
may
come
up,
it
may
be
beyond
the
scope
of
the
course
curriculum,
but
even
then,
I
feel,
any
new
thing,
which
will
come,
I
will
try
to
touch
upon
or
brush
it
up,
so,
that
your
old
memory
can
be
utilized
successfully ,
right.
So,
whenever
we
are
talking
about
cooling,
let
me
tell
you
some
preliminary
things,
which
you
also
perhaps
know ,
but
even
as
a
recapitulation
for
you, or you may not be knowing because  you do not know .
Now ,
the
thing
is
that,
I
hope
in
everybody's
house,
at
this
present
time,
in
everybody's
house,
there
is
a
refrigerator ,
right
and
this
refrigerator
is
nothing,
but
a
cooling
unit.
Those,
who
are
in
very
very
cold
area
like
at
very
high
altitude
like
Darjeeling
or
Kashmir
or
Ladakh
or
things
like
that,
for
them,
already
nature
has
produced
cold,
but
those
who
are
say
in
Delhi,
Delhi
of
course,
during
this
November
December
January
February ,
this
3
4
months,
is
very
cold,
but
say
some
part
of
Rajasthan,
some
part
of
Maharashtra,
some
part
of
Bangalore,
Mysore,
Karnataka,
Chennai,
Bengal,
some
part
of
northern
places,
Bhopal,
MP.
Similarly ,
many
other
places
round
the
year
it
is
hot
except
for
1
-
2
months
during
winter
season
and
that
also
does
not
go
in
most
of
the
cases
less
than
around
10
degree
of
course,
in
centigrade.
Now ,
in
this
10
degree
centigrade
many
food
materials
are
not
supposed
to
be
kept
for
a
long
period.
It
can
be
for
1
-
2
days,
fine
no
problem,
but
if
you
have
to
keep
it
for
a
longer
period,
then,
it
is
not,
and
that
is
why
the refrigerator has come in  your house.
Now ,
the
question
comes
from
the
knowledge
point
of
view .
Afterwards
you
will
seewhen
we
are
proceeding
towards
the
right
class
or
right
period,
there
you
will
be
talking
about
how
the
cold
is
produced
and
mostly
it
is
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system
or
VCRS
or
VCRC
whatever
you
call.
In
this
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system
if
I
ask
you,
whether
you
have
seen
your
refrigerator
every
day
or
not?
Your
parents
have
used
your
elder
sisters
brothers
they
have
used,
but
have
you
ever
asked
them
that
which
one
is
compressor ,
which
one
is
condenser ,
which
one
is
evaporator
and
which
one
is
expansion
device?
These
are
the
4
components
of
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system.
So,
if
you
have
not
asked,
if
you
know ,
obviously ,
you
will
not
ask
if
you
know ,
but
if
you
do
not
know ,
if
you
have
not
asked
then,
ask
today
because
when
you
will
be
marrying
and
you
will
have
your
children,
it
may
so
happen
at
some
point
of
time.
Nowadays,
schools
are
starting
right
at
1
and
half
year
to
2
year
of
the
child
that
is
pre-school  etc, etc.
So,
lot
of
information,
they
gather
and
they
may
ask
you
papa,
mammi,
who
so
ever,
what
is
this
fellow
which
is
on
the
one
side
of
the
room
or
kitchen
wherever .
Then
you
have
to
answer
and
you
know
for
the
child,
the
best
teacher
is
the
parents,
best
teacher
is
the
parents
not
the
schools
not
the
other
places
because
they
learn
mostly
from
the
parents
and
environment.
So,
if
you
are
asked
what
is
this
and
if
you
are
not
able
to
answer ,
it
is
not
that
every
part
in
the
world
you
are
supposed
to
know ,
and
you
will
be
able
to
answer ,
that
is
also
true.
But
this
is
so
common
and
so
obvious
that
they
will
think
that
my
parents
do
not
know
this
is
what
is
the
bad
part
because
as
I
said,
to
the
child,
the
most,
what
should
I
say,
the
most
lovable
person
or
respectable
person
is
the
parents
and
if
parents
are
not
able
to
answer
to
their
queries
then
obviously ,
that
is
against the confidence of the child.  However , you can look at the refrigerator .
Now ,
now-a-days
there
are
2
types
of
refrigerators.
which
is
totally
a
box
from
outside
you
do
not
understand
anything
just
a
box.
It
can
be
single
door,
double
door,
triple
door
depending
on
the
type
of
freezer
or
a
refrigerator ,
rather .
So,
if
it
is
a
single
door
or
double
door
whatever ,
but
you
do
not
understand
from
the
outside,
but
if
you
can
come
across
with
the
old
ones
where
there
is
a
compressor
down
below
the
box,
there
is
an
expansion
device
again
that
is
down
below
the
box,
there
is
a
coil
inside
the
box,
on
the
top
of
the
box,
there
are
some
coils
right
and
on
the
back
side
of
the
box,
there
is
a,
what
we
call
usually ,
that
is
a
net,
there
is
a
net
kind
of
thing
made
of,
of
course,
pipes
small
small
very
small
pipes,
but
it
is
appearing
like
a
net.
So
these
parts
if
we
identify
then
if
we
tell
our
children
they
will
be
very
happy
and
their
confidence
on
the
parents
will
also
go up.
Why
I
am
starting
with
this
because
this
is
the
beginning
which
is
at
home
and
you
should
know
and
you
should
learn.
If
you
know ,
I
am
sorry ,
for
repetition,
but
if
you
do
not
know
and
there
will
be
many
who
do
not
know ,
of
course,
there
will
be
few
who
alsoknow ,
right.
So,
as
I
told,
the
modern
refrigerators,
which
are
in
the
market,
they
do
not
have
anything
which
is
visible
from
outside,
it
is
just
like
a
box
one
as
I
told
one
or
two
or
three
depending
on
the
freezer
you
are
buying.
Then
there
also
if
you
watch
that
one
side
of
the
refrigerator
is
warm
right
and
if
you
have
watched,
even
smaller
kids
those
who
are
crawling
or
walking,
starting
walking
etc,
If
you
have
the
older
ones
even
the
new
one
by
chance
if
they
have
touched
upon
the
hot
side
they
will
never
go
to
that
place
again
and
touch
it
otherwise
most
of
the
child
they
play
with
the
things
available
in
the
house
apart
from
their
own
toys.
So
if
they
touch
the
hot
side
that
will
be
a
lesson
to
them that this is hot do not come  and touch it again.
It
is
from
the
beginning
of
the
childhood
where
the
age
could
be
around
plus
minus
6
months
they
are
crawling
or
walking
and
if
you
have
or
they
have
the
old
version
models
they
are
also
on
the
backside
that
net
which
I
said
if
they
touch
once
they
will
never
again
go
to
the
place
of
the
refrigerator
which
is
kept
right.
This
is
the
tendency
or
nature
of
the
children
or
everybody
even
we,
when
we
were
also
young,
of
course,
I
do
not
remember
during
my
old
those
days
whether
there
was
any
refrigerator
in
our
house
or
not,
most
likely
not.
However ,
we
have
seen
our
children,
we
have
seen
other
children
the
similar
things
are
happening.
Now ,
let
us
come
to
that,
which
one
is
what?
As
far
as
the
first
one
I
said,
the
box,
which
is
not
visible,
the
entire
thing,
because
it
has
to
have
a
compressor
a
condenser
an
expansion
device
and
an
evaporator .
So,
there
also
nothing
is
visible
you
cannot
see
from
outside
or
from
inside
also,
but
you
know
that
there
is
some
deep frosting, and this deep frosting is automatically done  in those cases.
But,
if
you
as
I
said,
if
you
touch
one
side
you
will
see,
it
is
hotter
and
the
condenser
unit
is
there,
right,
whatever
heat
is
being
transferred
to
the
ambient
that
is
condensing
the
compressed
gas,
right.
Compressor ,
that
is
black,
will
come
in
detail
when
we
will
be
coming
into
the
appropriate
place.
So,
that
is
the
compressor ,
by
the
side
and
compressor
is
also
hot.
So,
the
child,
who
is
crawling
or
walking
at
that
stage,
if
they
have
the
tendency
to
know
the
unknown,
both
by
either
touching
or
putting
into
mouth
if
whatever
is
possible.
So,
if
they
have
ever
touched
that
compressor
in
absence
of
you
of
course,
in
presence
of
you
will
not
allow
in
absence
of
you
if
they
have
ever
touched
they
will
not
again
go
back
to
that
place
because
they
have
gotten
a
shock
this
is
thermal
shock as well as mental shock.
So
the
compressor
by
the
side
of
that
there
is
an
expansion
device
generally
this
household
refrigerator
they
have
the
expansion
device
through
capillary
tubes.
So
we
identify
two
other
two
one
is
the
condenser
which
is
behind
there
or
on
the
back
side
of
the
refrigerator .
So
on
the
back
side
of
the
refrigerator
which
is
there
that
is
the
condenser
and
that
also
is
hot.
So
the
child,
if
he
goes
there,
touches
will
never
again
go
there.
Now ,
why
there
are
many
types
of
condensers,
many
types
will
come
during
thecourse
of
the
classes
many
types
are
there
and
this
one
is
typically
called
air
cooled
because
surrounding
air
cools,
and
that
is
why
you
will
see,
you
will
observe
at
home
the
refrigerator
is
kept
at
a
little
away
from
the
wall
it
is
never
placed
one
to
one
against
the
wall.
There
is
a
gap
between
the
wall
and
the
refrigerator
why
because
air
from
the
surrounding
has
to
blow
or
flow.
So
that
the
condenser
is
condensing
and
it
is
being
transferred
from
the
condenser
to
the
surrounding.
Then
next
one
is
the
evaporator ,
now
which
one
shall
you
call
evaporator?
I
told
that
in
the
old
models
there
are
some
coils
down
below
in
side
the
top
that
is
called
freezer
cabinet.
So
in
that
freezer
cabinet
down
below
you
might
have
seen
some
coils
which
are
there
and
as
I
told
that
in
the
present
ones
that
is
the
modern
ones
they
do
not
have
any
such
evaporator ,
right.
Then
the
old
ones,
as
I
said,
there
is
some,
shall
we
call
that
to
be
evaporator ,
the
question
comes
what
is
the
function
of
the
evaporator
?
Compressor
compresses
the
gas
then
condenser
condenses
the
gas
to
liquid,
fine,
expansion
device
throttles
the
liquid
to
low
temperature
you
desire,
evaporator
what
it
does,
it
accumulates
heat
from
the
material
from
the
surrounding
from
everywhere
and
give
it
to
the
evaporator
and
thereby
the
coil
or
thereby
the
liquid,
liquefied
gas
get
expanded
or
gasified
and
that
again
goes
to
the
compressor right.
So,
if
we
know
this
function
of
the
evaporator
then
shall
we
call
only
the
freezer
cabinet
down
below
where
the
coils
are
there
shall
we
call
that
to
be
only
evaporator
since
you
are
not
able
to
reply .
So
let
me
tell
you
on
your
behalf
no
it
is
not
that
because
apart
from
the
freezer
cabinet
where
you
are
keeping
fish
meat
other
things
which
are
stored
for
number
of
days,
right.
So
apart
from
that,
there
are
trays
down
below
that
freezer
cabinet
and
in
that
trays
you
are
keeping
either
leftover
food
material
or
freshly
prepared
food
material
for
future
use.
There
is
also
absolutely
down
below ,
there
is
also
a
cabinet
and
there
you
are
keeping
the
fruits
vegetables
everything
on
the
door
you
are
keeping
lot
of
things
for
cooling,
maybe
water
maybe
some
other
things
and
maybe
some
valuable
like
egg
also
there
is
a
place
where
you
are
keeping
eggs.
So,
are
they
not
contributing
to
the
heat
to
the
evaporator?
Obviously ,
because
if
you
even
touch
the
egg
it
is
cold
if
you
touch the water which you have kept that is cold.
There
is
water
ice
tray
forming
ice,
right
from
water
to
ice
that
is
also
getting
cold.
So,
all
these
are
contributing
heat
to
the
evaporator ,
then
outside
temperature,
which
is
depending
on
time,
of
course,
time
of
the
year
it
is,
maybe
30,
maybe
40
maybe
50
degree
centigrade
whereas,
insid,e
is
4
5
6
8
10
degree
centigrade
or
in
the
freezer
cabinet
it
is
minus
10
degree
centigrade.
So,
out
of
this
in
whole
delta
T
is
a
lot,
delta
T
is
50,
if
you
take
plus
40
ambient
and
freezer
cabinet
is
minus
10.
So,
50
degree
centigrade
delta
T
so,
lot
of
heat
will
be
infiltrating.
So
that
is
taken
care
of
by
theevaporator ,
right,
then
whom
we
can
call
the
evaporator
in
that
refrigerator
system,
it
is
the entire box, right.
Let
me
draw
a
little
if
you
will
understand
that
it
is
the
entire
box.
So
you
have
this
freezer
right
and
and
you
have
trays
like
this
like
this
like
this,
you
have
one
freezer
cabinet
like
this,
right,
it
may
have
one
holding
system,
right
and
we
said
compressor
is
down
below
we
said
expansion
device
is
down
below
which
on
the
back
side
of
it.
if
we
look
from
the
back
side
then
it
will
look
like
this
that
there
are
like
this
some
thing
so,
this
is
the
condenser
right.
So,
if
that
be
our
question
was
which
one
is
the
evaporator
out
of
this
entire
box,
sorry
for
redoing
redrawing
because
then
we
had
the
cabinet.
So,
cabinet
is
c
a
b
cabinet
we
had
the
compressor
here
we
had
that
expansion
device
here
and
we
have
different
shelf
to
keep
many
things
and
down
below
there
is
one
again
fruits
and
vegetables
holding
things
and
this
side,
this
side,
this
side,
this
side,
that
side,
and
below  all are insulated.
In
the
earlier
stages,
it
was
with
glass
wool,
but
nowadays
it
is
with
puff
PUF
polyurethane
foam
which
is
expanded
in
situ,
right.
So,
this
puf
or
insulation
is
protecting
inside
here,
say,
4
degree
centigrade,
inside
here,
say
minus
10
degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
this
insulation,
this
puf
is
protecting
the
entire
freezer
from
outside
40
degree
centigrade,
right.
Whereas,
these
people
are
around
4
degree
centigrade.
So,
total
heat
is
coming
from
the
cabinet,
where
you
have
put
legs
of,
maybe
chicken,
or
parts
of
fish
etc
or
meat,
here
you
have
kept
some
dishes
which
are
already
prepared
or
maybe the leftover from the previous lunch or dinner or breakfast whatever .
So,
everybody
is
contributing
to
the
total
heat
required
for
evaporator
right
total
heat
available
from
the
evaporator .
So,
we
can
say
that
the
entire
body ,
the
entire
body
of
the
refrigerator
is
acting
as
evaporator
it
is
not
the
coil
down
below
here,
right.
Whereas,
it
is
through
which
the
liquefied
gas
is
moving
and
that
is
cooling
the
cabinet
and
that
is
in
turn,
because
it
is
hot,
it
is
cold,
you
know
cold
air
will
be
thicker
it
will
come
down
and
hot
air
will
be
lighter
it
will
go
up.
So,
this
way,
there
is
a
convection
current
inside
the
freezer
and
it
is
keeping
the
temperature
low
right.
So,
this
is
the
way
how
we
say
that
the entire body is the freezer entire body of the freezer  is or refrigerator is evaporator ok.
So,
thank
you
for
this
class
this
is
the
preamble
or
very
preliminary
of
the
cooling
ok.
Thank you, so nice.
