Good
afternoon.
Now ,
we
are
in
the
last
phase
of
freezing.
As
you
know
earlier
also,
I
had
shown
you
and
told
you
that,
the
freezing
curve,
ok,
we
have
said,
but
the
water ,
which
gets
frozen
is
asymptotic
in
nature,
right.
So,
this
is
what
we
will
come
to
know
and
afterwards
we
will
do
the
dif ferent
freezers,
right,
dif ferent
freezers
in
detail
we
will
talk
about.
So,
what
we
see
that,
this
one,
this
one.
I
had
perhaps,
told
you
earlier
also
that,
if
you
plot
time
versus
percent
water
frozen,
then,
you
will
get,
I
mean
rather ,
temperature
versus
percent
water
frozen.
Now ,
which
one
will
be,
you
are
plotting
temperature
and
percent
water
frozen.
So,
which
one
will
be
in
the
x,
that
is,
x
direction,
and
which
one
will
be
in
the
y
direction,
that
is,
which
one
will
be
independent
variable,
and
which
one
will
be
dependent
variable,
right.
So,
if
you
could
find
out,
very
nice,
otherwise,
you
see
what
we
call
independent,
which
is,
on
which
some
other
is
depending,
right.
So,
which
one
is
depending
here,
percent
water
frozen
is
depending
on
the
temperature,
right.
So,
temperature
is
in
the
x
axis,
and
percent
water
frozen
is
in
the
y
axis,
right,
and
if
you
have
a
plot,
right,
you
will
see,
you
will
get
a
temperature
curve,
like
this,
or
a
temperature
curve
depending
on
how
you
are
plotting,
what
are
the
temperatures,
what
are
the
percent
water
frozen.
So,
these
are
called,
both
these
and
that
are
called
asymptotic,
A
S
Y
M
P
T
O
T
I
C.
So,
this
is
called
asymptotic
in
nature,
right.
That
means,
just
in
the
previous
class,
we
said
that
the
water ,
which
is
freezable,
right,
which
indicates
that
there
is
some
bound
water ,
that
means,
that
cannot
be
frozen
so
easily .
This
is
called
bound
water
right.
So,
this
curve
or
this
plot
or
this
T able
tells
us
that
thing,
that
there
are
some
water ,
like
here,
90
percent,
you
could
have
frozen
at
minus
30
o
C,
but
if
to
make
it
91
or
92,
you
may
have
to
go
to
minus
45
o
C,
or
things
like
that.
So,
that
is
not
easily
freezable,
right,
there
is
nothing
in
the
world,
which
cannot
be
frozen,
you
can
freeze
the
entire
thing,
but
you
have
to
pay
for
that,
right.
In
normal
freezing,
you
cannot
freeze
more
than
around
90%,
or
depending
on
the
material,
90,
95,
92,
89,
85%,
depending
on
the
material,
some
water
is
freezable,
some
water
is
unfreezable,
which
is
not
freezable,
that
is
called
bound
water ,
right.
So,
wecome
to
storage
life
of
frozen
foods,
and
that
is
normally
at
or
below
minus
18
degree
centigrade.
So,
products
with
storage
lives
between
3
to
6
months
and
there
are
some
mammalian
meats,
poultry ,
etc.
Products
with
storage
lives
of
3
months
or
less,
again
that
is
mammalian
meats,
bakery
products,
etc.
Products
with
lives
of
6
to
12
months
at
or
below
minus
18
degree
centigrade,
say
fish,
mammalian
meat,
poultry ,
bakery
products,
etc.
and
products
with
storage
lives
of
not
3,
more
than,
greater
than
or
equal
to
12
months,
or
more,
like
fruits,
they
are
sugared
food,
fruits,
vegetables,
mammalian
meats,
fish,
egg,
bakery
products
etc.
at
minus
18
o
C,
or
below
temperature,
this
is
the
normal
life
span
for
the
frozen
material,
right.
Then,
there
are
freezers,
then
we
come
to
freezers,
ok.
Now ,
the
moment
we
come
to
freezers,
we
tell
that,
we
had
given
you
a
story
of,
we
had
given
you
a
story
of
drip
loss,
of
our
prime
minister ,
and
US
president,
right.
And
that
have
paid,
because
the
choice
of
freezer
was
not
appropriate.
By
definition,
we
have
3
types
of
freezers,
that
is
by
definition,
3
types
of
freezers
are
there,
one
is
called
primary
freezer ,
right.
So,
what
we
use
in
primary
freezers,
that
is
products
are
in
direct
contact
with
the
refrigerant,
in
the
form
of
a
cryogenic
gas
or
cryogenic
liquid,
or
maybe
solid.
Now ,
cryogenic
liquid,
solid,
we
know
liquid
nitrogen
is
a
cryogenic
liquid.
Liquid
oxygen
is
also
a
cryogenic
liquid,
but
normally
liquid
oxygen
is
not
used
because,
liquid
oxygen
is
used
mostly ,
in
maybe,
steel
plant,
or
more
in
medical
hospitals.
But,
yes,
liquid
ammonia,
even
is
cryogenic
liquid,
solid
carbon
dioxide
is
a
cryogenic
solid,
right.
Solid
carbon
dioxide,
I
hope
you
know ,
what
it
is
called,
it
is
called
dry
ice,
right.
Dry
ice
is
solid
carbon
dioxide,
whose
melting
point
is
minus
78
degree
centigrade,
right,
whose
melting
point
is
minus
78
degree
centigrade,
that
is
called
solid
carbon
dioxide,
or
dry
ice
right.
Now ,
all
these
cryogens,
unlike
we
have
read
the
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system,
unlike
with
that,
there
are
dif ferent
cycles,
by
which
air
is
liquefied,
and
then
this
liquefied
air
is
distilled
and
obviously ,
the
boiling
point
of
oxygen
is
less
than
that
of
nitrogen.
So,
first
oxygen
comes
out,
and
the
nitrogen
proportion
goes
up.
In
many
developed
countries,
this
is
used
as
a
byproduct,
that
nitrogen
is
used
as
a
byproduct,
and
liquid
oxygen
is
used
as
a
main
product,
because
that
is
more
useful
in
hospitals,
and
also
many
other
places
like
steel
factories,
and
many
others.
So,
oxygen
is
produced
from
the
air ,
and
liquid
nitrogen,
in
those
countries,
is
obtained
as
byproduct.
The
advantage
of
getting
it
as
byproduct
is
that
the
price
of
this
is
much
much
less
compared
to
that
of
the
oxygen,
main
product,
right.
So,
in
their
countries,
in
developed
countries,
this
primary
freezers
are
many
in
use.
Unfortunately ,
in
our
country ,
it
is
not
there
as
of
now ,
right.
I
know
one
case,
thatBritish
oxygen
or
BOC,
they
had
given
one
such
freezer
to
some
company ,
and
asked
them
with
all
facility ,
including
liquid
nitrogen
supply ,
without
taking
any
price,
perhaps,
I
am
not
sure
about
that,
asked
some
company
to
run
it
for
2
years,
and
give
the
report.
I
came
to
know ,
it
was
said
that
no
it
is
good,
but
is
not
fit
to
our
systems,
or
etc.
Y es,
I
agree
to
one
part,
that
this
liquid
nitrogen,
typically
is
not
available
everywhere.
In
eastern
India
it
is
available
in
Kolkata
in
Jamshedpur .
So,
what
about
in
between
places?
In
IIT
Kharagpur ,
we
have
our
own
machine.
So,
there,
we
are
producing,
and
we
use,
but,
what
about
in
between
places?
So,
if
I
have
one
unit
at
Jhar gram,
or
say
Kharagpur ,
then
where
from
the
nitrogen
will
come?
So,
availability
of
this
is
one
great
disadvantage
in
developing
countries,
but
in
developed
countries,
they
get
it
as
byproduct,
so,
the
price
is
also
low .
However ,
those,
which
come
directly
in
contact
with
the
material,
like,
if
it
is
a
say ,
fish,
or
say
a
meat,
or
whatever
fish,
and
if
it
comes
in
direct
contact
with
liquid
nitrogen,
or
maybe
some
other
liquefied
gases,
then
there,
you
know ,
liquid
nitrogen
has
a
boiling
point
of
minus
195.6
degree
centigrade.
So,
such
a
huge
delta
T ,
right,
this
temperature
is
plus
30
o
C,
say
and
minus
195
o
C.
So,
220
to
230
degree
centigrade
is
there
as
delta
T ,
right,
and
overall
heat
transfer
coef ficient,
is
also
high.
So,
almost
instantaneously ,
the
freezing
is
done,
almost
instantaneously ,
right.
In
our
country ,
either
moderate
freezing
rate,
that
kind
of
freezers,
where
it
takes
several
hours,
whereas,
here,
it
is
taking,
maybe
few
seconds
to
couple
of
minutes,
because
of
the
temperature
dif ference,
and
high
heat
transfer
coef ficient,
overall
heat
transfer
coef ficient,
right.
So,
those,
which
come
in
contact
with
the
refrigerant
directly ,
those
freezers
are
called
primary
freezers,
right.
Obviously ,
the
merits
are
very
very
high,
like
with
that
high
temperature
dif ference
and
high
overall
heat
transfer
coef ficients,
the
size
of
the
ice
crystals,
which
are
formed,
are
very
very
small.
So,
number
of
ice
crystals
forms
are
very
very
high,
whereas,
size
of
the
ice
crystals
formed
are
very
very
less,
right.
So,
we
can
get
frozen
material,
which
has
very
small
ice
crystals,
more
in
number ,
and
when,
it
is
thawed
back,
the
drip
loss
is
also
as
minimum,
as
possible,
maybe,
negligible,
right.
So,
that
is
one
of
the
biggest
advantage
of
this,
that
the
quality
of
the
product
is
very
very
high,
and
we
have
said
earlier
also
that,
one
of
the
prime
reason
of
quality
assessment,
is
one
of
the
prime
factor
is
that,
finding
out
what
is
the
size
of
the
crystal,
and
how
many
numbers
in
crystals
are
there.
So
we
get
very
suitable
for
small
and
thin
product,
very
small
ice
crystals,
insignificant
dehydration,
colour ,
flavour ,
structural
changes
are
minimum,
and
drip
loss
in
thawing
is
also
negligible
or
as
minimum
as
possible.
It
being
such
a
beautiful
freezing
device,
why
then
it
is
not
used
in
developing
countries?
One
of
the
reason,
which
I
just
said
that,
the
availability ,
is
not
available
everywhere
uniformly ,
and
also
the
price,
one
of
the
prime
factor ,
because,
the
moment
the
primaryrefrigerant
is
coming
in
contact
with
the
material
to
be
frozen,
that
primary
refrigerant
is
getting
vaporized,
and
this
vapour
is
not
reusable,
unlike
vapour
compression
refrigeration
systems,
where,
the
liquid
vapor
refrigerant,
when
it
is
vaporized,
in
the
evaporator ,
it
can
be
recycled
through
compressor ,
but
this
type
of
refrigerant
are
called
total
loss
refrigerant,
right,
total
loss
refrigerant,
and
because
of
this,
total
loss,
that
means,
you
are
not
able
to
put
it
back,
price
is
also
high
right.
Unfortunately ,
this
is
also
negotiable,
because
if
your
consumption
is
very
high,
then
you
will
get
at
a
very
considerable
rate.
When,
I
was
in
Quality
Frozen
Foods,
Mumbai,
I
used
to
get
from
BOC
at
a
rate
of
5
rupees
per
cubic
metre.
It
was
very
very
cheap.
However ,
this
is
one
demerit,
that
is,
not
available
everywhere
uniformly ,
and
the
price.
Another
technical
defect
is
that,
the
price,
but
because
of
the
delta
T ,
high,
this
is
the
food
product,
because
the
delta
T
is
very
high,
is
around,
less
than
200
degree,
right.
The
surface
gets
frozen
very
quickly
compared
to
the
interior .
So
there
is
a
delta
T
dif ference,
from
inside
to
outside,
and
this
may
cause
a
thermal
crack.
This
may
cause
a
thermal
crack.
Obviously ,
it
is
also
taken
care
of,
but,
if
you
can
take
care
of
it,
that
the
refrigerant
will
not
come
directly
in
contact
with
that,
then
you
can
avoid
it,
right,
because,
here
you
are
getting
both
latent
heat
as
well
as
sensible
heat,
both
you
are
getting,
because,
you
are
getting
200
degree
minus
say ,
may
not
be
200
say ,
minus
190
degree
centigrade,
you
are
getting
vapour .
So,
that
vapour
also,
you
can
utilize,
right.
So,
if
you
correctly
choose
it,
then
you
may
apply ,
you
may
get
benefit
out
of
that,
there
is
no
ambiguity
about
the
quality
of
the
frozen
material,
but
this
is
one
technical
dif ficulty ,
that
the
thermal
crack
may
be
there,
for
which,
you
have
to
take
care
of
the
freezing
system,
right
ok.
So,
the
lar ge
frozen
product
may
display
severe
cracking,
due
to
extremely
uneven
cooling
at
the
surface
and
interior ,
as
I
explained
just
now ,
right.
So,
there
is
then
the
another
type
that
is
called
secondary
one,
secondary
freezers,
right.
So,
secondary
freezers,
by
its
name,
we
can
understand
that,
if
this
is
the
primary ,
then
it
is
giving
it
to
some
other
one,
which
in
turn
is
giving
to
the
material
to
be
frozen.
So,
that
is
why ,
it
is
secondary ,
right.
T wo
steps,
that
refrigerant
is
cooling
the,
sorry ,
the
refrigerant
is
cooling
the
freezer ,
cooling
the
freezer
plates,
generally ,
it
is
plate
freezers,
by
and
lar ge.
So,
you
have
the
cooling
coil
down
below ,
and
these
are
adjustable.
So,
you
can,
you
can
do
this
way ,
and
that
way
this
can
be
adjustable,
and
the
food
material
is
kept
in
contact
with
this,
and
that,
right.
So,
this
is
called
plate
freezers,
and
plate
freezers
are
very
widely
used
in
developing
countries,
unlike
developed
countries,
right,
where
these
plate
freezers
are
not
normally ,
nowadays,
used
because
of,
as
we
have
shown,
the
drip
loss
is
very
very
high,
right.
Another
thing,
which
is
that,
this
plate
freezer ,
it
has
coil
in
both
the
plates
and
you
have
kept
your
material,
you
see,
it
beingplate,
two
plates.
So,
either
the
material
has
to
be
rectangular
shaped,
or
cubed
or
similar
kind
of
things.
So.
it
is
shape
dependent,
you
cannot
take
any
irregular
shape,
which
is
not
there
in
the
primary ,
because
primary ,
whatever
be
the
shape,
the
entire
material
is
coming
in
contract
with
the
primary
refrigerant.
So,
shape
is
not
af fecting,
size,
may
be
size,
everywhere
in
heat
transfer ,
size
is
one
of
the
factor ,
right,
but
shape,
in
this
case
is
the
one,
primary
one,
unless
it
has
a
definite
shape,
it
will
not
be,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
do
that,
right.
But,
it
has
a
great
advantage,
what
is
that
advantage?
Because,
it
is
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
because
the
plates
are
cooled
by
the
coil,
refrigerant
coils,
right,
and
the
refrigerant
is
passing
through
this
and
then
ultimately
going
to
the
back
to
compressor .
This
being
evaporator ,
going
back
to
the
compressor
and
again
through
condenser
then
expansion
device
then
coming
back
to
the
evaporator
back
to
compressor .
So,
this
is
in
a
in
a
cycle.
So,
that
is
reducing
the
running
cost
very
sharply ,
right,
running
cost
is
very
low ,
that
is
why ,
in
developing
countries,
where
you
get
the
support
of
buying
one
time,
that
support,
you
get,
but,
running
it,
you
do
not
get
any
financial
support.
So,
it
is
very
very
dif ficult
for
those
which
are
having
high
running
cost,
then
the
installation
cost
right.
If
installation
cost
is
high,
they
do
not
mind,
because
some
financial
or ganization
will
help,
but
running
cost
high
is
not
tolerated
in
the
developing
countries,
right.
So,
the
demerits,
which
we
can
say .
are
that,
irregular
shaped
product,
very
dif ficult
to
freeze,
time
of
freezing
is
very
high,
and
lar ger
ice
crystals
are
formed.
So,
quality
is
also
questionable
one,
right.
Then
the
third
one
is
called
tertiary
type,
right,
from
that
word
tertiary ,
means,
primary
is
giving
to
secondary ,
secondary
is
giving
to
tertiary ,
which
in
turn
is
giving
to
the
food
product,
that
is
three
steps.
So,
primary
refrigerant,
that
is
not
the
primary
refrigerant,
which
we
were
referring
to
earlier .
It
is
the
refrigerant,
whatever
you
are
using,
whether
vapour
compression
or
any
other ,
that
refrigerant
is
cooling
some
device,
normally
called
air
handling
unit,
AHU,
and
that
air
handling
unit,
which
is
a,
which
is
a
heat
exchanger ,
is
cooling
in
turn
air
and
this
cold
air
is
then
blasted
over
the
material,
and
the
material
gets
frozen.
So,
tertiary
means,
that
primary
one
is
giving
to
a
secondary
one
that
is
the
air
handling
unit,
and
that
air
handling
unit
is
a
heat
exchanger ,
is
giving
to
the
food
material,
air ,
sorry ,
giving
it
to
or
lowering
it
that,
lowering
the
temperature
of
air ,
and
this
air
is
then
blasting
over
the
material,
and
the
material
is
getting
frozen.
It
has
advantage
in
one
way ,
that,
it
can
also,
like
the
primary
freezer ,
it
can
also
handle
any
shape,
or
size.
So,
like
primary
one,
individual
quick
freezing,
IQF ,
is
possible
with
this
type
of
freezer
also,
but
one
of
the
defect,
as
I
said
earlier
also,
is
that
freezer
burn
may
be
possible
and
somewhat
drip
loss,
may
not
be,
to
the
tune
of
secondary
freezer ,
but
somewhat
drip
loss
is
a
concern.
Then,
lastly
let
me
show
you
this
is
one
primary
refrigerant,
that
is
liquid
nitrogen
freezer ,
right,this
is
how
the
single
units
are
getting
frozen,
there
will
be
three
zones,
one
is
freezing
zone,
one
is
pre
cooling
zone,
and
other
is
the
equilibration
zone,
right.
And
this
is
another
one
plate
freezers,
I
did
not
show ,
I
normally ,
it
is
very
easy
to
visualize
that,
these
are
the
two
plates,
and
their
coils
are
there,
ok.
This
is
a
tertiary
freezer ,
or
air ,
frozen
air ,
rather ,
cold
air
is
blasted,
right,
and
this
is
very
very
in
compact,
and
may
be
used
by ,
say ,
single
person,
and
this
is
a
spiral
freezer ,
right.
So,
with
this
our
time
is
up,
we
have
concluded
the
freezing
ok.
Thank
you
very
much.
