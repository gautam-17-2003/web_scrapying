Carnot Cycle (Contd.)
Good
afternoon
my
dear
boys
and
girls,
rather
my
dear
students.
Of
course,
I
wish
all
of
you
happy
Diwali,
and
we
had
done
in
the
previous
class
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
W
irreversible
cannot
be
or
work
done
by
the
irreversible
engine
cannot
be
greater
than
work done by the reversible engine right.  This we have established right.
Now
as
the
continuation
of
the
Carnot
cycle,
we
come
to
this
that
Carnot
first
corollary
was
minus
plus
equal
to
minus
right
and
we
have
shown
that
cannot
be
greater
than
right
cannot be greater than.
So,
we
come
to
this
next
possible,
if
is
equals
to
right,
if,
sorry ,
it
is
equals
to
then,
that
means,
irreversible
work
is
equal
to
reversible
work.
So,
under
that
situation,
here
you
see,
has
to
become,
it
is
equal
to,
then,
has
to
be
equal
to,
and
the
irreversible
engine
is
identical
to
the
reversible
engine,
it
is
no
longer
irreversible
engine.
It
is
equivalent
to,
that is, it  is just the one reversible engine, it  is becoming .
Then
it
is
nothing,
but
obtaining
another
reversible
engine
in
place
of
irreversible
engine
right,
because,
it
is
equal
to
then,
has
to
be
equal
to,
and
it
is
same
as,
or
rather ,
is
same
as,
then,
it
is
coming
the
same
reversible
engine.
So,
we
get
only
another
reversible
one.
We
can
say
that
Carnot's
first
corollary
is
this
is
less
than
and
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
over
right,
and
yeeta
thermal
reversible
is
over,
right.
Therefore,
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
has
to
be
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible
right,
yeeta
thermal
yeetata
is
the
efficiency ,
efficiency
is
yeeta.
So,
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible
why?
Yeeta
thermal
reversible
is
equal
to,
over,
right
and
we
have shown that, W I is not greater than,
We
have
also
shown,
that
is
not
equal
to,
because,
then,
it
becomes
a
reversible
engine.
So,
what
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that,
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible,
right.
I
hope,
you
have
understood
with
the
logic,
why
it
is,
because
we
started
with
greater
than
which,
we
saw
that
from
the
same
single
reservoir ,
it
is
perating
the
two
engines,
and
this
is
violating
the
Carnot
Planck,
sorry ,
Planck
Kelvin
Planck
statement.
If
it
is
violating
then,
cannot
be,
sorry ,
cannot
be
greater
than
that,
we
have
established.
We
also
established
that
is
not
equal
to,
because
if
becomes
equal
to,
then it is nothing, but another reversible engine, right.
So,
we
now
are
saying
that,
it
is
less
than,
there
is
only
option
left,
because,
both,
we
have
shown,
it
is
not
possible,
the
third
one
is
less
than
.
If
it
is
less
than,
then
yeeta
thermal
efficiency ,
which,
is
work
by,
rather ,
how
much
quantity ,
sorry ,
how
much
quantity
of
heat
you
have
supplied,
and
how
much
quantity
of
work
you
have
obtained,
right.
That
is
the
efficiency .
So,
that
is
for
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
and
this
is
also
for
yeeta
thermal
reversible,
how
much
quantity
of
heat
you
have
supplied
and
how
much
work
you
have
obtained,
that
is
the
efficiency ,
and
since
is
less
than,
so,
this
is
less
than
this term. So, yeeta thermal irreversible is less than yeeta thermal reversible  right.
So,
this
is
established
that,
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible.
Then,
we
can
say
that
the
second
corollary
of
the
Carnot
,
as
all
reversible
power
cycles,
operating
between
the
same
two
thermal
reservers,
have
the
same
thermal
efficiencies.
All
reversible
power
cycles
operating
between
the
same
two
thermal
reservers
have
the
same
thermal
efficiencies.
That
means,
yeeta
thermal
will
be
equal
to
another
yeeta
thermal
only
or
R
1
is
R
2
right.
So,
this
is
the
corollary
of
the,
second
corollary
of
Carnot,
and
we
can
say
in
that,
all
reversible
power
cycles
operating
between
the same two thermal reservers have the same thermal ef ficiency .  Right.
That
means,
again
we
are
putting
back,
we
have
two
reservers,
one
is
hot
reservoir ,
another
is
cold
reservoir ,
right.
In
other ,
this
is
hot
reservoir ,
and
this
is
cold
reservoir ,
right.
We
have
two
engines,
one
the
R
1,
and
one
R
2,
right,
instead
of
irreversible
engine,
which,
one
was
here,
we
are
now
putting
one
reversible
engine
as
R
2,
right.
Then
in
the
former
case,
which,
we
started
with
that
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
given
to
thereversible,
say
R
1
engine,
and
Q
H
quantity
of
heat,
we
have
given,
and
W
R
quantity
of
work
was
obtained
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir .
This
was,
the
first,
when,
we
have,
instead
of
R
as
I,
right
this
I
am
reminding
you.
Then,
we
also
had
shown
that,
when
it
was
I,
when,
instead
of
R,
when
it
was
I,
this
Q
C
quantity ,
or
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
right,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected,
W
R
quantity
of
work was done.
Now ,
we
reversed,,
since
it
is
a
reversible
engine,
we
reversed,
we
supplied
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
to
the
reversible
engine,
and
obtained
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
and
that
we
supplied
to
the
I,
that
is
irreversible
engine,
right.
Since,
we
have
already
established
that,
irreversible
engine
has
less
thermal
efficiency
than
that
of
the
reversible
thermal
efficiency .
Now ,
we
have
taken,
the
same
thing
instead
of
irreversible
one,
reversible
engine
R
1
and
another
reversible
engine
R
2
right,
and
the
same
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
we
have
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine
R
1,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir
and
W
R
quantity
of,
or
W
R
1
quantity
of
work
obtained
from
the
engine.
Now ,
we
reversed
again,
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
from
the
cold
reservoir
to
the
reversible
engine
R
1,
then
W
R
1
quantity
of
work
done
on
the
reversible
engine,
then
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
reservoir .
Now
instead
of
this
reservoir ,
now
if
we
reverse
and
supplied
to
the
another
engine
R
2
then,
Q
H
quantity ,
we
obtained
from
the
reverse of the reversible engine, that Q H quantity of heat is coming to the R 2 engine.
Q
dot
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected,
or
Q
C,
rather ,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
and
W
R
2
quantity
of
work
was
done
by
the
reversible
engine,
right.
So,
instead
of
irreversible
one,
we
have
now
done
the
same
thing
with
the
another
one
more
reversible
engine,
a
reversible
engine
R
1
and
reversible
engine
R
2,
right.
Then
we
can
say
as
Carnot
second
corollary
that,
both
engines
receive
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
and
Q
cycle
is
becoming
0
because,
it
was
producing,
Q
H
was
supplied
to
the
engine
reversible,
Q
C
quantity
was
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir .
Now
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
taken
from
the
cold
reservoir ,
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine
R
1
for
to
whom
W
R
1
quantity
of
work
was
done
and
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
was
obtained,
which
was
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine R 2, right. That means, in the cycle we are not changing anything.
So,
Q
cycle
becomes
equal
to
0
right.
So,
for
both
the
engines,
receive
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
and
Q
cycle
therefore,
becomes
equal
to
0,
and
W
cycle
also
becomes
equal
to
0,
for
both
the
engines
with
one
reservoir ,
and
because,
they
are
both
reversible,
right.
So,
one
is
reversed
from
both
R
1
and
R
2,
what
we
did
this
was
there,
and
then,
we
reversed
this.
So,
this
was
there,
this
was
there,
for
which
we
got
the
same
Q
H
right,
and
ultimately
same
Q,
sorry ,
same
yeah,
same
Q
C
and
the
same
W
R,
right.
So,
if
this
be
same
for
the
two
reversible
engines,
we
can
say
that
W
cycle
is
0,
and
Q
cycle
is
also
0,
for
both
reversible engines, if one is reversed right.So,
we
can
say
with
engine
1,
as
reversed,
we
can
say,
W
cycle
is
0
is
equal
to
W
R
1
minus
W
R
2
and
therefore,
W
R
1
is
nothing,
but
equal
to
W
R
2,
right.
So,
we
say
that,
W
cycle
being
0,
W,
and
that
is
equal
to
W
R
1
minus
W
R
2,
and
this
leads
to
the
fact
that
W
R
1
becomes
equal
to
W
R
2,
right.
Then,
we
can
say
as
Carnot
second
corollary
that
is,
W
yeeta
thermal
R
2,
is
equal
to
W
R
2,
by
Q
H
and
which,
is
also
equal
to
W
R
1
by
Q
H
and
is
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
1,
which
I
just
said,
sometime
back,
right.
So,
yeeta
thermal
R
2
is
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
1.
That
means,
all
reversible
engines
have
the
same
thermal
efficiencies,
all
reversible
engines
working
under
the
same
reservoir ,
that  is, that, hot and cold reservoir , they have the same thermal ef ficiency right.
This
is
again
we
have
established,
with
taking
two
engines
reversible,
as
R
1
and
R
2
right.
Then
the
Carnot
principles,
we
can
say,
what
are
those?
The
Carnot
principles
are,
there
are
the
efficiency
of
an
irreversible
heat
engine
is
always
less
than
the
efficiency
of
a
reversible
one
operating
between
the
same
two
reservoirs.
Therefore,
we
can
say,
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
always
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible,
right.
Then,
from
the
things,
we
have
already
said,
can
be
taken
as
the
Carnot
principle.
The
efficiencies
of
all
reversible
heat
engines
operating
between
the
same
two
reservoirs,
are
the
same,
that
is,
yeeta thermal reversible ‘A ’ must be yeeta thermal reversible ‘B’.
So,
all
the
efficiencies
of
all
reversible
heat
engines,
operating
between
the
same
two
reservoirs,
are
same,
that
is
yeeta
thermal
reversible
A
must
be
equals
to
yeeta
thermal
reversible
B,
right.
So,
as
many
reversible,
you
take
A,
B,
C,
D,
if
all
are
reversible,
then,
they
will
have
the
same
thermal
efficiency ,
provided,
that
also
has
to
be,
said,
provided
they
are
working
under
the
same
two
reservoirs,
that
is
hot
reservoir ,
and
cold
reservoir .
If
your
hot
reservoir
and
cold
reservoir
are
same,
for
the
two
reversible
engines
their
efficiency
also
will
be
same,
but
if
one
is
this,
hot
reservoir
and
if
this
is
the
cold
reservoir ,
another
hot
reservoir
is
this
and
cold
reservoir
is
this,
then,
obviously ,
if
this
is
R
1,
and
if
this
be
R
2,
they
will
not
be
same,
right.
So,
they
have
to
be
operating
under
the
same
two
identical
reservoirs,
that
is,
hot
and
cold,
then
only,
we
can
say
that,
the
thermal
efficiency
of
the
reversible
engines
will
have
the
same
efficiencies,
right,
as
here,
we
have
showed
as,
A
and
B
right.
Then
third
principle
we
can
say,
so,
both
can
be
determined using the second law right.
Therefore,
we
cannot,
therefore,
both,
rather ,
both
the,
both
can
be
demonstrated
using
the
second
law
and
we
can
say,
the
Carnot
heat
engine
defines
the
maximum
efficiency
and
practical
heat
engine
can
reach
up
to
that.
So,
Carnot
heat
engine
has
given
you
one
maximum
efficiency ,
that
is
yeeta
Carnot
is
max.
You
cannot
go
beyond
that,
at
least
at
the
most,
you
can
reach
up
to
that,
but
you
cannot
go
beyond
that,
that
is,
all
practical
engines,
whatever
engine
you
have,
that
will
have
less
thermal
efficiency
than
that
of
the
Carnot.
So,
we
can
see
that,
both
this
can
be
demonstrated
with
the
second
law,
and
therefore,
the
Carnot
heat
engine
defines,
the
maximum
efficiency ,
any
particular
heat
engine
can
reach
up
to,
or
any
practical
heat
engine
can
reach
up
to
that
limit
right.
Now
the
another
principle
we
can
say
that,
thermal
efficiency
that
is,
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
W
net
over
Q
H,
that
is,
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H,
or
Q
C
over
Q
H,
whatever
you
call,
Q
C
or
Q
L,
there
is,
no,
Q
H
is
hot.
So,
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H
is
a
function
of
T
L
and
T
H,
and
it
can
be
shown
that
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H
and
that
is
equal
to 1 minus T L over T H, and this is called Carnot ef ficiency .
So,
Carnot
efficiency ,
we
can
say
that,
it
is
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H,
and
that
means,
it
is
1
minus
T
L
over
T
H
and
that
means,
it
is
T
H
minus
T
L
over
T
H,
right
this
is
the
Carnot
heat
engine
efficiency ,
right
this
is
called
Carnot
heat
engine
efficiency .
Now
the
last
one,
as
the
principle
of
Carnot,
we
can
say,
for
a
typical,
for
a
typical
steam
power
plant
operating
between
say
T
H
is
equal
to
800
Kelvin,
that
is
boiler ,
and
T
L
is
equal
to
say,
300
Kelvin
for
say,
cooling
tower ,
300
Kelvin,
means
somewhere
27
degree
centigrade,
right.
That
is
300
Kelvin.
So,
it
is
reasonable.
Now
the
maximum
achievable
efficiency
that
you
can
have
is
how
much?
we
have
said,
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H,
right,
then
we
can
also
write
that
yeeta
thermal
is
equals
to
1
minus
T
L
over
sorry
T
this
should
be
written
this
way
that
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
1
minus
T
L
over
T
H.
So,
this
means,
it
is
T
H
minus
T
L
over
T
H,
now
our
T
H
given,
is
800
Kelvin and T L given is 300  Kelvin.
So,
we
can
write
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
800
minus
300
divided
by
800
right.
So,
this
becomes
equal
to
500
divided
by
800.
So,
it
is
5
by
8.
So,
5
by
8
means,
it
is
equal
0.6and 2 that means, 2 right. So, it is 62.5 right, it is 6.625, rather it should  be said.
So,
it
is
0.625
means
62.5
percent.
So,
the
efficiency
has
come
to
62.5
percent.
So,
we
can
now
say
that,
we
have
shown
how
the
efficiency
of
Carnot
reversible
engine
can
be
found
out,
right,
that
is,
1
minus
T
L
over
T
H,
and
that
is
equal
to
T
H
minus
T
L
by
T
H, and one such example we have shown right.
With
this,
we,
our
time
is
up.
So,
we
can
conclude
today
that,
Carnot
efficiency
is
1
minus T L over T H ok.  Thank you.
