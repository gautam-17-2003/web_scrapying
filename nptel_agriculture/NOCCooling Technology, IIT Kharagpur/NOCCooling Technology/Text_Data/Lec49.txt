Condenser
(Contd.)
So,
good
afternoon
my
dear
students
and
friends.
We
are
doing
condenser
and
we
have
done,
though,
it
was,
it
is
not
due
for
condensers,
because,
the
flow
type,
that
comes
under
heat
exchangers,
as
I
told
you
that,
I
will
try
my
best
to
give
you
as
much
information
as
possible.
So,
that
is
why,
the
flow
type,
depending
on
that,
the
heat
exchangers
are
also
different,
that
we
have
already
shown.
Now,
we
come
back
to
condensers,
under
continued
condition
classes,
right.
So,
we
come
to
water
cooled
condensers.
We
come
to
water
cooled
condensers,
and
there
we
can
get
double
tube
type,
shell
and
coil
type,
shell
and
tube
type,
whether,
it
is
horizontal
or
vertical
and
evaporative
condensers,
right.
So,
heat
transfer
related
to
water
cooled
condensers
are
like
this,
similar
to
air
cooled
condenser,
log
mean
temperature
difference
is
still
valid,
since,
it
is
assumed
that
condensation
occurs.
Since,
it
is
assumed
that
condensation
occurs
throughout
the
length
of
the
condenser,
and
refrigerant
temperature
remains
constant,
that
is,
hot
fluid,
if
water,
and
the
refrigerant
are
in
counter
flow.
Then
we
can
write
that
Q
is
equal
to
rather
Q
is
equal
to
U
o
A
o
delta
T
m
which
is
U
o
A
o
delta
T
m,
means
delta
T
2
minus
delta
T
1
over
ln
of
delta
t
2
by
delta
t
1,
or
log
min
temperature
difference,
that
can
be
told
as
delta
T
m,
that
is
delta
T
m,
log
mean
is
delta
T
2
minus
delta
T
1
over
ln
of
delta
t
2
by
delta
t
1
right.
Now,
if
we
see,
obviously,
delta,
this,
I
am
not
going
to
repeat
because
we
have
already
said.

Over
all
heat

coefficient
U

is
where,
A

=
Outside
area
of
water
tube,
A
i
=
inside
area
of
water
tube,
h

and
h

are

and

are

respectively ,
d

is

k
w
is
thermal
conductivity
of

material.
h
o
can
be
obtained
from
heat
transfer
coefficient
for
condensation
outside
horizontal
tube
as:
where,
rf
=
saturated
liquid,
properties
are
evaluated
at
(t
wo
+
t
r
)
/
2;
N
=
average
number
of
tubes
per
column.
Inside
heat
transfer
coefficient
Now,
in
this,
there
is
a
overall
heat
transfer
coefficient,
that
is
U
o,
that
outside
overall
heat
transfer
coefficient,
we
can
say,
that
is
equal
to
1
by
A
o
by
h
i
A
i
plus
A
o
by
A
i
h
d

plus
A
o
by
A
I
into
r

ln
of
d
o
over
d
I,
right,
divided
by
k
w
plus
1
by
h
o.
Similarly,
A
o
is
the
outside
area
of
water
tube,
A
i
is
the
inside
area
of
water
tube,
h
o
and
h
i
are
the
outside
water
tube
and
inside
water
tube
heat
transfer
coefficients,
respectively ,
r
i,
d
i
are
inside
water
tube
radius
and
diameter
respectively ,
d
o
is
outside
water
tube
diameter,
k
w
is
the
thermal
conductivity
of
water
tube
material.
h
o
can
be
obtained
from
heat
transfer
coefficient
for
condensation
outside
horizontal
tube,
and
this
can
be
obtained
as
h
o,
outside
heat
transfer
coefficient,
that
is
0.725
into
this
is
a
relation,
k

to
the
power

rho

g
into
h
fg,
rather,
over
N
into
D
o
into
mu
rf
into
delta
T.
Obviously,
rf
is
the
saturated
liquid
properties,
which
are
calculated
at
the
average
temperature
of
t
wo
and
t
f,
right,
and
N
is
the
average
number
of
tubes
per
column
inside
heat
transfer
coefficient,
and
h
i
can
be
calculated
from
this
Sieder-Tate
equation
for
laminar
flow,
like
N
u
is
equal
to
0.036
R

mu
by
mu
w,
that
is,
the
wall
viscosity
correction
factor,
to
the
power
0.14.
When,
the
flow
is
turbulent,
this
new
average,
which
I
had
given
you
earlier
also,
no
point
of
saying
it
again
here,
because,
we
are
running
out
of
time.
So,
what
we
can
say
that,
cost
of
water,
the
total
running
cost
of
refrigeration
system
is
the
sum
of
the
cost
of
compressor
power
and
the
cost
of
water,
which
includes
the
cost
of
municipal
water,
or
the
cost
of
running
a
cooling
tower.
We
have
seen
that,
the
compressor
power
increases,
as
the
condenser
temperature
or
the
pressure
increases,
for
a
fixed
evaporator
temperature,
water
from
a
cooling
tower
is
usually
available
at
a
fixed
temperature,
which,
is
equal
to
the
wet
bulb
temperature
of
air
plus
the
approach
temperature
of
the
cooling
tower.

Heat

Q
c
=
1.3
X
10
X
(211
/

=
45.7
kW.
This
heat
is
rejected
to
water.
The
temperature
of
water
goes
up
by
7
oC.
The
specific
heat
of
water
is
given
and
hence
the
mass
flow
rate
of
water
can
be
found
out.
Water
passes
through
24
tubes
at
a
time
with
a
mass
flow
rate,
say,
.
Then,
Since,
Reynolds
number
is
greater
than
2300,
hence,
the
flow
is
turbulent
and
the
inside
heat
transfer
coefficient
hi
may
be
found
by
the
Dittus
–
Boelter
equation
The
refrigerant
condenses
outside
the
tubes.
48
tubes
are
in
12
columns.
Hence,
there
are
4
tubes
(48
/
12)
in
each
column.
So,
N
=
4.
As
the
compressor
temperature
increases,
the
overall
log
mean
temperature
increases.
As
a
result
of
a
lower
mass
flow
rate
of
cooling
tower,
or
cooling,
rather,
cooling
water
is
required
as
a
result,
low
mass
flow
rate
is
required.
This
reduces
the
cost
of
water
at
highest
condenser
temperatures,
or
higher
condenser
temperatures.
From
the
figure
of
variation
of
total
running
cost
of
refrigeration
system
with
condensing
pressure
and
hence,
temperatures,
it
can
be
observed
that,
there
is
a
condenser
pressure,
at
which
the
running
cost
is
minimum,
and
it
is
recommended
that
the
system
should
be
run
at
this
pressure.
This
process,
this
poses
there
are
some
problem
during
winter
operations.
The
complete
analysis
of
the
cost
should
include,
the
initial
cost
of
the
whole
system,
the
interest
on
capital,
the
depreciation,
the
maintenance
cost,
the
operator
cost,
and
so
on.
The
final
selection
of
the
system
and
the
operating
conditions
should
be
such
that
the
cost
is
less
over
the
running
life
of
the
system.
Now,
this
could
have
been
an
assignment,
but,
you
have
seen,
right,
hopefully,
you
have
taken
a
picture,
and
this
is
the
properties,
values,
so
you
can
find
out
the
problem
solution.
I
am
not
going
to
it.
Yes,
here,
I
have
also
given
the
answer,
obviously,
and
you
have
seen,
how
we
have
done
this,
and
please,
you
do
it
at
your
home,
right.
This
is,
I
am
not
repeating.
Prandtl
number,
Nusselt
number,
then,
internal
heat
transfer
coefficient,
all
these,
we
have
formulated,
we
have
calculated
outside
heat
transfer
coefficient,
that
also,
we
have
found
out,
and
ultimately,
we
have
come
to
some
solution.
Now,
very
quickly,
we
shall
go
to
the
extension
of
the
surface,
right,
this
is
part
of,
this
is
not
there,
in
the
condenser,
but
this
may
be
both,
in
the
condenser,
as
well
as
the
evaporator ,
that
is
why,
it
is,
its
function
is
that,
if
it
is
a
condenser
tube,
and
if
the
area,
by
chance,
you
are
not
able
to
improve,
then,
what
you
do,
you
add
some
surface,
like
this,
and
the
area
of
heat
transfer
is
increased,
that
is
why,
this
extension
of
the
area,
to
know,
it
is
very
important,
and
that
is
why,
I
have
not
left
it,
I
have
included
it
in
this.
So
that,
you
know,
this
is
true
for
both
condenser
as
well
as
evaporator ,
this
is
more
likely
to
do
in
evaporator ,
than
that
of
the
condenser,
but
still,
I
am
continuing
it,
because,
it
is
useful
for
both,
ok.
So,
here,
we
have
taken
one
pictorial
view,
not
pictorial,
this
is
a
schematic
drawing,
where,
as
you
see
that,
the
surface,
as
you
see
that,
this
is
the
main
thing,
right.
This
is
the
main
thing,
and
here,
we
are
extending
the
area
by
this,
right
we
are
extending
this
area,
this
is
a
rectangular
piece,
but,
we
have
also
done
for
the
cylindrical
piece,
right.
So,
for
both
the
things,
what
is
the
base,
there
are
some
preconditions,
like,
temperature
is
a
function
of
x,
or
rather,
yes,
it
is
a
function
of
x,
here,
x
is
the
distance
of
the
fin,
right
and
we
have
taken
a
small
volume
of
that,
where,
the
thickness
of
the
fin
is
‘t’,
and
the
length
is
delta
x,
in
the
direction
of
x,
right,
which,
has
a
perimeter
of
p,
and
a
cross
sectional
area
of
A,
and
the
base
is
always
at
T
0
temperature
base,
means,
where,
it
is
connected,
right,
this
is
the
fin,
and
this
is
the
wall,
or
whatever.
So,
it
is
connected
there,
if
it
is
a
tube,
then,
this,
the
base
is
this
one,
right,
like,
if
this
is
the
extended
surface,
this,
one,
then,
this
is
the
base,
ok.
Then,
what
we
do,
we
solve
it,
with
an
assumption,
that
it
is
one
dimensional
steady
state
heat
transfer
for
fins
of
uniform
cross
section,
and
the
governing
energy
equation
is
like
this,
that,
the
net
rate
of
heat
gain
by
conduction
in
x
direction,
into
volume
element
delta
x,
plus
net
rate
of
heat
gain
by
convection
through
internal
surfaces,
into
volume
element
delta
x,
is
equal
to
0
right.
Then,
we
can
say
that,
the
net
gain
by
convection,
is
one,
which,
we
have
denoted,
that
is,
minus
d
dx
of
q
A
into
delta
x,
right,
that
is
equal
to
k
A
d
2
T
x
dx
square,
by
defining
q
as
minus
k
A
d
T
dx,
right.
So,
it
becomes
k
A
d
2
T
x
dx
square
into
delta
x,
and
net
heat
gain
by
convection,
that
can
be
written
as
h
into
T
e
minus
T
x
into
p
into
delta
x,
right,
where,
the
cross
sectional
area
A,
the
perimeter,
p
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
h,
and
the
thermalconductivity
of
the
fin
material
k
are
constant.
So,
therefore,
the
governing
equation
can
be
written
as
d
2
T
x
dx
square
minus
h
p
over
A
k
into
T
x
minus
T
e,
this
is
equal
to
0
right.
So,
this
can
be
rearranged
in
a
more
compact
form
as,
d
2
theta
x
dx
square
minus
m
square
theta
x
is
equal
to
0,
where,
of
course,
m
square
is
equal
to
h
p
by
A
k
and
theta
x
is
equal
to
T
x
minus
T
e,
i.e.,
T
at
any
position
x
minus
T
e,
that
is
environmental
temperature,
right.
So,
this
equation
that,
d
2
theta
x
dx
square
minus
m
square
theta
x
is
equal
to
0,
this
is
known
as
one
dimensional
fin
equation
for
fins
of
uniform
cross
section
and
is
a
linear,
homogeneous,
second
order,
ordinary
differential
equation,
with
constant
coefficients.
Then,
the
general
solution
of
this
kind
of
equation
A
is,
theta
x
equal
to
c
1,
e
to
the
power
minus
m
x
plus
c
2,
e
to
the
power
m
x.
This
is
true
for
long
fins,
and
it
may
have
other
solutions
also,
for
example,
we
can
write
that
theta
x
is
c
1
cos
hyperbolic
m
x
plus
c
2
sin
hyperbolic
m
x
,or
theta
x
is
equal
to
c
1
cos
hyperbolic
m
l
minus
x
plus
c
2
sin
hyperbolic
m
l,
rather,
sin
hyperbolic
m
l
minus
x,
for
fins
with
finite
length.
To
determine
the
constants
c
1
and
c
2
obviously,
we
need
two
boundary
conditions.
So,
one
at
the
fin
base,
and
another
at
the
fin
tip,
and
these
two
boundary
conditions
are
required
to
be
known.
Customarily ,
the
temperature
at
the
fin
base
is
known,
and
this
is
taken
as,
at
x
is
equal
to
0,
this
is
considered
to
be
known.
Then,
we
can
write,
the
fin
base
condition
is
theta
0
is
equal
to
T
0
minus
T
e,
and
that
is
equal
to
theta
0,
theta
at
any
position
0
is
equal
to
0,
that
is,
what
theta
0,
equals
to
T
0
minus
T
e,
and
that
is
equal
to
theta
0,
where
obviously,
T
0
is
the
fin
base
temperature.
Several
different
conditions
may
arise
such
as,
number
1,
long
fin,
that
is,
the
fin
is
very
long,
like
this,
if
the
base,
and
if
it
is
the
fin.
So,
it
is
a
long
fin,
and
negligible
heat
loss
from
the
fin
tip,
what
is
that,
this
is
the
base,
this
is
the
fin.
So,
the
negligible
heat
loss
at
the
fin
tip,
this
is
the
fin
tip,
right
and
convection
at
the
fin
tip,
third
one
is,
it
could
be
on
a
convective
condition
at
the
fin
tip
right.
So,
if
we
take
it
first,
that
the
long
fin.
So,
for
a
sufficiently
long
fin,
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
temperature
at
the
tip
of
the
fin
approaches
the
temperature
T
e
of
the
surrounding
fluid.
So,
this
is
the
long
fin,
surrounding
fluid
is
this,
it
has
a
heat
transfer
coefficient
of
say,
h
or
he,
whatever
you
call,
and
it
has
a
temperature
also,
as
T
e.
So,
this
fin
tip,
if
it
is
a
long
fin,
will
get
the
temperature
of
the
surrounding
T
e,
and
that
is
the
nature
of
the
long
fin,
right.
Then,
the
mathematical
formulation
for
one
dimensional
steady
state
heat
transfer
in
a
long
fin
that
can
be
written
as,
d
2
theta
x
d
x
square
minus
m
square
theta
x,
that
is
equal
to
0,
where
x
is
greater
than
0.
Therefore,
we
can
write,
theta
x,
as
it
tends
to
0,
is
rather
tends
to
0,
at
x
tends
to
infinity,
right.
So,
we
can
write
that,
m
square
is
equal
to
p
h
over
A
k
right.
So,
we
take
the
solution
in
the
form
that,
theta
x
is
equal
to
c
1
e
to
the
power
minus
m
x
plus
c
2
e
tothe
power
m
x.
Then
applying
the
boundary
conditions,
typically,
the
second
one,
first
we
get
c
2
is
equal
to
0,
and
applying
the
first
boundary
condition,
we
get
c
1
is
equal
to
theta
0,
right.
And
this
we
can
write,
the
solution
of
the
differential
equation,
that
can
be
written
as
theta
x
over
theta
0,
that
is,
T
x
minus
T
e
over
T
0
minus
T
e
equals
to
e
to
the
power
minus
m
x.
Though,
the
heat
flow
through
the
fin,
that
can
be
determined
as,
ok.
The
previous
equation,
we
can
write
that
theta
x
is
equal
to
theta
0
into
e
to
the
power
minus
m
x.
Then,
the
heat
flow
through
the
fin,
that
can
be
determined,
either
by
integrating
the
convective
heat
transfer
curve
over
the
entire
fin
surface
as
Q
equals
to
x
equals
to
0
to
x
equals
to
L,
h
p
theta
x
d
x
by
integration
of
this,
or
by
evaluating
the
heat
flow,
at
the
fin
base,
as
Q
equals
to
minus
A
k
d
theta
x
d
x
is
equal
to
at
x,
is
equal
to
0,
right.
Then,
we
can
obviously,
get
the
results
from
both
these
two,
they
are
identical,
and
since,
heat
flow
through
the
lateral
surface
by
convection
is
equal
to
the
heat
flow
at
the
fin
base
by
conduction.
Assuming
the
conduction
equation
and
with
the
help
of
temperature
distribution
obtained
as
theta
x.
We
can
write,
the
heat
flow
through
the
fin
as
Q
equals
to
A
k
theta
0
m
and
that
is
equal
to
theta
0
under
root
p
h
k
A
1
because
m
we
have
already
defined
as
m
square
is
equal
to
p
h
by
A
k.
So,
m
is
under
root
p
h
over
A
k
right.
Therefore,
the
second
thing
is
that
fins
with
negligible
heat
loss
at
the
tip.
So,
heat
transfer
area
at
the
fin
tip
is
generally
small
compared
with
the
lateral
area
of
the
fin
for
heat
transfer.
Under
this
conditions
or
situations,
the
heat
loss
from
the
fin
tip
is
negligible
compared
with
that
from
the
multilateral
surfaces.
And
the
boundary
condition
at
the
fin
tip,
characterizing
the
situation
can
be
taken
as
d
theta
d
x
is
equal
to
0
at
x
is
equal
to
L.
The
mathematical
formulation
of
the
fin
problem,
this
can
be
written
as
d
2
theta
x
d
x
square
minus
m
square
theta
x
is
equal
to
0,
valid
between
x
less
than
equals
to
0
less
than
equals
to
L.
So,
fins
with,
we
can
say,
the
boundary
conditions
could
be
theta
x
is
equal
to
T
0
minus
T
e
at
x
is
equal
to
0,
equal
to
theta
0,
and
d
theta
x
d
x
is
0,
at
x
equals
to
L.
So,
let
us
choose
the
solution
in
the
form,
theta
x
is
equal
to
c
1
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x
plus
c
2
sin
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x.
So,
by
applying
the
two
boundary
conditions,
we
get
c
2
is
0,
and
c
1
is
theta
0
over
cos
hyperbolic
m
L.
So,
the
solution
can
be
rewritten
as
theta
x
over
theta
0,
is
equal
to
T
x
minus
T
e
over
T
0
minus
T
e,
is
equal
to
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x
by
cos
hyperbolic
m
L.
And,
the
heat
flow
rate
Q
through
the
fin,
that
can
be
written,
equals
to
Q
is
equal
to
A
k
theta
0
m
tan
hyperbolic
m
L
is
equal
to
theta
0
under
root
p
h
k
A
tan
hyperbolic
m
L.
Now,
if
m
L
is
sufficiently
large,
then,
tan
hyperbolic
m
L
tends
to
1,
right.
So,
as
a
limiting
one,
this
can
be
used,
right.
So,
where
m
L
is
very
high.
Now,
the
third
one
is
thefin
with
convection
at
the
tip,
most
realistic
boundary
is
this
one,
and
the
mathematical
formulation
we
can
write,
d
2
theta
x
d
x
square
minus
m
square
theta
x
is
0
valid
between,
x
0
to
x
L,
and
theta
x
is
T
e
T
0
minus
T
e
equal
to
theta
0,
at
x
is
equal
to
0,
and
k
d
2
theta
d
theta
x
d
x
plus
h
e
theta
x
is
equal
to
0
at
x
is
equal
to
L.
Again,
if
we
take
the
solution,
in
the
form
theta
x,
is
equal
to
c
1
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x
plus
c
2
sin
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x,
then
we
can
write,
the
application
of
the
boundary
condition,
that
can
be
written
as
theta
0
is
c
1
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
plus
c
2
sin
hyperbolic
m
L
and
minus
k
c
2
m
plus
h
e
c
1
is
equal
to
0.
Now,
since
d
theta
d
x
at
x
is
equal
to
L
equals
to
minus
c
1
m
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x
minus
c
2
m
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x,
at
x
is
equal
to
L.
So,
this
is
equal
to
theta
2
m.
So,
by
determining
the
constants
c
1
and
c
2
and
replacing
them
into
this
solution,
the
temperature
distribution
in
the
fin
that
becomes
equal
to
theta
x
over
theta
0
equal
to
T
x
minus
T
e
by
T
0
minus
T
e
and
this
is
equal
to
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x
plus
h
e
by
m
k
sin
hyperbolic
m
L
minus
x
over
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
plus
h
e
over
m
k
sin
hyperbolic
m
L
and
the
heat
flow
rate
through
the
fin
is
Q
equal
to
theta
0
under
root
p
h
k
A
into
sin
hyperbolic
m
L
plus
h
e
by
m
k
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
over
cos
hyperbolic
m
L
plus
h
e
by
m
k
sin
hyperbolic
m
L.
Now,
if
h
e
equals
to
0,
then
it
corresponds
to
nothing,
but,
heat
loss,
no,
heat
loss
from
the
tip,
right.
So,
this
is
a
limiting
condition
right.
So,
there
are
some
solutions.
I
am
not
going
to
do
this
now
because
fin
efficiency,
obviously
is
q
fin
over
q
ideal,
and
that
we
can
again
leave
it,
right.
This
is
how
another
pictorial
view,
I
would
like
to
show
that
under
different
conditions
of
the
fins,
how
it
looks
like,
and
how
the
surface
area
of
fin
heat
transfer
coefficient
and
theta
0
that
is
T
0
minus
T
infinity,
this
is
plotted
versus
L
under
root
2
h
over
k
t,
right
fin
efficiency.
Another
thing,
the
last
thing,
one
is
obviously
this,
that
was
for
that
was,
for
rectangular ,
or
a
pointed
fin
fins,
this
is
for
circular
fins,
right
and
we
can
find
out
the
q,
right.
Now,
one
thing
is
very
certain,
why
we
have
taken
k
2
k
t
2
over
k
rather
2
k
over
t
over
h
right.Therefore,
from
the
q
fin,
theta
0
under
root
p
h
A
k
tan
hyperbolic
m
L
and
q
ideal
is
p
L
h
theta
0,
we
can
write
yeeta,
that
is
fin
efficiency,
equals
to
theta
0
under
root
p
h
A
k
tan
hyperbolic
m
L
over
theta
0
p
L
h
that
is,
tan
hyperbolic
m
L
over
m
L,
where,
m
L
is
L
under
root
p
h
over
A
k,
and
that
is
for
plate,
it
is
L
2
h
over
k
t
right
p
a
by
a
is
2
by
T,
T
being
the
fin
thickness
this
is
why
fin
efficiency
is
plotted
against
L
under
root
2
h
over
k
T
right.
So,
this
is
how
we
have
shown
that
why
the
fin
efficiency
is
plotted
against
L
under
root
2
h
by
k
t,
ok.
This
is
the
completion
of
condenser,
we
will
come
next
with
