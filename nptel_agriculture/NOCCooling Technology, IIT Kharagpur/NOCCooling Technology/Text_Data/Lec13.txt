Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
Good
morning.
Hopefully ,
you
have
gone
through
the
previous
class
where
we
stated
about
the
thermodynamic
equilibrium
as
well
we
said
about
the
laws
of
thermodynamics.
We
said
there
are
4
laws,
zeroth
law,
first
law,
second
law
and
third
law
and
we
said
also
that
zeroth
law
deals
with
temperature,
first
law
deals
with
internal
energy,
second
law
deals
with
entropy ,
and
the
third
law
deals
with
the
absolute
zero
cannot
be
achieved
right.
So,
out
of
which,
we
finished
perhaps
the
zeroth
law,
and
we
said
in
subsequent
classes
we
will
go
to
first,
second,
third,
all
these
laws
and
from
there
we
will
also
find
out
some
other
properties,
which
we
have
not
said
as
of
now.
Now ,
this
is
again
continuation
of
the
basics
of
thermodynamics,
it
will
take
a
little
time.
As
I
said
earlier ,
and then we come to the first law right.
We
come
to
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
after
zeroth
law.
So,
if
some
heat
or
work
is
added
to
a
system
or
removed
from
the
system
either
adding
or
removing.
So,
if
we
do
that,
then
none
of
this
is
created
or
destroyed
in
the
system
right.
So,
according
to
this
law,
perpetual
motion
machine,
perpetual
motion
machine
of
the
first
kind,
which
can
be,
which
can
be
abbreviated
as
PMM,
is
impossible
right,
perpetual
motion
of
the
first
kind
is impossible.
You
have
seen
the
toys
during
your
childhood
right.
So,
in
that
toys
what
did
you
do?
Say,
if
it
is
the
toy
then
you
put
some
spring
and
give
with
the
key
something,
right
and
the
toy,
say,
if
it
is
a,
if
it
is
a
car,
then,
it
goes
on,
right
and
you
are
happy ,
but
it
goes
on
till
when
you
had
given
the
energy,
by,
in
the
form
of
that
key
right.
So,
it
cannot
be
that,
after
that,
it
will
also
go
on
running,
that
is
what
is
the
perpetual
motion
of
first
kind
and
this
is
impossible.
So,
in
other
words
it
can
be
also
said
that
heat
and
work
these
are
inter
convertible.
So,
heat
can
be
converted
to
work
or
work
can
be
also
converted
to
heat
and
this
is
governed
by
the
equation
that
is
called
dU
is
equal
to
dq
or
dU
is
equal
to
dQ
minus  dW , right.
So,
that
d
is
small,
by
chance,
it
has,
it
has
come
capital
and
many
cases
you
know ,
nowadays,
systems
do
change
according
to
is
wish.
So,
might
be
it
was
not
properly
looked
into.
So,
this
is
dw.
So,
dq
is
equal
to
dU
minus
dw
this
is
the
first
law,
right
andthis
means,
if
work
is
done
by
the
system,
which
is
considered
to
be
positive,
as
we
said
in
earlier
class,
and
that
is
dw
positive,
the
internal
energy
dU
will
decrease,
since,
work
will
be
done
at
the
expense
of
this
internal,
energy
right.
So,
in
other
words
we
can
also
say
that
if
dq
amount
of
heat
is
transferred
to
the
system,
which
is
considered
to
be
positive, as we said, this is positive, then internal ener gy dU will  increase.
U
2
– U
1
= Q
1-2
– W
1-2
This
means,
internal
energy
increases,
if
heat
is
transferred
to
the
system
or
work
is
done
on
the
system,
either
heat
is
transferred
to
the
system
or
work
is
done
on
the
system
then
internal
energy
is
increasing
right.
Of
course,
internal
energy,
means
the
sum
of
all
total
energies,
total
of
all
forms
of
the
energy,
such
as
it
can
be
nuclear ,
it
can
be
atomic,
it
can
be
molecular ,
it
can
be
vibrational,
it
can
be
rotational,
it
can
be
lattice,
or
thermal,
etc,
as
many
you
can,
all
forms
of
energy
together
is
giving
you
the
internal
energy
right.
So,
we
have
come
to
know
that
dq
is
equal
to
dU
minus
dw
right.
Then
if
the
initial
state
for
a
closed
system
be
1
with
an
internal
energy
of
U
and
if
q
1
to
2
right,
q
1
to
2,
this
is,
that
is
state
point
1
to
state
point
2,
q
1
to
2
in
kilojoules
of
the
heat
is
transferred
across
its
boundary
then,
w
1
to
2,
w
1
to
w
2
kilojoules
of
work
is
done
by
the
system
reaching
at
an
equilibrium
state
of
2,
from
state
point
1
to
state
point
2
right.
And,
in
that
case,
we can say that u 2 minus u 1,  is equal  to q 1 to 2 minus  w 1 to 2.
So,
if
m
dot
is
the
mass
of
the
system
or
m
is
the
mass
of
the
system,
m
dot
normally
used
for
rate,
any
rate
means,
per
unit
time.
So,
here
if
it
is
mass
flow
rate
then
m
dot,
but
if
it
is
mass
of
the
system
m
is
the
mass
of
the
system
and
u
denotes
the
specific
internal
energy
again
whenever
the
word
specific
will
be
used,
it
is
normally
per
unit
mass,
right
specific
energy,
specific,
any
other
thing
that
will
be
per
unit
mass
right.
So,
u
denotes,
small
u
denotes
specific
internal
energy
of
the
system
in
kilojoules
per
kg,
then
m
into
u
2
minus
u
1
is
equal
to
q
1
to
2
minus
w
1
to
2
right.
It
is
per
unit
mass,
right
or
if
it
is
divided,
no
this
is
not
per
unit,
this
is
the
whole
right
and
by
chance
it
was
a
capital
U
and
this
is
also
capital
U,
U
2
minus
U
1
conventionally
like
this
Q
is
capital,
this
W
is
capital,
conventionally ,
when
it
is
for
the
total
mass
then,
it
is
capital
when
it
is
per
unit
mass,
then
it
is
small
this
is
by
convention,
right.
So,
we
can
write
that
m
into
U
2
minus
U
1,
this
u's
are
capital
is
equal
to
Q
1
to
2
minus
W
1
to
2,
or
we
can
also
say
that u 2 minus u 1 small is equal to q 1 to 2 small  and minus w 1 to 2, small, right.
So,
where
this
q
1
to
2
or
w
1
to
2,
that
heat
and
work,
heat
transfer
and
work
done
per
unit
mass
of
the
system,
that
is
what
I
said
that
when
it
is
in
small
letter ,
then
it
is
per
unit
mass,
but
when
it
is
in
capital
letter ,
then
it
is
the
total
mass,
or
for
the
total
mass,
we
should
say,
right.
So,
we
got
u
2
minus
u
1
is
equal
to
q
1
to
2
minus
w
1
to
2.
Now
this
is
an
open
system
right.
So,
we
have
v
1
A
1
right
v
1
into
A
1
v
is
the
velocity
in
meter
per
second
and
A
is
the
area
in
meter
square
right.
So,
it
is
meter
cube
per
second
that is volumetric flow  right.
So,
that
is
volume
flow.
So,
if
we
know
that
v
1
into
A
1
is
equal
to
m
dot
into
v
1
that
is
m
dot
is
again
mass
per
second
or
sorry
this
is
only
mass
into
into
v
is
meter
per
second
right
or
mass
is
kg.
So,
that
becomes
kg
meter
per
second
right.
So,
if
this
quantity
of
the
system,
your
system
is
coming
here
in
a
time
delta
t,
right
in
a
time
delta
t
through
the
area
A
1
from
the
state
point
1
through
the
open
system
at
a
velocity
v
1
at
a
pressure
of
p
1
coming
to
the
state
point
2
where
the
velocity
is
v
2
right
rate
of
flow
of
work
is
equal
to
d
w
d
t
and
that
is
m
p
v
1
under
the
area
A
2,
then
we
can
say
work
done
in
time
delta
t
is,
d
w
and
that
is
equal
to
force
into
distance
and
that
can
be
equated
to
p
1
A
1
into
v
1
del
t
right
or
we
can
write
p
1
A
1
v
1
del
t,
that
is
the
work
done
in
time
delta
t,
right.
Now ,
another
thermodynamic
property
comes
up,
that
is
called
enthalpy ,
of
course,
we
know ,
it
is
not
that
you
may
not
know ,
but
you
may
be
knowing that enthalpy .
So,
enthalpy
is
the
combining
specific
flow
work
that
is
p
1
v
1
with
internal
energy
u
1
at
the
inlet
and
subsequently
at
the
outlet,
we
can
get
enthalpy
h,
by
convention
enthalpy
is
used
either
small
h,
or
capital
H
right
by
convention
it
is
used
either
small
h
or
capital
H.
So,
H
is
equal
to
u
plus
p
v
right.
So,
H
is
equal
to
u
plus
p
v
therefore,
for
an
open
system,
where
flow
of
work
is
to
be
included,
enthalpy
is
considered
in
place
of
internal
energy,
H
is
equal
to
u
plus
p
v,
keep
in
mind
right,
Subsequently
we
will
be
using
at
many
places.
So,
where
we
may
not
be
able
to
trace
back
or
go
back.
Now
after
the
first
law
we
come
to
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
and
in
that
we
start
with
Clausius
statement right.
What
is
Clausius
statement?
It
is
saying,
it
is
impossible,
it
is
impossible
to
transfer
heat
in
a
cyclic
process,
from
low
temperature
to
high
temperature
without
work
from
an
external
source.
It
is
impossible
for
water
to
flow
from
a
low
height
to
an
upper
height
without
any
external
source,
like
pump
right.
So,
the
same
thing
is
being
said
that,
it
is
impossible
to
transfer
heat
in
a
cyclic
process
from
low
temperature
to
high
temperature
without
any
external
source.
All
the
energy
supplied
to
a
system
as
work,
can
be
dissipated
as
heat
all
the
energy
supplied
as
heat,
but,
it
cannot
be
continuously
converted
to
work
with
a
thermal
efficiency
of
100
percent.
All
the
work
can
be
dissipated
as
heat,
but
all
the
energy
supplied
that
heat
cannot
be
continuously
converted
to work  with a thermal ef ficiency at 100 percent.Otherwise,
an
automobile
will
run
by
driving
energy
from
atmosphere,
or
a
ship
can
flow
or
propel
itself
by
deriving
energy
from
the
ocean
right.
So,
what
Clausius
statement
is
saying,
that
you
can
convert
heat
to
work
with
100
percent,
but
the
reverse
work
to
heat
even
the
efficiency
is
100
percent
cannot
be
achieved
or
cannot
be
done,
that
is
the
prime
thing
which
the
Clausius
statement
is
describing
right.
Example
is
given
as
otherwise
automobile
would
have
used
air
from
atmosphere
as
the
source
of
energy
and
it
would
have
been
continuously
flowing
or
say,
ship
could
propel
using
the
ocean
as
the ener gy source. So, these  are not possible. So, that is what Clausius is saying.
We
can
convert
heat
to
work
completely ,
but
work
to
heat
completely
is
not
possible
right.
So,
this
leads
to
a
hypothetical
machine
of
perpetual
motion
of
second
kind
that
is
what
is
the
statement,
that
perpetual
motion
of
second
kind
is
impossible
right.
That
means,
that
all
the
time
you
will
be
moving
without
any
support
of
energy
that
is
not
possible.
Then
another
great
scientist
or
not
a,
other
scientists,
they
said,
that
is,
Kelvin
and
Planck,
they
said
that,
it
is
impossible
to
construct
a
device
or
engine,
operating
in
a
cycle,
that
will
produce
no
effect
other
than
extraction
of
heat
from
a
single
reservoir
and
convert
all
of
heat
into
work.
I
repeat
it,
they
said,
it
is
impossible
to
construct
a
device
or
engine
operating
in
a
cyclic
process
that
will
produce
no
effect
other
than
extraction
of heat from single reservoir and convert all of heat into work.
This
means
the
higher
the
temperature
of
the
heat
source
and
the
lower
the
temperature
of
this,
heat
sink,
that
is
surrounding
the
higher
will
be
the
efficiency
right,
but
is
it
possible
that
in
one
side
you
think
that
you
have
1000
degree
centigrade
and
any
another
side
you
have
minus
100
degree
centigrade
even
then
that
you
can
convert
is
it
possible
perhaps
not
right.
So,
this
is
what
Kelvin
Planck
said.
Now
this
brings
us
to
another
concept
that
is
called
reversible
and
irreversible
process
right.
Reversible
and
irreversible
process.
By
simple
logic
we
know
this
is
a
irreversible
sign
whereas,
this
is
to
be
a
reversible sign right.
Yes,
if
we
know
the
sign
of
reversibility
or
irreversibility ,
but
what
is
that
let
us
say.
We
say
that,
a
process
is
reversible
with
respect
to
the
system
and
surroundings
if
the
system
and
the
surrounding
can
be
reversed
to
their
respective
initial
state.
So,
if
we
start
from
this
point
1
and
come
to
the
point
2
by
this
process
now
if
I
can
go
back
to
state
point
1
then
only
we
can
say
that
this
is
a
reversible
process.
We
started
with
this,
we
came
to
this,
and
we
returned
to
the
same
point
then
it
is
a
reversible
process,
but
if
it
is
not
that
if
we
are
not
able
to
go
back
to
point
1
then
we
call
it
to
be
irreversible
right.
Then
a
process
is
reversible
with
respect
to
the
system
and
surroundings,
if
the
system
and
the
surrounding
can
be
reversed
to
their
respective
initial
state
by
reversing
the
direction
of
the process that is by reversing  the direction of heat transfer and work transfer .The
process
is
irreversible
if
it
cannot
adhere
to
this
criteria
right.
Then
we
come
to
another
very
important
one
that
is
which
you
are
saying
about
the
entropy .
Now
you
look
at
if
q
1
to
2
is
heat
transferred
that
q
1
to
2
is
heat
transferred
and
W
1
to
2
is
work
done
on
the
system
it
will
move
from
initial
state
point
of
1
to
a
state
point
of
2.
The
internal
energy
of
the
system
will
change
from
u
1
to
u
2
such
that
u
2
minus
u
1
is
equal
to
q
1
to
2
plus
W
1
to
2.
Now
if
the
signs
of
q
1
to
2
and
W
1
to
2
are
reversed
the
internal
energy will change from u 2 to u 1.
However ,
the
system
will
not
come
back
to
the
point
1
right
the
system
will
not
come
back
to
the
point
1.
And
this
is
why
we
develop
another
parameter
which
is
the
entropy .
So,
it
will
not
come
back
to
point
1
unless
the
heat
and
work
transfer
are
reversible.
The
first
law
is
valid
however ,
during
the
irreversible
process
1
to
2
the
description
of
state
point
2
is
not
complete.
Something
has
changed
so
that
we
cannot
bring
back
the
system
to state point 1 by reversing  the sign.
So,
reversing
the
signs
of
both
heat
and
work
transfer .
So,
this
is
not
reflected
by
internal
energy,
hence,
a
property
is
required
to
give
the
measure
of
this
irreversibility
right,
and
that
is
done
by
the
property
called
entropy ,
right.
Since
we
are
not
able
to
go
back
by
reversing
both
the
heat
and
work
transfer
to
the
state
point
1
to
2
and
back
to
1,
since
it
is
not,
if
it
is
possible
then
it
is
reversible.
If
it
is
not
possibility ,
if
it
is
going
somewhere
else,
then
we
call
it
to
be
irreversible,
and
since,
it
is
not
possible
with
the
help
of
internal
energy
only
to
explain,
this
by
reversing
the
heat
and
work
transfer ,
we
are
not
able
to
reach
to
state
point
1
and
that
can
be
explained
with
the
help
of
a
new
property ,
called
entropy
right.
So,
we
have
come
across
with
a
new
property
that
is
called entropy right.
So,
let
us
stop
today
here
and
next
day
we
will
start
using
the
entropy
for
maybe
the
Carnot cycle ok. Thank you.
