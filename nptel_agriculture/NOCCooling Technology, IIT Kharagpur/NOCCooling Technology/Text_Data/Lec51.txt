Good
afternoon,
my
dear
students,
my
dear
colleagues,
my
dear
friends.
As
you
have
seen
that
we
are
in
the
very
last
phase
of
the
entire
course,
we
have
2
more
weeks
left
and
we
said
that
in
these
2
weeks,
we
will
try
to
maximize
the
application
side,
right.
Because,
we
have
already
produced
cooling,
now ,
we
have
said
in
the
beginning
that,
why
cooling
is
needed,
as
you
see
this
cool
technology
why
and
how
utilized
in
food.
So,
in
that
why ,
the
cooling
is
required,
we
have
said,
how
cooling
is
produced,
we
have
said,
now
how
it
can
be
applied,
right.
So,
this
is
the
third
part.
So,
in
that
third
part,
we
start
with
a
very
very
common
thing,
which
most
of
you,
those
who
do
boozing,
of
course,
seniors
not
the
juniors.
So,
they
know
that,
they
need
the
chunks
of
ice,
right,
and
this
chunks
of
ice,
they
got
from
water ,
keeping
it
in
the
deep
freezer ,
right.
Now ,
the
same
thing
happens,
when
it
is
also
with
the
food
system,
right.
So,
because,
our
course
title
says
that
it
is
utilized
in
food.
So,
we
will
also,
we
have
to
talk
about
the
food,
also
its
application
in
food.
So,
if
you
look
at
the
first
thing,
that
is,
technology
of
preservation
of
food
by
freezing,
in
one
go,
it
could
be
managed,
right.
Now ,
freezing
preservation,
let
us
tell
some
preliminary
things,
like
it
is
ef fective
for
retaining
colour ,
flavour
and
nutritive
value
and
moderately
ef fective
for
retention
of
texture.
W e
have
not
said
in
this
course,
but
in
our
another
course,
if
you
look
at
in
NPTEL,
it
is
there,
freezing
vis-a-vis
cooling,
that
is,
vis-a-vis
high
temperature
or
heating,
right.
So,
if
you
keep
both
in
comparison,
then
if
it
is
high
temperature,
and
if
it
is
low
temperature,
the
ener gy
requirement
for
the
high
temperature
is
more
compared
to
that
for
the
low
temperature.
Number
one,
that
is
the
prime
thing
that
you
need
more
ener gy ,
right.
And
the
quality
of
the
product,
which
is
obtained
in
heating,
and
the
quality
of
the
product
which
is
obtained
in
cooling,
or
at
the
end
freezing.
Freezing
quality
is
much
better
than
that
of
the
heating,
right.
So,
that
is
why ,
it
is
being
claimed
that,
it
is
very
ef fective,
for
retaining
colour ,
flavour ,
nutritive
value
and
moderately
ef fective
for
retaining
texture.
Why
we
are
saying,
we
will
come
to
that
afterwards,
that
we
will
come
to
that,
afterwards,
that
moderately
ef fective
for
retaining
the
texture.
Freezing
process,
temperature
of
product
is
reduced
to
minus
18
degree
centigrade
or
below
andcrystallization
of
the
part
of
water
and
some
of
solutes
take
place.
I
said
in
earlier
class,
that
minus
18,
hopefully ,
you
remember
that,
it
is
equivalent
to
0
Fahrenheit,
not
exactly
equivalent
to
0
Fahrenheit,
is
somewhere
minus
17
point
something,
decimal.
So,
that
is
rounded
up
to
minus
18,
that
is
why
minus
18
is
taken
as
a
datum
for
low
temperature.
Now ,
another
thing,
which
we
are
saying,
that
super
cooled
or
under
cooled,
that
is
temperature
of
water
is
lowered
below
its
freezing
point.
W e
know ,
water
freezes
at
0
degree
centigrade,
this
we
know ,
perhaps,
nowadays,
it
is
also
being
said
in
the
preschool,
when
children
are
around
1.5
to
2
or
2.5
year
old,
right.
So,
it
is
freezing
at
0
degree
centigrade,
universally
we
know ,
but
if
it
under goes
super
cooling
or
under
cooling
below
its
freezing
point
without
any
occurrence
of
crystallization
and
hence
no
impairment
of
food
quality
then,
we
can
say
that,
if
there
be
any
change
during
freezing
then
it
cannot
be
attributed
to
the
temperature.
T emperature
is
not
the
culprit,
culprit
is
somewhere
something,
somebody
else,
and
that
is
the
water
to
ice
transformation
is
the
culprit,
for
any
reduction
in
quality ,
right.
This
we
have
to
keep
in
mind.
Now ,
as
we
said
that,
water
freezes
at
0
degree
centigrade,
but
there
are
many
food
materials,
whose
initial
freezing
point
is
less
than
0
degree.
One
example
is
ice
cream
which
has
a
freezing
point
of
minus
2.5.
So,
which
it
is
getting
frozen
it
is
water
which
is
getting
transformed
into
ice
in
ice
cream
also.
So,
that
means,
it
is
not
universal
that,
water
freezes
at
0
degree
centigrade.
Scientists
have
made
water
as
liquid
water ,
even
at
much
lower
temperature.
If
you
just
Google
that,
what
is
the
minimum
temperature
scientists
have
achieved
till
date,
keeping
water
as
liquid,
no
transformation
of
water
to
ice
then,
you
will
also
get,
it
is
not
0,
somewhere
much
lower
than
that,
right.
This,
I
am
not
able
to
give
you,
that
reference
of
the
Google.
So,
that
is
why ,
I
am
saying
that,
it
is
much
lower .
I
am
not
taking
the
number .
That
means,
even
at
minus
5,
minus
10,
degree
centigrade,
water
is
still
liquid.
W e
have
already
given
one
example
of
ice
cream,
where
it
is
minus
2.5
o
C,
initial
freezing
point.
That
means,
till
minus
2.5
o
C,
no
water
is
getting
frozen,
right.
But,
I
hope,
you
know ,
Raoult's
law ,
where
it
is
said
that,
the
concentration
of
the
solutes
in
the
liquid
brings
down
or
lowers
down
the
freezing
point
or
increases
the
boiling
point,
or
called
elevation
of
boiling
point
or
in
other
word
it
is
said
elevation
of
boiling
point
or
depression
of
freezing
point,
right.
So,
but
how
much
ice
cream
minus
2.5
o
C,
more
or
less
this
is
one
of
the,
one
of
the
lowest
freezing
point
with
food
material.
All
other
will
have
minus
0.5
o
C,
minus
1
o
C,
things
like
that.
So,
that
means,
the
prime
thing
which
we
would
like
to
highlight
here
is
that
any
impairment
of
quality
during
freezing
is
not
because
of
temperature,
whatever
be
the
temperature,
minus
5,
minus
10,
minus
20
o
C.
It
is
not
the
temperature
who
is
responsible
for
any
change
in
quality .It
is
the
transformation
of
water
to
ice,
that
is,
formation
of
ice
is
the
prime
culprit
for
any
change
in
quality
during
freezing,
ok.
Therefore,
the
transformation
of
water
to
ice,
there
is
a
nucleation,
right.
There
is
a
term
called
nucleation
and
unless
a
nucleus
is
formed
there
will
not
be
any
formation
of
ice
crystal.
There
are
two
types
of
this
nucleation,
one
is
homogeneous
and
the
other
is
heterogeneous,
or
catalytic,
and
this
occurs
in
food
materials
that
homogeneous,
not
non
homogeneous,
or
heterogeneous,
occur
in
food
material,
which
involves
formation
of
nuclei,
adjacent
to
suspended
foreign
particles,
right,
like
surface
film,
foreign
particles
or
on
the
walls
of
the
containers,
with
that
necessitates,
some
super
cooling
temperature,
and
for
that
the
temperature
is
lowered
to
some
critical
value,
where
nucleation
begins,
and
further
decrease
in
temperature
results
in
abrupt
increase
in
nucleation
rate.
So,
if
you
just
follow
properly ,
then
you
see
that,
we
have
said
already ,
some
information,
which
are
very
critical
or
crucial,
that
is,
which
involve,
that
is,
formation
of
nucleus,
are
adjacent
to
suspended
foreign
material,
surface
film,
or
walls,
right.
So,
these
are
minimum
requirement
for
the
formation
of
water
to
ice,
as
well,
we
are
also
saying
necessitates
some
super
cooling,
that
is,
by
lowering
the
temperature
to
some
critical
value,
where
nucleation
begins,
and
if
we
decrease
the
temperature
further ,
it
results
in
abrupt
decrease
in
nucleation
rate,
or
rather
abrupt
increase
in
nucleation
rate,
right.
So,
here
you
have
come
to
know ,
one
very
important
thing,
that
it
is
not
the
temperature,
which,
if
you
lower
down
automatically ,
you
will
get
ice
to,
water
to
ice
transformation.
Now ,
so,
if
we
assume
that,
say ,
this
is
a
container ,
and
there
is
some
water ,
right,
and
if
we
lower
down
the
temperature,
from
both
the
sides,
if
it
is
one
dimensional
heat
transfer .
So,
if
you
apply ,
or
subtract
Q
quantity
of
heat
from
here,
then
the
temperature
of
this
will
go
on
decreasing,
say
T1,
then
T2,
then
T3
etc.
right.
And
if
this
water
is
pure
like
H
2
O
only ,
there
is
no
other
thing,
like
there
is
no
suspended
foreign
material,
there
is
no
surface
films,
and
the
wall,
I
am
talking
about
wall
now ,
right.
So
it
is
pure
water
H
2
O
only ,
other
things
are
not
available.
Then,
if
you
lower
down
the
temperature,
still
further ,
there
will
not
be
any
formation
of
nucleus,
because,
as
we
have
seen,
for
formation
of
nucleus,
either
one
or
more
than
one
of
these
are
required,
that
is,
suspended
foreign
material,
or
some
surface
films,
or
some
walls
of
the
containers,
right,
where,
the
nucleation
will
begin.
But
if
we
have
already
removed
these
things,
then
we
have
only
pure
water ,
H
2
O,
right,
pure
water ,
H
2
O
is
there.
So,
if
we
still
decrease
the
temperature,
and
while
doing
that,
I
hope,
you
have
seen
thermo
flux,
right,
thermo
flux.
This
you
have
seen,
perhaps
at
home,
or
outside,
and
you
have
seen
that,
it
is
a
container
in
which,
there
is
another
container
like
one
in
a
one,
like
if
this
is
the
container ,
obviously ,
of
this
size,
that
is
in
another
container ,
like
this,
one,
right,
and
the
wall
of
this
is
so
polished,
that
you
can
see
your
face,
it
acts
like
a
mirror ,
and
that
is
also
having
a
cap,
and
if
you
open
the
cap
and
see
inside,
then
also
you
see,
like
the
outside
inside
isalso
so
much,
like
outside
it
is
polished,
right.
So
depending
on
the
polishing
the
one
which
we
said
that
wall,
this
we
said
wall
normally
again
in
this
case
let
me
tell
though
this
is
not
part
of
it,
but
still
if
you
have
read
fluid
flow ,
then
there
was
one
chart,
that
is
called
Moody's
chart,
M
O
O
D
I,
Moody's
chart,
right.
How
the
chart
is
look
like?
The
chart
looks
like,
this,
that
you
have
log
log
graph,
this
is
f,
this
is
N
R e
and
the
curves
are
like
this,
for
dif ferent
epsilon
by
D,
where
this
is
called
relative
roughness,
relative
roughness,
right.
So,
if
it
is
relative
roughness,
epsilon
by
D,
for
a
given
epsilon
by
D,
you
can
find
out
beforehand,
you
have
found
out,
N
R e
and
then,
you
can
find
out
the
friction
factor .
Why
it
has
come?
Because,
normally
we
think,
what,
if
this
is
a
pipe
and
if
this
is
the
L
of
the
pipe,
right,
but
Moody's
said
that
if
we
think,
like
this,
that,
this
is
the
L,
through
which
a
fluid
has
to
move,
it
is
not
so.
What
he
said,
if
you
take
the
inside
of
the
pipe,
take
a
section,
and
see
under
microscope,
right,
then
you
will
see
the
pipe,
which
was
supposed
to
be
like
this,
but
is
not,
it
is
like
this.
So,
instead
of
the
liquid
or
fluid
moving
from
this
end
to
that
end,
as
L,
it
is
moving
from
here
to
there,
like
this,
like
this,
like
this,
like
this,
much
more
than
L.
So,
what
we
are
talking
about,
L
is
not
the
L,
because
the
fluid
has
to
move
much
more
than
L,
as
the
wall
is
rough.
So,
depending
on
the
roughness
we
said
epsilon
by
D,
that
is,
the
relative
roughness
that
came
up.
W e
are
not
going
into
more
in
detail
of
this,
but
if
you
look
at
that
if
we
can
do
our
this
container
that
roughness
is
absolutely
0,
it
is
policed
in
such
a
way
that
the
roughness
is
absolutely
0.
Then
we
said
that,
walls,
that
is
one
of
the
criteria
to
form
the
nucleus.
If
we
have
already
removed
suspended
foreign
material,
we
have
removed
surface
films
nothing
is
there.
So,
we
have
also
made
the
inside
so
nicely
polished
that
there
is
no
roughness,
it
is
really
L
is
equals
to
L
because
this
turbulence
or
rather
this
roughness
we
have
removed
and
it
has
become
1
L
that
can
be
done
by
polishing
right.
And
under
this
situation
if
it
is
so
good
material
where
there
is
no
roughness
then
the
liquid
will
remain
as
liquid.
If
we
even
go
down
to
minus
5,
or
minus
10,
or
some
that
is
what
I
said
that
scientist
have
brought
the
temperature
much
lower ,
by
taking
care
of
all
these
right.
So,
for
the
formation
of
the
nucleus
you
need
a
site
right
that
site
which
we
call
that
you
need
a
site,
that
site
could
be
suspended
foreign
materials,
suspended
film
or
any
other
or
wall,
right.
Now ,
then,
we
also
said,
there
are
two
ways
of
forming
the,
sorry ,
there
are
two
ways
of
forming,
or
two
types
of
nucleation,
as
one
is
heterogeneous,
and
other
is
homogeneous,
right.
Then
if
we
look
at
the
formation
of
the
nucleus,
then
you
see
that,
it
is
a
function
of
either
of
the
three
singly ,
or
in
combination,
that
is,
the
temperature,
here
you
see,
it
isminus
50,
and
if
that
means,
it
is
not
to
a
scale,
it
is
an
indicative,
this
is,
if
this
is
0,
and
if
we
go
right,
normally ,
we
go
with
temperature,
as
you
proceed,
the
temperature
goes
up,
but
it,
since,
it
is
lowering.
So,
we
are
saying
that,
as
we
are
proceeding,
temperature
is
going
down,
and
say ,
this
is
minus
50
o
C,
and
this
is
the
rate
of
nucleation,
for
that
you
see,
it
is
0,0.
So,
this
is
the
origin,
and
the
line
which
we
have
drawn,
for
the
formation
of
nucleus,
or
rate
of
nucleus
formation
is
not
passing
through
this
0,0
or
origin.
It
is
some
less
than
0
temperature,
which
we
have
said
sub
cool,
where,
the
formation
of
nucleus
begins.
Now ,
once
the
nucleus
is
formed,
then
it
is
the
rate
of
nucleation
is
proceeding
more
or
less,
as
of
course,
we
have
to
we
have
to
keep
this
temperature
dif ference,
initial
super
cooling,
rate
of
heat
removal
either
singly
or
in
combination,
right.
So,
that
we
have
to
keep
and
then
the
nucleus
formation
is
exponentially
increasing.
I
hope,
this
curve
is
exponential,
that
you
know ,
exponential,
right,
that
you
know .
This
type
of
curve
is
called
exponential,
right.
So,
once
we
have
this,
then
the
rate,
either
again,
we
say
that
either
the
temperature
dif ference
delta
T ,
between
the
material
and
the
cooling
medium,
that
has
to
be
high,
or
it
has
to
have
an
initial
super
cooling,
or
the
rate
of
heat
removal,
either
singly
or
in
combination
of
them,
anything
may
do.
This
job
that
instead
of
passing
it
through
the
origin
it
will
have
a
lowering
of
temperature,
and
at
that
temperature,
where
the
nucleation
will
start,
but
that
is
not
0,0,
that
is
somewhere
lower
than
0,
at
any
temperature,
since,
it
is
a
schematic
one,
not
calibrated
one.
So,
we
cannot
say
that,
what
is
the
temperature?
Obviously ,
dif ferent
for
dif ferent
materials,
right.
Now ,
with
this,
once
you
have
the
formation
of
nucleus,
then
it
comes,
how
the
nucleus?
That
means,
you
have
one
nucleus,
say
here,
and
if
we
assume
this
to
be
a
food
material,
and
you
know
that,
in
all
food
materials,
there
are
cells,
there
are
tissues,
there
are
dissolved
solids,
or
D
S
dissolved
solids,
etc.
right.
So,
if
we
assume
that,
say
one
nucleus
has
formed,
this
is
an
enlar ged
one,
right,
that
nucleus,
size
of
the
nucleus
can
be
as
small
as
you
can
think
of,
right
number
1.
Then
what
will
happen?
So,
this
is
a
another
water
molecule,
this
is
another
water
molecule,
this
may
be
another
water
molecule.
Now ,
under
given
condition
of
this
temperature
dif ference,
initial
super
cooling,
or
rate
of
heat
removal,
under
this
condition,
this
is
all
produced
by
obviously ,
lowering
of
temperature,
right,
by
lowering
of
temperature,
this
is
happening.
So,
under
that
condition,
which
is
prevailing
already ,
one
nucleus
has
formed,
surrounding
water
molecules,
they
will
then
have
the
option,
either
form
another
nucleus
under
this
same
situation,
or
if
they
are
not
capable,
then
they
will
go
and
join
this
already
formed
nucleus.
So,
the
size
of
the
nucleus
now
will
be
little
more,
and
then
if
this
one
also
joins
there,
then
that
will
be
even
more,
then
if
this
one
also
joins
there,
then
that
will
be
even
more
right.
So,
instead
of
forming
another
nucleus,
if
these
water
molecules
surrounding,
they
think
or
they
have
not
that
ener gy
to
form
a
nucleus,
they
will
join
to
the
already
formed
nucleus,
and
the
size
of
the
nucleus
will
go
up,
or
this
is
called
crystal,
size
of
thecrystal
will
go
up,
right.
Then,
this
is
of
course,
in
black,
should
have
been
in
white.
The
same
for
the
growth
of
the
crystal,
that
means,
that
from
nucleus
N,
it
has
now
formed
a
crystal,
or
ice
crystal,
we
say
ice,
see
ice
crystal.
There
also,
you
see
that,
the
temperature
dif ference,
initial
super
cooling,
and
rate
of
heat
removal,
all
these
are
factors
to
have
the
growth
of
the
nucleus,
right,
and
growth
of
the
nucleus
rate,
it
is
passing
through
origin
0,0,
unlike
that
formation
of
nucleus,
it
was
N,
from
there
it
was
like
this,
right.
So,
it
is
passing
through
the
origin
and
the
nature
of
the
curve
is
curvilinear ,
means
as
these
factors
are
imposing,
the
size
of
the
crystal
is
also,
or
growth
of
the
crystal
size
is
also
increasing,
but
not
exponentially .
It
is
a
curvilinear ,
right.
So,
with
this
our
time
is
over
today .
So,
let
us
stop
and
we
have
understood
why
nucleation
is
important,
right,
and
how
it
is
af fecting,
it
will
af fect
the
quality ,
we
will
come
to
that
afterwards.
Thank
you
very
much.
