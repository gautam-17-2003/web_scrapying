Solving
with
Carnot
System
Good
morning
my
dear
students
and
friends.
Do
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
class,
we
have
finished
the
Carnot
Refrigeration
System,
its
dif ficulties
and
one
of
its
remedies,
right.
So,
today
let
us
do,
a
problem
and
its
solution,
right.
Let
us
do
a
problem,
and
its
solution,
right
and
the
problem
is
like
this.
Let
me
take
it
to
the
other
side
here,
I
could
rightly ,
here,
we
are
saying
that,
the
compression
ratio
is
5,
right,
so
that
means,
the
dif ference
between
the
two
pressures,
is
5.
So,
one
is
5
times
more
than
the
other .
So,
which,
one
it
can
be?
W e
have
already
studied
a
lot,
who
is,
what
is
compressor
doing?
Compressor
is
receiving,
some
earlier ,
it
was
liquid
now ,
it
is
no
longer
liquid,
it
is
vapour .
So,
from
vapour ,
a
pressure
of
evaporator
pressure,
of
P
e
to
a
condenser
pressure
of
P
c.
It
is
compressing,
right.
So,
that
is
what
we
can
say ,
the
compression
ratio
is
5
right.
So,
what
we
are
seeing,
here
is
that,
let
me
take
it
to
this
side
a
little,
that
becomes
easy
for
you
yeah.
So,
if
we
have
taken
to
this
side
a
little,
then
the
problem
is
like
this,
in
a
reversed
refrigeration
Carnot
refrigeration
system,
of
one
ton
of
refrigeration
cooling
capacity ,
running
on
perfect
gas.
Heat
is
absorbed
at
minus
10
degree
centigrade
and
rejected
at
plus
50
degree
centigrade.
Find
the
states
at
all
the
points
of
the
cycle,
heat
transfer
and
work
done
in
all
the
processes,
mass
flow
rate,
volume
flow
rates
and
the
COP .
So,
so
many
things,
we
have
been
asked
to
do.
The
maximum
pressure,
at
inlet
to
the
isentropic
compression
or
compressor
is
standard
atmospheric
pressure.
W e
have
been
given,
some
values
like
C
p
is
1.005
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin,
universal
gas
constant
R
as
0.287
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin
and
the
heat
capacity
ratios
that
is
gamma
to
be
1.4.
Basically ,
you
know
that,
for
diatomic
gases,
the
heat
capacity
ratio,
is
1.4.
However ,
to
understand
the
problem,
let
us
repeat
the
problem.
It
is
saying
that,
the
compression
ratio
is
5,
which
we
have
just
discussed.
In
a
reverse
Carnot
refrigeration
system
of
1
ton
of
refrigeration
cooling
capacity
running
on
perfect
gas
heat
is
absorbed
at
minus
10
degree
centigrade
and
rejected
at
50
degree
centigrade.Find
the
states
at
all
the
points
of
the
cycle,
and
also
heat
transfer
and
work
done
in
all
the
processes,
mass
flow
rate,
volume
flow
rates
and
the
COP .
The
maximum
pressure
at
inlet
to
the
isentropic
compression
is
standard
atmospheric
pressure.
Standard
atmospheric
pressure
means,
one
atmospheric
pressure,
that
we
can
also
convert
it
into
bar ,
you
know
there
are
many
ways
of
expressing
the
pressure.
So,
one
other
unit,
could
be
bar
one
is
atmosphere,
one
could
be
millimeter
of
mercury ,
things
like
that.
So,
we
are
also
given
with
some
values
like
Cp
is
1.005
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin
and
universal
gas
constant
R
as
0.287
kilo
joules
per
kg
kelvin.
The
heat
capacity
ratios
that
is
gamma
is
1.4.
So,
hopefully ,
you
will
solve
it
your
before
looking
into
the
solution,
which,
we
are
providing,
or
which,
I
am
providing.
I
hope,
you
will
do
this
first,
and
then,
look
into
the
solution,
right.
So,
first
thing,
which
we
do
is
that,
what
are
the
things
given?
Our
things
given
is
p1
is
1.01325
bar ,
1.01325
bar ,
that
is
the
standard
atmospheric
pressure.
Y ou
are
also
given,
T1
as
minus
10
degree
centigrade,
that
is
263
kelvin,
right
263
kelvin.
Kelvin
has
come
out
here
so,
263
kelvin
and
T2,
we
are
also
given
as
50
degree
centigrade,
which,
we
can
convert
into
kelvin
as
this
is
by
mistake,
cut
and
paste,
this
is
263.
So,
it
was
again
263
right.
So
273
plus
minus
10
is
263,
but
273
plus
50
is
equal
to
323.
So
323,
perhaps,
afterwards,
I
have
corrected
it
exactly
right.
So,
it
is
not
263
it
is
323
kelvin
right.
W e
are
given
that,
the
pressure
ratio
is
p2
is
to
p1
is
equal
to
5.
Now ,
I
tell
you
that,
what
we
have
done
in
T -s
diagram.
If
you
remember
that,
we
have
this
dome,
like
this,
right.
W e
started
with
here,
as
point
1,
went
to
this
place
at
point
2,
or
we
have
been
asked,
we
have
been
said,
rather ,
if
you
remember ,
if
you
look
at,
if
you
look
at
this,
that
in
a
reversed
Carnot
refrigeration
system,
right.
Already ,
we
have
been
given,
a
reversed
Carnot
refrigeration
system,
no
modifications
have
been
said,
right.
So,
that
means,
instead
of,
instead
of
that,
we
can
say ,
we
can
say
that,
we
have,
sorry ,
we
have
this
T -s
diagram,
and
we
have
the
dome
like
this,,
and
we
started
with
here,
there,
there,
there,
this
was
point
1,
this
is
point
2,
this
is
point
3
and
this
is
point
4,
right.
And
we
have
been
asked
that,
p2
is
to
p1
is
5
right,
p2
is
to
p1
is
5.
This
is
the
p,
this
is
the
p
diagram,
and
this
is
the,
this
is
the
p
diagram,
by
p1,
and
this
is
the
p2
diagram,
right.
So,
p2
to
p1
is
5,
that
is
given,
and
this
is
by
mistake,
I
have
made
to
63,
but
it
is
3
2
3
Kelvin,
that
we
have
just
shown,
we
have
been
given
p2
is
to
p1
is
5.
So,
we
can
write
p2
is
to
p1
is
equal
to
T2
is
to
T1,
to
the
power
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1,
that
pV
gamma
is
constant,
from
there
right.
So,
p1
V1
to
the
power
gamma
by
T1
is
equal
to
p2
V2
to
the
power
gamma
by
T2.
So,
from
there,
we
can
write
that,
p2
is
to
p1
is
equal
to
T2
is
to
T1
to
the
power
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1,
right.So,
this
we
have
to,
every
time
whenever ,
we
are
clearing
3
2
3
Kelvin.
So,
it
is
T2
is
also
known
T1
is
known.
So,
323
over
263,
here
we
have
corrected,
that
is,
to
the
power
gamma
that
is
1.4
by
1.4
minus
1.
So,
it
is
2.05288
is
the
p2
is
to
p1
ratio,
right
and
it
is
said
that
p2
is
to
p1
is
5.
So,
p2
can
be
written
as
2.05288
into
1.01325.
So,
it
is
2.08
bar
right.
Now ,
we
also
know
that
p3
is
to
p2
is
nothing,
but
p3
is
to
p1,
over
p2
is
to
p1,
right.
So,
this
is
p0
p3
p2
is
to
p1
over ,
no
p3
is
to
p1
over
p3
is
to
p1,
over
p2
is
to
p1
right.
And
you
know
p3
and
p2
are
same,
this
was,
this
was
0.1.
This
was
for
0.2,
and
after
isothermal,
this
is
also
0.3.
So,
the
pressure
remains
same,
however ,
that
is
dif ferent,
we
are
not
looking
into
that,
now .
So,
we
can
write
it
is,
5
is
to,
sorry ,
5
is
to
2
5
is
to
2.03
2.05
over ,
my
goodness,
5
is
to
2.05288.
So,
this
is
2.4356,
and
this
is
also
same
as
p4
is
to
p1
right.
Therefore,
p3
is
5
times
1.01325,
that
is
5.06625
bar ,
and
p4,
can
be
written
as
2.4356
into
1.01325,
that
is
2.4678717
bar
right.
So,
we
can
say
that
q1
to
2,
that
is,
this
point
q1
to
2
is
0
right.
So,
we
can
now
say ,
that,
minus
W1
to
2
is
H2
minus
H1,
which,
we
have
shown
earlier ,
utilizing
it
now ,
is
Cp
into
T2
minus
T1,
and
this
is
equal
to
1.005
into
60
that
is
60.3
kilo
Joules
per
kg.
Then
q2
to
3
is
W
2to
3.
It
is
minus
R T2
ln
p3
over
p2,
and
this
is
equal
to
minus
0.287
into
323
into
ln
of
2.4356,
this
comes
equal
to
82.52179
kilo
Joules
per
kg
right.
So,
we
can
write
now ,
that
W3
to
4
is
H3
minus
H4.
So,
that
is
equal
to
Cp
times
T3
minus
T4
and
that
is,
60.3
kilo
Joules
per
kg
and
therefore,
again
q3
to
4
is
also
0.
So,
1
to
2
was
this
and
3
to
4
was
this,
right.
So,
this
was
1,
this
was
2,
this
was
3,
and
this
was
4.
So,
q3
to
4
is
also
0,
then,
we
can
write
COP
is,
as
it
is
defined,
COP
is
T1
over
T2
minus
T1.
So,
that
is
263
by
323
minus
263
and
that
comes
to
be
4.383.
It
is
a
very
high
COP
4.383.
For
a
system
of
1
ton
of
refrigeration
capacity ,
we
can
write,
this
is
m
dot
q4
to
1
is
1
ton
of
refrigeration,
because,
this
is
giving
this
one,
4
to
1
right.
So,
that
4
to
1
is
that
refrigeration
ef fect,
and
that
is
1
ton
right.
So,
and
this
is
3.5167
kilo
W att
right.
So,
if
that
be
true,
then
we
can
say
that
the
mass
flow
rate
m
dot
is
3.5167
over
67.19266.
So,
this
is
0.05233
kilo
Joules
per
second
right.
Therefore,
the
volume
flow
rate,
at
state
point
1,
we
can
write
is
m
dot
R T1
by
P1
and
this
on
substitution
of
the
values,
we
can
say ,
it
is
0.03898
meter
cube
per
second.
Then,
we
can
also
say
that,
volume
flow
rate
at
state
point
4.
So,
at
state
point
1
that
is,
here
at
state
point
1,
the
volume
flow
rate
was
0.03898
and
at
state
point
4,
that
is,
this,
the
volume
flow
rate
is
m
dot
R T4
over
P4.
So,
this
on
substitution
of
the
values
is
2
4
6.78717
is
P4.
So,
is
0.01689
meter
cube
per
second.
So,
we
can
write
that,
specific
volumes
at
various
points,
and
they
are
like
this
V1
is
R T1
by
P1
and
that
is
equal
to
0.287
into
263
by
101.325.So,
it
is
0.7449
meter
cube
per
kg
right.
Similarly ,
V2
is
R T2
by
P2
and
is
0.287
into
323
over
208
that
is
0.445
meter
cube
per
kg
right.
Now ,
the
third
one
is
volume
V3.
So,
V3
is
R T3
by
P3.
So,
it
was
0.287
into
323
over
506.625
that
is,
0.18297meter
cube
per
kg.
And
V4
is
R T4
by
P4
that
is
0.287
into
263
over
246.78717.
This
is
equal
to
0.30585meter
cube
per
kg.
So,
specific
volumes
are
also
found
out.
W e
have
also
found
out
COP .
If
you
remember ,
what
are
the
things,
you
are
asked
to
find
out,
if
you
remember ,
what
are
the
things
you
are
asked
to
find
out,
is
like
thi,s
that
we
are
asked
to
find
out,
what
are
the
that,
find
the
state
points,
at
all
the
points,
of
all
the
cycle,
and
heat
transfer
rate
and
work
done
in
all
the
processes.
Now ,
work
done
we
have
said,
heat
transfer
will
be
doing,
and
state
points
finding
out,
will
be
doing,
but
mass
flow
rate,
we
have
done,
volume
flow
rates,
we
have
done,
COP
we
have
done,
maximum
pressure
at
inlet
to
the
isentropic
compression,
it
is
already
given.
So,
many
of
them
we
have
already
done
right.
Now ,
we
have
to
find
out
the
state
points
and
we
have
to
find
out
the
state
points,
and
this
is
the
reverse
Carnot
cycle,
which
we
are
referring
to
right,
which
we
are
referring
to
is
this,
that,
Q
4
to
1,
we
have
said
it
to
be
0,
W
4
to
1,
Q
1
to
2
is
equal
to
also
0,
we
have
said,
we
have
found
out,
Q
3
to
4
is
0
right.
So,
W
1
to
2,
W
2
to
3
and
W
3
to
4,
these
things
we
have
found
out,
and
W
4
to
1
right.
So,
this
is
the
reverse
Carnot
cycle
which
we
have
done
with
two
compressors.
Now
the
thing
which
we
need
is
to
find
out
the
state
points
right.
If
we
plot
in
a
T -S
diagram
then
you
see
that,
dome
is
here
this
is
the
triple
point,
we
have
from
point
1,
it
is
P
1,
point
2
it
is
P
2,
point
3
it
is
P
3
and
point
4
it
is
P
4,
right
and
we
have
been
also
given
T
1
is
263
and
T
2
is
323
right.
So,
all
the
pressures
and
temperatures,
we
know .
So,
two
properties,
we
know
P
1
and
T
1
and
the
other
one
P
2,
T
2,
P
3,
T
2
and
P
4,
T
1,
we
know .
So,
we
can
draw
the
T -S
diagram
right.
So,
we
have
done
the
T -S
diagram,
like
this,
and
if
we
want
to
do
it
to
be
P-V
diagram,
P-V
diagram,
then
unfortunately ,
perhaps,
I
could
not
do
it
properly ,
because
this
was
manually
done
by
me
right.
So,
obviously ,
V
1,
V
2,
V
3
and
V
4
are
done,
you
please
check
whether ,
V
3
and
V
4
are
in
the
right
place,
or
all
are
in
the
right
place,
right,
then,
all
Ps
are,
they
are
known.
So,
if
you
plot
a
P-V
diagram,
you
take
a
P-V
diagram,
right,
you
know
the
values
of
P
1,
V
1,
you
know
the
values
of
P
2,
V
2,
you
know
the
values
of
P
3,
V
3,
and
you
know
the
values
of
P
4,
V
4,
right.
So,
all
the
values
you
know .
So,
take
a
graph
paper
and
solve
it
and
draw
it
properly ,
maybe
here,
I
could
not
have
drawn
because,
this
was
drawn
by
me,
and
obviously ,
maybe
not
that
much
conversant
with
this
kind
of
drawing
in
this
kind
of
board.
So,
I
have
a
doubt,
whether
this
diagram
is
correct
or
not,
please,
you
draw
P-V
diagram,
andsee
how
the
processes
are
getting
changed,
right,
and
show
all
the
state
points
1,
2,
3,
4
and
you
know
P-Vs.
So,
you
can
identify ,
all
4
points.
So,
this
way
you
can
obviously ,
find
out
the
P-V
diagram
ok.
So,
perhaps,
with
this
we
complete
the
ideal
situations
that
is
Carnot's.
Now ,
afterwards,
we
will
go
to
the
actual,
which
is
in
the
market,
or
in
your
commercial
level,
things
are
being
done,
ok.
So,
thank
you
all.
