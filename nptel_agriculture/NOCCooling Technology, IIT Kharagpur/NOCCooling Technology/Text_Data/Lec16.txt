Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
Good
afternoon
my
dear
students.
Basically,
you
have
come
across
the
basic
thermodynamics,
because
we
are
in
the
last
part
of
the
basics
of
thermodynamics,
and
it
is
a
continued
one
since
4,
5
classes,
because
as
you
see
that
lot
many
things,
we
have
learnt
from
here.
Certain
more
things
are
also
there
which
we
need
to
learn.
So,
if
you
remember
that
in
the
previous
class
we
have
shown
you
p
h
diagram
right
and
lot
of
things
we
have
introduced
like
entropy,
definition
of
entropy,
relations
of
entropy
with
many
other,
internal
energy,
enthalpy.
So,
all
these,
we
have
already
talked
about,
but
still
there
are
certain
relations
which
we
need
to
know
like
work,
also
we
have
shown
that
it
is
p
d
v,
integral
p
d
v
right.
So,
these
things
we
need
to
nurture
regularly
so
that
we
come
across
the
actual
relations
as and when required, right.
So,
we
now
go
back
to
that
p
h
diagram
as
you
see
from
here
that
p
h
diagram,
it
tells
many
things
right,
but
one
thing
you
see
that
the
constant
entropy
lines,
these
are
the
constant
entropy
lines,
right,
but
these
constant
entropy
lines
are
not
straight,
right
it
is
not
straight.
So,
that
is
the
thing
that
entropy
is
changing,
that
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
whereas,
you
see
saturated
liquid
line,
saturated
vapour
line,
pressures,
they
are
more
or
less,
it
can
be
said
that
they
are
straight,
but
entropy
is
not
there.
So,
this
tells
the
critical
point,
triple
point
everything
from
p
h
diagram
we
will
show
afterwards
T-S
diagram,
whenever
it
is
coming
right,
but
you
see
thecharacteristics
of
this
p
h
diagram
is
that
the
dome
is
a
little
inclined
right.
I
have
to
incline
this
way,
dome
is
little
inclined
and
this
inclination
as
it
is
evident,
this
is
the
dome
right.
I
hope
you
can
see
the
cursor,
as
it
is
moving.
So,
this
is
called
the
dome
and
that
is
vapour
liquid
saturation
line
right.
So,
this
saturation
line
is
the
vapour
liquid
saturation
line
and
in
p
h
diagram
this
is
a
little
inclined
may
not
be
so
in
T-S
diagram,
right
we
will
come
in
T-S
diagram,
do
not
worry
about
it.
So,
pressure
versus
enthalpy,
that
is
h
there
is
kilojoules
per
kg
and
pressure
is
in
Pascal
or
kilo
Pascal.
So,
this
gives,
someday,
I
will
also
show,
there
are,
nowadays,
softwares
available
from
where
you
can
make
this
saturation
line
and
many other properties available.
These
are
nowadays
available
because
as
you
know
with
time,
progress
of
time,
lot
of
research
are
going
on
including
the
development
of
the
basic
thing
like
that
P-h
diagram,
T-S
diagram,
P-V
diagram,
all
these
are
nowadays
available
in
software
right.
So,
software
companies
have
developed
them,
will
use
them.
Now,
this
one
is
a
typical
p
h
diagram,
and
the
pressure
P
1
and
pressure
P
2
are
there
which
are
as
it
is
here,
P
1,
it
is
P
1
and
this
is
P
2.
I
can
use
this,
that
is
not
here,
next
time
we
will
do
that.
So,
pressure,
this
is
P
1,
this
is
P
2,
right
are
there
where
P
1
is
obviously,
as
it
is
seen
P
1
is
greater
than P 2.
The
constant
pressure
line
that
is
1,
2,
3,
4;
where
is
1,
this
is
1,
this
is
2,
this
is
3,
and
this
is
4
so,
this
line
is
constant
pressure
line.
So,
for
pressure
P
1
it
is
constant
pressure
line
portions
of
1
to
2
is
the
sub
cooled
region,
this
is
the
saturated
line
right.
So,
anything
beyond
that
this
side
will
be
sub
cooled
right.
Similarly
between
2
to
3
this
one
is
the
wet
region
because
here
this
is
a
mixture
of
vapour
liquid
right,
this
is
a
mixture
of
vapour
liquid.
So,
2
to
3
is
the
wet
region,meaning there is a mixture of liquid and vapour.
So,
between
3
to
4
it
is
again,
this
side,
it
was
sub
cooled,
this
side,
it
is
super
heated
right
this
side,
it
is
sub
cooled
this
side
it
is
super
heated
region
right.
So,
1
to
2
is
sub
cooled
region,
2
to
3
is
saturated
region,
3
to
4
is
super
heated
region,
right.
So,
it
is
a
frequent
problem
in
refrigeration
cycle,
calculation
to
find
the
properties
of
sub
cooled
liquid,
at
point
A,
as
we
can
see
from
the
previous
figure
that
there
is
a
sub
cooled
point,
a,
right.
It
is
very
difficult
to
find
out
the
property
values
at
this
point,
right.
So,
the
liquid
is
at
a
pressure of p 1, and the temperature is T a and it is sub cooled.
So,
the
liquid
at
point
a
prime,
where
is
that
point
a
prime?
You
see,
this
is
a
and
if
we
come
perpendicular
to
this,
it
comes
to
the
saturated
line,
and
this
is
a
new
point
'a'.
Obviously,
this
pressure,
which
was
p
1,
there
the
pressure
is
not
p
1,
right
because
it
is
p
h
diagram.
So,
p
is
constant
all
along
1,
2,
3,
4,
but
this
when
we
are
going
from
'a'
to
'a'
prime
the
pressure
is
not
constant
ok.
The
liquid
at
the
point
a
prime
is
saturated
liquid
at
lower
pressure
that
is
p
a,
but
at
the
same
time
at
the
same
temperature
T
a
also
right.
Again,
go
back
at
the
same
temperature
T
a
temperature
did
not
change
pressure
has
come
down.
it
has
come
to
p
a
right
or
p
a
prime
whereas,
temperature
remained
as
T
a
right
that
could
have
been
seen
from
T
S
diagram
or
if
we
have
the
bigger
p
h
diagram
including
the
temperatures
then
we
could
show
that
this
is
so
right.
So,
if
we
say
that
then
we
can
write
for
this
T
d
S
is
equal
to
d
U
plus
p
d
v.
If
the
liquid
can
be
assumed
to
be
incompressible
then
obviously,
d
v
is
0
right,
because
incompressible,
we
have
said
earlier
also,
that
the
density
becomes
0.
So,
d
v
is
also
0
therefore,
T
d
S
can
be
written
as
d
U.
So,
it
is
valid
to
assume
that
for
liquids
the
internal
energy
may
be
function
of
temperature alone.T ds = du + p dv; dv = 0. âˆ´ T ds = du.
So,
we
can
write
U
a
is
equal
to
U
a
prime,
therefore,
we
also
can
write
S
a
is
equal
to
S
a
prime.
Since
the
temperatures
T
a
are
same
as
T
a
prime
or
rather
is
same
as
T
a
prime.
Hence,
the
states
a
and
a
prime
are
coincident,
right
they
are
coinciding.
We
can
also
see,
from
the
relation
T
d
S
is
equal
to
d
h
minus
v
d
p
and
there
the
specific
volume
is
small
for
liquid,
and
hence,
v
d
p
can
be
neglected,
because
v
is
very
small,
specific
volume
for
liquids
are
very
small,
density
of
liquids
are
high,
density
of
gases
are
low,
but
its
specific
volume
is
high,
right
this
information
keep
in
mind.
The
specific
volume
is
small
for
liquids, hence, v d p can be neglected.
So,
we
can
write
that
h
a
is
also
equal
to
h
a
prime
right
because
that
v
d
p
is
out.
So,
T
d
S
is
d
h
right.
So,
we
can
write
that
h
a
is
equal
to
h
a
prime.
This
means
that
the
enthalpy
of
the
sub
cooled
liquid
is
equal
to
the
enthalpy
of
the
saturated
liquid,
at
liquid
temperature
right.
Then
we
also
can
say
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
constant
pressure
line
are
assumed
to
be
coincident
with
the
saturated
liquid
line
in
the
sub cooled liquid region.
So,
in
the
sub
cooled
region,
we
can
also
say
that
the
pressures
are
also
becoming
coincident.
This
concept
is
very
useful
and
as
we
have
seen
from
the
other
figure
that
is
figure
A
let
us
go
into
that.
So,
as
we
can
see
that
this
p
h
diagram,
the
constant
pressure
lines,
where
they
are
the
constant
pressure
lines,
entropy,
vapour,
saturated
liquid,
vapour
saturated,
line
solid
vapour
and
constant
temperature
lines,
and
this
is
saturated
liquid
lines
and
these
are
the
constant
pressure
lines
right.
So,
from
there,
we
can
say
that
the
saturated
liquid
line
in
the
sub
cooled
region
is
also
pressure
becomes
coincident
right.
So,
we
can
write
that
T
s
diagram
and
this
if
we
show
in
T
s
diagram,
and
that
gives
a
lot
of
information
about
the
refrigeration
cycle.It
is
observed
from
the
relation
given
below
that
for
a
reversible
process
the
heat
transfer
is
governed
by
the
change
in
energy
that
is
dQ
reversible
equal
to
Tds
or
we
can
write
between
3
to
4.
Now,
between
3
to
4
means
we
go
back
to
where
again
here
that
3
to
4
this
portion
that
is
superheated
right.
So,
between
3
to
4
we
can
integrate
it
with
the
boundary
being
3
to
4
and
the
integral
part
is
dQ
reversible
and
this
is
equal
to
Q
3
to
4
right.
Therefore,
we
can
write
this
is
also
equal
to
T
ds
integral
between
3
to
4
right.
The
integral
on
the
right
hand
side
represents
the
area
under
the
line
3
to
4
on
a
T
s
coordinate by definition of integral right.
Therefore,
according
to
this
equation
the
heat
transfer
for
a
process
is
equal
to
the
area
under
the
line
on
T
s
diagram.
We
also
know
that
dTs
or
rather
T
ds
is
equal
to
dh
minus
vdp.
So,
for
a
constant
pressure
process
T
ds
is
also
equal
to
dh.
For
an
isobaric
process
now
isobaric
means
constant
pressure
right.
For
an
isobaric
process
the
area
under
the
curve is equal to change in enthalpy on T s diagram.
Along
the
constant
pressure
line
that
is
3
to
4
isentropic
lines
are
vertical
lines
on
T
s
diagram
isentropic
that
means,
entropy
is
constant.
So,
if
we
draw
then
we
will
see
that
this
s
is
constant
and
it
is
coming
vertical
lines
right.
Hence,
line
with
5
to
6
let
us
look
into
that
5
to
6
whether
it
is
here
or
not
yeah
it
is
not
here
it
is
some
other
picture.
So,
there
we
see
that
this
is
an
isentropic
line
that
is
constant
entropy
and
along
this
lines
S
5
is
equal
to
S
6
right.
So,
there
integral
of
3
to
4
is
equal
to
h
6
minus
h
5
that
is
equal
to
specific
work
and
the
line
5
to
7
is
a
real
non
isentropic
compression
process
in
the
T
s
diagram.
So,
from
the
pressure
enthalpy
diagram
it
is
observed
that
the
constant
entropy
lines
are
not
parallel
to
each
other
which
I
said
that
they
are
a
little
away
right
they
are
not
straight
rather
they
are
diver gent
right
it
is
really
like
this
it
is
going
out
and
it
is
diver gent.
The
advantage
of
this
diver gence
is
of
great
importance
in
reheat
process
for
steam
turbines
and
the
results
in
saving
of
compressor
work
in
multi
stage
compression
processes.
The
pressure
scale
in
this
diagram
may
be
linear
or
logarithmic
if
it
is
logarithmic
then
the
dome
becomes
very
flat
to
the
critical
point
right.
So,
this
we
again
look
at
because
we
have
the
p
h
diagram
here.
So,
the
this
dome
that
means,
when
it
is
saying
that
this
critical
point
it
comes
down
right
and
the
dome
becomes
more
flat
unlike
this
is
having
a
shape
proper
shape,
but
there
it
will
be
going
down
that
critical
pressure
or
critical
temperature
critical
point
that
will
come
down
and
the
nature
of
the
curve
will
be like this.
So,
it
will
be
much
compressed
right.
So,
if
we
go
back
to
that
we
can
say
that
if
the
pressure
scale
is
logarithmic
then
the
dome
becomes
very
much
flat
or
it
becomes
flattened
right.
So,
the
critical
point
also
goes
down
a
lot
because
of
the
flattening
of
the
p
h
curve
right
when
if
it
is
plotted
in
logarithmic
scale
it
can
be
plotted
in
normal
or
logarithmic
that
is
linear
or
logarithmic,
but
linear
you
have
no
problem,
but
if
it
is
logarithmic
then
the
entire
dome
is
squeezed
and
the
critical
temperature
or
point
that
goes
down
this
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
right.
Now
I
would
like
to
share
some
of
the
relations
and
its
definition
which
are
very
very
useful
in
anywhere
any
heat
transfer ,
any
mass
transfer ,
any
moment
momentum
transfer
this
is
very
very
helpful
right.
For
example,
we
know
very
well,
Reynolds
number
that
is
d
v
rho
by
mu
and
how
it
is
expressed? It is said to be a ratio of internal forces to the viscous  forces right.
So,
ratio
of
internal
forces
to
the
viscous
forces
is
the
Reynolds
number
and
most
of
you
use
it
many
many
times
right.
Prandtl
number
another
one
which
is
used
in
heat
transfer
very
much
and
that
is
C
p
mu
by
k
right.
I
hope
we
know
that
d
e
is
diameter ,
v
is
velocity ,
rho
is
density ,
mu
is
viscosity
and
here
C
p
is
specific
heat
under
constant
pressure,
C
p
mu
we
have
already
said
k
is
thermal
conductivity
right.
So,
this
is
also
expressed
as
ratio
of
momentum
diffusivity
that
is
kinetic
viscosity
to
thermal
diffusivity
right.
The
third
one
is
Nusselt
number
that
is
N
u
and
it
is
expressed
as
h
d
by
k,
h
is
the
heat transfer coef ficient, d is the diameter , k is the conductivity of  the material.
So,
it
is
also
expressed
in
terms
of
ratio
of
convective
to
conductive
heat
transfer
across
or
normal
to
the
boundary
that
is
the
Nusselt
number .
It
is
also
used
very
much
in
heat
transfer .
Schmidt
number
Sc
it
is
nu
by
d,
nu
we
have
already
said
it
is
kinematic
viscosity
and
d
is
the
diameter ,
then
it
is
expressed
as
ratio
of
momentum
diffusivity
where
viscosity
is
present
and
mass
diffusivity
right.
No,
this
capital
D
is
not
diameter ,
this
capital
D
is
diffusivity ,
mass
diffusivity
right.
And
in
many
cases,
of
course,
you
may
give
the
particular
nomenclature
may
be
d,
mass
or
d
diffusivity
this
kind
of
nomenclatures are also used.
However ,
others
are
like
Grashof
number
is
g
beta
delta
T
L
cube
over
v
square
or
nu
square
rather .
This
is
ratio
of
the
buoyancy
to
viscous
forces
acting
on
a
fluid.
And
for
today
the
last
one
is
say
Sherwood
number ,
this
is
also
used
very
much
in
mass
transfer
that
Sherwood
number
is
rho
a
into
h
D
into
L
over
D.
Here
obviously ,
h
is
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
that
is
ratio
of
convective
to
diffusive
mass
transfer
right.
So,
h
for
diffusion, L  is the length of course,  rho, is the density and this D is the dif fusivity ok.
So, subsequently , in subsequent classes  we will give some more relations which are very
very helpful.  Thank you.
