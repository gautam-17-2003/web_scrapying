Centrifugal
Compressor
Good
afternoon,
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
my
dear
friends.
We
have
completed
in
the
previous
classes
compressors
particularly
your
reciprocating
type.
Today,
we
are
doing
with
centrifugal
compression,
right.
Right
from
the
word
centrifugal
compression,
we
can
say,
it
is
only
on
at
the
end.
So,
we
can
say
that,
what
it
is?
It
is
also
known
as
turbo
compressors,
and
it
belongs
to
the
rotodynamic
type
of
compressors.
In
the
compressor
class,
previously,
we
have
said,
one
type
was
rotodynamic,
right.
So,
that
becomes,
the
centrifugal
compressors.
So,
in
these
compressors,
the
required
pressure
rise
takes
place
due
to
the
continuous
conversion
of
angular
momentum
imparted
to
the
refrigerant
vapour,
or
refrigerated
vapour,
by
a
high
speed
impeller,
into
static
pressure.
Unlike
reciprocating
compressors,
centrifugal
compressors
are
having
steady
flow
devices.
Hence,
they
are
subjected
to
less
vibration,
as
well
as,
less
noise,
right.
So,
if
we
show
one
such
compressor ,
which
is
under
centrifugal
force,
this
is
the
two
schematic
views,
right.
There
is
not
schematic,
it
is
schematic,
and
there
are,
as
you
see,
from
the
refrigerant
inlet,
right,
to
the
refrigerant
outlet,
it
is
divided
into
6
parts.
Number
1,
is
refrigerant
inlet,
and
it
is
done
through
the
eye
of
the
centrifugal
compressor .
Then
2,
is
the
impeller.
This
is
the
impeller,
which,
and
the
space
of
the
impeller,
which,
we
see
that,
this
is
here,
3,
is
the
refrigerant
passage.
So,
refrigerant
from
one
to
other
impeller,
between
the
impellers,
it,
yeah,
from
one
to
other
impellers.
So,
it
is
passing
through,
then,
4,
is
the
vaneless
diffuser,
this
is,
what
we
are
referring
to,
is
the
vane
less
diffuser.
5
is
the
volute
casing,
right,
sorry,
5
is
the
volute
casing,
and
volute
casing
is
this
one,
right,
this
one
is
the
volute
casing,
right.
Obviously,
there
is
no
impeller
in
this,
and
6,
that
is,
this
part,
5
is
the
volute
casing,
not
that
was
4,
sorry,
there
was
4,
this
was
4,
that
is
vaneless
diffuser,
and
5
is
this,
ok,
that
is,
volute
casing,
and
6
is
the
discharge
of
the
refrigerant,
right.
So,
if
we,
if
we
analyze
it,
afterwards,
we
see
that,
the
numbering,
we
have
already
said,
the
impeller,
then
numberof
blades,
which
is,
made
of
the
impeller,
and
which
form
the
flow
of
the
passages,
that
is,
through
the
number
3,
for
refrigerant,
right.
Then,
we
can
analyze
it,
that,
from
the
eye,
the
refrigerant
inlet,
or
refrigerant
enters
the
flow
passages,
formed
by
the
impeller
blades,
which,
rotate
at
very
high
speed.
As
the
refrigerant
flows
through
the
blade
passages
towards
the
tip
of
the
impeller,
it
gains
momentum,
and
its
static
pressure
also
increases.
From
the
tip
of
the
impeller,
the
refrigerant
flows
into
a
stationary
diffuser,
that
is,
which,
we
have
shown
as
number
4.
In
the
diffuser,
the
refrigerant
is
decelerated.
You
know,
acceleration,
which
is
increasing,
deceleration,
which
is
decreasing
the
flow,
or
velocity,
whatever
we
call.
So,
it
is
decelerated,
and
as
a
result,
the
dynamic
pressure
drop
is
converted
into
static
pressure
rise.
Thus,
increasing
the
volute
casing,
that
is,
content
5,
where,
further
conversion
of
velocity
into
static
pressure
takes
place,
due
to
the
divergent
shape
of
the
volute.
Similarly,
the
pressurized
refrigerant,
that
leaves
the
compressor
from
the
volute
casing,
6.
The
gain
in
momentum
is
due
to
the
transfer
of
momentum
from
the
high
speed
impeller
blades
to
the
refrigerant,
confined
between
the
blade
passages,
that
is,
3,
which
we
had
shown.
Increase
in
static
pressure
is
due
to
the
shelf
compression,
caused
by
the
centrifugal
action,
because
under
the
centrifugal
action,
constantly
it
is
rotating.
This
is
analogous
to
the
gravitational
effect,
where
gravitational
effect
means,
you
have
this
much
of
material,
so
that,
the
pressure
is
also
built
up,
because
of
the
material,
right,
weight
of
the
material,
right,
that
is,
how
we
call
it
to
be
gravity.
So,
this
is
analogous
to
the
gravitational
effect,
which
causes
the
fluid
at
a
higher
level
to
press
the
fluid,
which
causes
the
fluid
at
higher
level,
ok,
which
causes,
or
rather,
press
the
fluid
below
which
is
already
there,
below
it,
due
to
the
gravity,
or
by
its
weight.
The
static
pressure
produced
in
the
impeller
is
equal
to
the
static
head,
which
would
be
produced
by
an
equivalent
gravitational
column.
If
we
assume,
the
impeller
blades
to
be
radial,
and
the
inlet
diameter
of
the
impeller
to
be
small,
then,
the
static
head,
that
is,
h
developed
in
the
impeller
passage,
for
a
single
stage,
can
be
written
as
h
is
equal
to
V
square
by
g,
right.
So,
if
that
be
true,
then,
we
have,
of
course,
has
to,
we
have
to
say,
what
is,
what
that
is?
h
is
the
static
head
developed,
that
in
terms
of
meter,
right,
like
h
rho
g,
then,
V
is
the
peripheral
velocity
of
the
impeller.
So,
we
have
said,
angular
velocities.
Angular
velocity
can
be
converted
into
peripheral
velocity,
right.
So,
this
peripheral
velocity
of
the
impeller
will,
or
tip
speed
in
terms
of
meter
per
second,
and
g
is
of
course,
the
gravitational
force
due
to
the
gravity,
that
is,
meter
per
second
square.
So,
we
can
increase
in
total
pressure,
that
is,
delta
p,
as
the
refrigerant
flow
through
the
passage,
is
given
by
delta
p,
is
rho
gh,
and
that
is
equal
to
rho
V
square,
right.Where,
h
=
static
head
developed,
m;
V
=
peripheral
velocity
of
the
impeller
wheel
or
tip
speed,
m/s;
g
=
acceleration
due
to
gravity,
m/s
2
So,
we
can
say,
that
can
be
seen
that,
for
a
given
refrigerant,
with
a
fixed
density,
the
pressure
rise,
that
depends
only
on
the
peripheral
velocity,
or
tip
speed
of
the
blade.
This,
please
keep
in
mind
that,
it
can
be
seen
that,
for
a
given
refrigerant,
with
a
fixed
density,
the
pressure
rise
depends
only
on
the
peripheral
velocity,
or
tip
speed
of
the
blade.
The
tip
speed
of
the
blade
is
proportional
to
the
rotational
speed,
that
is,
rpm
of
the
impeller,
and
the
impeller
diameter,
the
maximum
permissible
tip
speed
is
limited
by,
of
course,
the
strength
of
the
structural
material
of
the
blade.
Usually,
it
is
made
of
high
speed
chrome
nickel
steel.
Obviously,
if
the
structure
gets
burst,
then
no
point.
So,
it
can
go
to
that,
where,
the
peripheral
speed
could
be
as
high.
So,
that
the
limiting
condition
is
the
strength
of
the
structural
material,
and
the
sonic
velocity
of
the
refrigerant.
Since,
we
are
not
having
time,
but
sonic
velocity,
if
you
go
to
my
another
course,
which,
has
already
been
given,
and
it
is
available
in
NPTEL,
where,
both
fluid
flow
and
heat
transfer,
I
have
covered
a
little
mass
transfer
also.
So,
there
you
will
see
that,
the
sonic
velocity
is
the
velocity
of
sound
in
air,
right.
Velocity
of
sound
in
air.
You
have
heard
the
siren,
if
you
are
nearby
of
any
industry,
right,
or
of
course,
there
is
no
such
fighting,
or
I
should
not
say
fighting,
there
is
no
such
war,
where,
earlier
this
siren
used
to
be
blown,
to
warn
the
people.
However,
so
that
is
the
sonic
velocity.
So,
these
are
the
two
controlling
limit,
that
how
much
peripheral
speed
can
go
up?
Under
these
limiting
conditions,
the
maximum
achievable
pressure
rise?
So,
hence,
it
can
be
said
to
be
maximum
achievable
temperature
lift,
because,
pressure
is
also
going
up,
temperature
is
also
going
up
for
a
given
volume
of
the
single
stage
centrifugal
compressor ,
and
that
is,
limited
for
a
given
refrigerant.
Hence,
multistage
centrifugal
compressors
are
used
for
large
temperature
lift,
or
rise
of
the,
lift
means,
rise
applications.
In
multistage
centrifugal
compressors,
the
discharge
of
the
lower
stage
compressor
is
fed
to
the
inlet
of
the
next
stage
compressor ,
right,
and
so
on.
In
the
multistage
centrifugal
compressors,
the
impeller
diameter
of
all
stages
remain
same,
but
the
width
of
the
impeller
becomes
progressively
narrow
in
the
direction
of
flow,
as
refrigerant
density
increases
progressively ,
right.
Then,
we
come
to,
the
blades
of
the
compressor
are
either
forward
curved,
or
backward
curved,
or
radial.
So,
backward
curved
blades
were
used
in
the
older
compressors,
whereas,
the
modern
centrifugal
compressors
use
mostly
radial
blades.
The
stationary
diffuser
can
be
vane,
or
vane
less,
as
the
name
implies
in
vaned
diffusers,
vanes
are
used
in
the
diffuser
to
form
flow
passages,
the
vanes
can
be
fixed
or
it
can
also
be
adjustable.
Vaned
diffusers
are
compared,
or
it
is
compact,
rather,
compared
to
the
vane
less
diffuser,
and
are
commonly
used
for
high
discharge
pressure
applications,
right.
So,
vane
less
diffusers,
vane
diffusers,
are
much
more
compact
than
that
of
the
vane
less,
or
rather,
that
of
the
vane
one,
right.
Vaned
diffusers
are
compact,
vanned
diffusers
are
compact,
compared
to
the
vane
less
type,
and
are
commonly
used
for
high
discharge
pressure
applications.
However,
the
presence
of
vanes
in
the
diffusers
can
give
rise
to
shocks,
as
the
refrigerant
velocities
at
the
tip
of
the
impeller
blade,
could
reach
sonic
velocities,
right,
in
large.
So,
high
speed
centrifugal
compressors,
it
could
be
up
to
the
sonic
velocities,
that
is
why,
it
may
lead
to
producing
a
shock.
In
vane
less
diffusers,
the
velocity
of
refrigerant
in
the
diffuser,
decreases,
and
static
pressure
increases,
as
the
radius
increases,
as
a
result,
for
required
pressure
rise,
the
required
size
of
the
vane
less
diffuser
could
be
large,
compared
to
vanned
diffuser.
However,
the
problem
of
shock,
due
to
supersonic
velocities
at
the
tip,
does
not
arise
with
vane
less
diffusers,
at
the
velocity,
as
the
velocity
can
be
diffused
smoothly.
In
this
case
also,
another
term
has
come
up
that
is
supersonic.
So,
I
said
sonic
velocity
that
is
the
velocity
of
sound
in
air.
Supersonic
and
subsonic,
there
are
two
types.
So,
supersonic
is
that,
where
the
velocity
of
sound
is
higher
than
that
of
the
sonic
velocity,
whereas,
subsonic
velocity
is
lower
than
that
of
the
sonic
velocity,
and
these
are
expressed
in
terms
of
Mach
number,
right.
Let
me
write
in
terms
of
Mach
number,
M
A
C
H,
Mach
number,
and
when,
this
is
normally
expressed
as
Mach
number,
Mach
number
is
1.
It
is
sonic
velocity,
when
Mach
number
is
greater
than
1,
it
is
supersonic
velocity,
and
when
Mach
number
is
less
than
1,
it
is
subsonic
velocity,
right.
So,
if
you
again,
as
I
said,
if
you
are
really
interested,
you
can
consult,
by
another,
this
thing.
We
can
say
that
the
presence
of
vanes
in
the
diffusers
can
give
rise
to
shocks
as
the
refrigerant
velocities,
at
the
tip
of
the
impeller
blade,
could
reach
sonic
velocities,
in
large,
high
speed
centrifugal
compressors,
right.
In
vane,
in
vane
less
diffusers,
the
velocity
of
refrigerant
in
the
diffuser
decreases,
and
static
pressure
increases,
as
the
radius
increases.
As
a
result,
for
a
required
pressure
rise,
the
required
size
of
vane
less
diffuser
could
be
large,
compared
to
the
vane
diffusers.
However,
the
problem
of
shock
due
to
supersonic
velocities,
at
the
tip,
does
not
arise
with
the
vane
less
diffusers,
as
the
velocity
can
be
diffused
smoothly.
Then,
we
can
say,
generally,
as
adjustable
guide,
vanes
or
pre
rotation
vanes
are
added
at
the
inlet,
that
is,
at
the
eye
of
the
centrifugal
compressor
of
the
impeller
for
capacity
control.
And
if
we
analyze
the
centrifugal
compressor ,
then,
we
can
say
that,
applyingenergy
balance
to
the
compressor ,
right,
we
obtain
from
steady
flow
energy
equation.
We
obtain
steady
flow
energy
equation.
So
let
us
look
at
the
compressor ,
which
we
are
saying.
So
we
are
doing
analysis
of
this,
this
is
the
centrifugal
compressor ,
right
this
is
the
centrifugal
compressor ,
and
this
is
the
inlet.
So,
this
is
the
exit,
so,
Q
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
and
W
c
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
system.
We
know
this
arrow
is
on
the
system,
and
this
arrow
is
by
the
system,
right,
that
we
have
seen
earlier.
So,
we
can
say
that,
from
this
figure,
analyzing
the
figure,
we
can
say
that
minus
Q
plus
m
into
h
i
plus
v
i
square
by
2
plus
g
z
I,
that
is
equal
to
minus
W
c
plus,
rather,
minus
W
c
plus
m
into
h
e,
exit,
plus
v
e
square
by
2
plus
g
z
e.
If
you
remember,
we
had
earlier
said
that,
this
type
of
equation,
we
said
it
to
be
Bernoulli's
equation,
right.
So,
we
can
say,
then,
that,
of
course,
the
terms
are
Q
is
heat
transfer
rate
from
the
compressor ,
W
c
is
the
work
transfer
rate
from
the
compressor ,
m
is
the
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant,
v
I,
v
e
are
inlet
and
outlet
velocities
of
the
compressor
refrigerant,
and
z
i
and
z
e
are
height
above
a
determinary
gravitational
force
field.
where
Q
=
heat
transfer
rate
from
the
compressor 
W
=
work
transfer
rate
to
the
compressor 
m
=
mass
flow
rate
of
the
refrigerant 
V
i
,
V
e
=
Inlet
and
outlet
velocities
of
the
refrigerant 
Z
i
,
Z
e
=
Height
above
a
datum
in
gravitational
force
field
at
inlet
and 
outlet
So,
equating,
if
it
is
horizontal,
then,
obviously,
we
do
not
have
this
g
z,
and
this,
ok.
If
this
is
also
can
be
neglected,
so,
we
can
write
minus
Q
plus
m
h
i,
that
is,
equal
to
minus
W
c
plus
m
h
e
right.
So,
in
that
case,
we
can
write
that,
in
a
centrifugal
compressor ,
the
heat
transfer
rate
Q
is
normally
negligible,
as
the
area
available
for
heat
transfer
is
small
compared
to
other
energy
terms.
So,
the
rate
of
compressor
work
input
for
adiabatic
compression,
that
can
be
given
as
W
c
equal
to
m
into
h
e
minus
h
i,
exit,
and
inlet
enthalpies.
So,
the
above
equation
is
valid
for
both
reversible
as
well
as
irreversible
adiabatic
compression,
provided
the
actual
enthalpy
is
used
at
the
exit
in
case
of
irreversible
compression.
In
case
of
reversible
adiabatic
compression,
the
power
input
to
the
compressor
is
given
by
W
c
isentropic,
is
equal
to
m
into
h
e
minus
h
I,
isentropic.
Then
using
that
thermodynamic
relation,
earlier
we
have
done,
T
d
S
equal
to
d
h
minus
V
d
p,
the
isentropic
work
of
compression,
that
can
be
given
by
W
isentropic
is
equal
to,
W
c
isentropic
is
equal
to
h
e
minus
h
I,
isentropic,
that
is
equal
to
integral
of
V
d
p
within
the
limit
p
i
to
p
e
and
under
isentropic
condition.
Thus,
the
expression
for
reversible
isentropic
work
of
compression
is
same,
for
both
reciprocating
as
well
as
centrifugal
compressors.
If
you
go
back
to
reciprocating,
you
will
see
the
same.
However,
the
basic
difference
between
actual
reciprocating
compressors,
and
actual
centrifugal
compressors
lie
in
the
source
of
irreversibility .
…

Tds=dh–vdp
…
(7)
In
case
of
reciprocating
compressors,
the
irreversibility
is
mainly
due
to
heat
transfer
and
pressure
drops
across
the
bulbs,
and
connecting
pipelines.
However,
in
case
of
centrifugal
compressors,
since
the
refrigerant
has
to
flow
at
very
high
velocities,
through
the
impeller
blade
passages,
for
a
finite
pressure
rise,
the
major
source
of
irreversibility
is
due
to
the
viscous
shear
stresses
at
the
interface,
between
the
refrigerant
and
the
impeller
blade
surface,
right.
So,
in
reciprocating
compressors,
the
work
is
required
to
overcome
the
normal
forces
acting
against
the
piston.
While
in
centrifugal
compressors,
work
is
required
to
overcome
both
normal
pressure
forces,
as
well
as,
viscous
shear
forces.

That
means,
if
this
is
equal
to
vdP
integral,
under
Pi
to
Pe
over
h
e
minus
h
I,
where,
obviously,
W
poly
and
W
act,
are
the
polytrophic,
and
actual
work
of
compression
respectively ,
right.
So,
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
centrifugal
compressor ,
and
our
time
is
also
over.
So,
next,
perhaps,
we
will
go
over
the
other,
ok.
Thank
you
so
much.
