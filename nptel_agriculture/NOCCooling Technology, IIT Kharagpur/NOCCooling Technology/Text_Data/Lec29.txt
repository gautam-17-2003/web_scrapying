Carnot Refrigeration Cycles
Good
afternoon
my
dear
friends
and
students.
We
have
finished,
Carnot
cycle
with
heat
engine.
Now ,
we
will
go
to
another
new
one,
that
is
called,
Carnot
refrigeration
cycles,
right.
So,
this
is
the
first
class,
obviously ,
it
will
also
take
some
classes.
It
is
not
that;
in
one
class
it
will
be
over.
So
Carnot
refrigeration
cycles,
we
will
start
with,
we
have
done
with,
Carnot
heat
engines.
For
refrigeration
cycles
we
need
to
know
some
of
the
things,
right.
Again,
let
us
take
it
back
to
this
side.
Otherwise,
it
will
be
difficult.
So,
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle
is
a
completely
reversible
cycle.
Hence,
it
is
used
as
a
model
of
performance,
or
perfection
for
a
refrigeration
cycle,
operating
between
constant
temperature
heat
source
and
heat
sink.
It
is
used
as
reference,
against
which,
the
real
cycles are always compared to, right.
;
So
one
figure,
like
figure
1
A,
and
B,
it
will
show
the
schematic
of
a
Carnot
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system,
and
the
operating
cycle
on
T-S
diagram.
Already
S,
we
have
defined,
S
is
the
entropy
obviously ,
T
is
the
temperature.
So
temperature
entropy
diagram,
if
we
see
the
figure.
So,
it
is
figure
A,
as
it
is
seen
from
here,
it
is
figure
A.
We
have
a
heat
source,
Q
e,
we
have
a
heat
sink,
that
is,
Q
c,
we
have
one
compressor ,
we
have
one
turbine
right.
So,
these
are
the
4
units,
that
is,
compressor ,
condenser ,
turbine expansion and evaporator .
These
are
the
4
units
of
the
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
the
other
one,
and
this
is
figure
1
A,
because,
please
remember
that,
this
is
the
point
1,
this
is
the
point
1,
this
is
point
2,
that
is
before
the
compressor ,
1,
after
the
compressor ,
2,
then,
before
the
expansion
device,
3,
and
before
the
evaporator ,
it
is
4.
So,
the
cycle
will
be
1
to
2
to
3
to
4
back
to
1
right.
So,
that
will
show
in
a
pictorial
view ,
just
this.
I
am
repeating,
because,
you
keep
in
mind,
all
the
time,
it
may
not
be
possible,
we
will
be
going
to
and
fro.
So,
the next one is 1 B, and that is under the T S diagram.
So,
this
is
temperature
versus
entropy ,
right
and
as
you
see,
this
is
the
dome,
right.
This
is
the
dome,
someday ,
I
told
that,
I
will
show
you
how
these
domes
are
easily
created
through
software,
nowadays
available,
but
yeah,
these
are
to
be,
of
course,
obtained,
or
bought
from
the
market.
So,
a
T
S
diagram,
where
this
is
the,
sorry ,
this
is
the
state
point,
1,
this
is
state
point,
2,
this
is
state
point,
3
and
this
is
state
point,
4.
So
Q
e
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied,
W
1
-
2
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
system,
Q
c
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
ambient,
or
environment
and
W
3
-
4
is
obtained
as
work,
right.
So,
this
is
the
cycle
and
also
some
more
things,
which
you
require
very
much,
that
is,
the
temp,
pressure
is
P
e
at
the
point
1,
and
pressure
is
P
c
at
the
point
2,
right,
and
these
are
those
pressure lines, right and this, we will describe, we will say more in detail.
So,
the
two
diagrams,
we
have
shown,
one
is
T
S
diagram
and
another
is
the
one,
diagram
for
the
Carnot
refrigeration
system
right.
So,
if
we
go
back,
if
we
go
back,
this
was
the
schematic
diagram.
So,
if
we
are
going
back
to
the
original,
where,
we
said
that
figures
1
A
and
1
B
show
the
schematic
of
Carnot
vapor
compression
refrigeration
system,
and
operating
cycle,
on
a
T
S
diagram.
So,
as
it
is
shown
in
1
A,
the
basic
Carnot
refrigeration
system
for
pure
vapor ,
that
consists
of
4
components,
number
1,
compressor ,
number
2,
condenser ,
number
3,
turbine
and
number
4,
is
the
evaporator .
Refrigeration
effect,
that
is
Q
4
–
1,
equivalent
to
Q
e,
is
obtained
at
the
evaporator ,
as
the
refrigerant
under goes the process.
This
process
is
vaporization
of
the
substance,
that
is,
this
process
4
–
1,
and,
extracts
the
latent
heat,
from
the
low
temperature
heat
source.
The
low
temperature,
low
pressure
vapor
is
then,
compressed
isentropically ,
right
isentropically
means,
entropy
is
constant.
In
the
compressor ,
to
the
heat
sink
temperature,
that
is,
T
c.
The
refrigerant
pressure
increases
from
P
e
to
P
c,
which,
I
have
shown
during
the
compression
process,
that
is,
process
1
–
2,
and
the
exit
vapor
is
saturated.
Next,
the
high
pressure,
high
temperature
saturated
refrigerant
under goes
the
process
of
condensation,
in
the
condenser ,
that
is,
process
2
–
3,
as
it
rejects,
the
heat
of
condensation,
that
is,
Q
c
or
Q
2
-
3
is
equal
to
Q
c.
So, it is rejected to an external heat sink at temperature T c.
The
heat,
rather ,
the
high
pressure,
that
is,
saturated
liquid,
then
follows
through
the,
or
rather ,
it
flows
through
the
turbine
and
under goes
isentropic
expansion,
that
is,
process
3
-4.
And
during
this
process,
the
pressure
and
temperature
fall,
from
P
c
T
c
to
P
e
T
e,
that
is,
P
c,
corresponds
to
pressure
at
the
condenser ,
T
c
corresponds
to
temperature
at
the
condenser ,
and
P
e
corresponds
to
pressure
at
the
evaporator ,
and
T
e
corresponds
to
temperature
at
the
evaporator .
Since,
saturated
liquid
is
expanded
in
the
turbine,
some
amount
of
liquid
flashes
out,
and
it
forms
into
vapor ,
and
the
exit
condition
lies
in
the
two
phase,
right.
So,
this
two
phase
region,
exit
condition,
it
should
be
as
low
as
possible,
because
two
phase,
it
is
very
difficult
to
analyze
right.
So,
for
the
simplicity ,
we
are
saying
that,
at
this
very
moment,
that
two
phase,
are
minimum,
or
minimal
two
phases.
So
that,
it
can
be
overlooked,
or
it
can
be
neglected.
However ,
that
this,
as
it
is
seen,
from
the
T
s
diagram,
the
cycle
involves,
two
isothermal
heat
transfer
processes,
that
is,
process
4
–
1,
and
process
2
–
3,
and
two
isentropic
work
transfer
processes,
that
is,
process
1
–
2,
and
process
3
-
4.
Heat
is
extracted
isothermally
at
evaporator
temperature,
that
is,
T
e
during
the
process
4
–
1,
and
heat
is
rejected
isothermally ,
at
constant
temperature,
that
is,
T
c
during
process
2
-
3.
Work
is
supplied
to
the
compressor
during
the
isentropic
compression,
that
is,
from
state
point
1
to
2
of
the
refrigerant.
Vapor
from
or
refrigerant
vapor ,
rather ,
from
evaporator
pressure,
P
e
to
the
compressor
pressure,
P
c,
and
work
is
produced
by
the
system,
as
refrigerant
liquid
expands
isentropically ,
in
the
turbine
from
the
condenser
pressure,
P
c
to
the
evaporator
pressure, P  e.
All
the
processes
are
both,
internally
as
well
as
externally
reversible.
This
is
a
must,
that
is,
net
entropy
generation
for
the
system
and
the
environment
is
0.
As,
we
have
shown,
during
entropy
definition,
that
entropy ,
the
moment
it
is
increasing
is
showing
that,
the
system
is
under going
chaotic
condition.
So,
when
it
is
0,
that
means,
system
is
stable,
that
net
entropy
generation
for
the
system
and
environment
is
0.
Now ,
applying
first
and
second
law
of
thermodynamics
to
the
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle,
we
can
write,
we
can
say,
that,
del
Q
is
equal
to
Q
1
4
2
1,
minus
Q
2
2
2
2
3.
So,
it
is
Q
e
minus
Q
c,
and
del
W,
integral
of
dQ,
was
Q
4
2
1
minus
Q
2
2
3,
and
is
equal
to
Q
e
minus
Q
c,
and
del
W,
integral
of
del
W,
is
W
3
-
4
minus
W
1
–
2,
which
is
W
turbine,
W
t
minus
W
c,
that
is,
equal to W net.
Therefore,
we
can
say,
W
net
is
equal
to
Q
c
minus
Q
e.
This
we
keep
in
mind
that,
W
net
is
equal
to
Q
c
minus
Q
e,
right
and
this
was
our
schematic,
which
I
said,
and
this
is,
our
T-S
diagram
right.
Now ,
for
the
reversible
isothermal
heat
transfer
process
2
-,
3
and
4
–
1,
we
can
write
that
Q
c
minus
Q
2
–
3,
Q
c,
equal
to
Q
minus
Q
2
–
3,
is
equal
to
minus,
is
equal
to
minus
2
–
3,
integral
T
dS,
and
that
is,
equal
to
T
c
into
S
2
minus
S
3,
right.
This
we
have
given,
a
number
of
equation
number
2,
and
if
we
remember ,
what
was
that
equation
number
1,
is
this,
that
is,
W
net
is
W
t
minus
W
c,
that
was
W
minus
W
net,
right,
that
was
said
to
be
equation
number
1,
that
is
W
net
is
W
t
minus
W
c
right.
W
t
was
the
work
of
turbine
and
W
c
is
the
work
of
compressor .
So,
equation
number
2,
has
become
that,
Q
c
is
minus
Q
2
-
3
is
equal
to
integral
of
minus
2
to
3
T
dS,
and
that
is,
T
c
into
S
2
minus
S
3
equivalent
to
equation
number
2,
right,
and
Q
e
is
Q
4
–
1,
that
we
can
write,
integral
between
4
–
1,
T
dS,
and
is
equal
to
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4,
is
the
equation  number 3.
Obviously ,
the
T
e
and
T
c
are
the
evaporator
and
condenser
temperatures,
respectively .
Now ,
since,
this
is
isentropic,
so,
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2.
This
was
our
point
2,
and
this
was
our
point
1,
right
this
was
our
point
2,
and
this
was
our
point
1,
right.
So,
it
is
isentropic,
so,
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2,
and
this
is
2,
this
is
3,
this
is
4,
this
is
1
back.
So,
this
is
4,
this
is
3.
So,
again
this
3
to
4
is
isentropic
because
it
is
under
T
S
diagram
right
this
was
T
and
this is S right.
So,
this
is
isentropic,
this
is
isentropic,
this
is
isothermal,
this
is
isothermal.
So,
between
point
3
–
4,
it
is
isentropic
so,
that
is
why,
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4.
The
coefficient
of
performance
or
COP,
that
can
be
written,
as
COP
Carnot
is
equal
to
refrigeration
effect
over
net
work
out
input.
So,
how
much
you
are
giving
and
how
much
you
are
getting,
that
is
the
efficiency .
So,
COP
is
expressed,
that,
the
refrigeration
or
refrigeration
effect
obtained
over
the
net
work
input,
how
much
work
you
have
given,
and
how
much
refrigeration
effect
you
have
obtained.
The
ratio
of
this
two
of
the
refrigeration
effect
obtained over the work input, you have given, that is the  COP  right.
Then
we
can
write
that
COP
of
Carnot
is
equal
to
refrigeration
effect
given
or
obtained
over
the
net
work
input
right,
and
this
can
be
written
as
Q
e
over
W
net
right.
So,
that
is
equal
to
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4
S
1
minus
S
4
over
T
c
into
S
1
minus
S,
S
2
minus
S
3,
minus
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4
right.
So,
this
can
be
written
as,
this
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4,
if
you
remember
that,
from
here
this
is
equal
to
Q
e
right,
and
T
c
into
S
2
minus
S
3,
this
one
is
Q
c,
right.
So,
it
is
Q,
it
is
Q
e
over
Q
c
minus
Q
e
right.
So,
this
is
what
exactly
we
have.
Therefore,
we
can
say
that
the
COP
of
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle
is
equal
to
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4
over
T
c
into
S
2
minus
S
3
minus
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4
and
that
is
equal
to
T
e
over
T
c
minus
T
e
that
is,
T
e
over
T
c
minus
T
e,
T
e
over
T
c
minus
T
e
because,
S
1
minus
S
4,
S
2
minus
S
3
and
S
1
minus
S
4,
we
have
said
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2 right.,
So,
that
means,
it
becomes
S
2
minus
S
4
and
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4,
S
1
is
S
2,
and
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4.
So,
we
can
write
it
to
be
S
1
minus
S
4,
right
and
this
is
also
S
1
minus
S
4.
So,
if
you
take
common
S
1
minus
S
4
we
have
in
the
denominator
T
c
minus
T
e,
and
numerator
we
have
S
1
minus
S
4.
So,
it
cancels
out.
It
is,
T
e
by
Q
c
minus
T
e
by
T
c
minus
T
L,
right
this
is
T
e
by
T
c
minus
T
L,
that
is
the
COP
of
the
Carnot
Refrigeration
cycle, right. So, we have established, what is the Carnot Refrigeration cycle, right.
Now ,
we
can
say
that
the
COP
of
Carnot
Refrigeration
cycle
is
a
function
of
evaporator
and
condenser
temperatures
only,
and
condenser
temperatures
only,
and
it
is
independent
of
the
nature
of
the
working
substance.
The
Carnot
COP
sets
up,
or
sets
an
upper
limit
for
refrigeration
systems
operating
between
two
constant
temperature
thermal
reservoirs
that
is
heat
source
and
heat
sink.
From
Carnot's
theorem,
for
the
same
heat
source
and
heat
sink
temperatures.
No
irreversible
cycle
can
have
COP
higher
than
that
of
the
Carnot
COP
right.
So,
our
time
is
almost
over.
So,
let
us
just
have
a
recapitulation
that,
we
started
with,
in
the
T-S
diagram,
because,
this
is
what,
subsequently ,
we
will
be
doing
that
in
the
T-S
diagram,
this
is
the
dome
we
have
0.1,
we
have
0.2,
we
have
0.3,
we
have
0.4.
This
is
isentropic,
this
is
also
isentropic,
this
is
isothermal
and
this
is
isothermal.
So,
two
isentropic
and
two
isothermal
processes,
we
had
right,
and
the
temperatures
are
one
is
T
e,
that
is,
evaporator
temperature,
one
is
T
e
that
is,
evaporator
temperature
and
another
is
T
c,
that
is
condenser
temperature,
right
and
pressures
are
P
e
and
P
c
right.
And
since,
it
is
isentropic,
we
said
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2,
and
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4,
and
that
is
the
reason,
why
this,
if
we
keep
this
in
mind,
that
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2
and
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4,
we
have
found
out
that,
this
one
S
1,
is
S
2
and
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4,
this
we
found
out.
So,
we
defined
COP
as
the
refrigeration
effect
to
that,
the
work
input
and
this
was
Q
e
over
W
net,
and
this
was
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4
over
T
c
into
S
2
minus
S
3
and
minus
T
e
into
S
1
minus
S
4,
that
came
out
to
be
T
e
over
T
c
minus
T
e,
and
this
is
the
Carnot
COP,
and
for
reversible
refrigeration
cycle
Carnot
COP
is
the
maximum,
and
is
taken
as
the
datum,
or
as
the,
as
the,
not
datum
as
the
one,
which
may
be
achieved,
which
is
to
be
achieved
right.
So,
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
this
period.
So,
I
am
thankful
to
you
for
your
listening.
Thank you all.
