The Carnot Cycle (Contd.)
Good
morning.
We
have
been
talking
about
Carnot
cycle,
and
perhaps,
in
the
previous
class,
we
had
gone
up
to
single
cycle
right.
From
there,
we
went
to
one
reversible,
and
one
irreversible
cycle,
under
the
same
reservoirs,
hot
reservoir
and
cold
reservoir
right.
Now ,
if
we
analyze
them,
and
subsequently
we
will
see
actually ,
our,
now,
aim
is
to
show
that
the
Carnot
refrigeration,
Carnot
cycle
of
course,
we
are
talking
about
Carnot
heat
engines,
when
we
will
come
to
refrigeration,
then
also
we
will
see,
but
we
everywhere,
we
cannot
show
the
same
thing.
So,
here,
our
objective
is
that,
we
will
like
to
show ,
reversible
cycles
have
higher
efficiency
than
that
of
the
irreversible
cycle,
that
we
will
establish,
for
which,
in
the
previous
class,
we
stopped
here,
that
is,
at
hot
reservoir
and
cold
reservoir
with
the
same
reservoir ,
if
reversible
engine,
and
one
irreversible
engine
working
under
the
same
two
reservoirs,
right.
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
reservoir ,
say,
reversible
engine,
and
W
R
quantity
of
work
is
done
by
the
engine
and
Q
C quantity of heat is rejected by the reversible engine  equivalent to Q H minus W R.
Now ,
the
same
reservoir
has
given
Q
c
rather
rather
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
to
the
irreversible
engine
and
W
i
quantity
of
work
done
by
the
engine
and
Q
dot
c
quantity
of
heat
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
I
has
been
rejected
by
the
irreversible
engine
to
the
cold
reservoir
like
the
reversible
engine
right.
So,
this
is
the
place
where
we
stopped
in
the
previous
class.
Now
from
there
we
can
say
the
Carnot's
first
corollary
and
that
first
corollary
is
saying
that
each
engine
receives
identical
amounts
of
heat
that
is
Q
H
and
produces
W
R
quantity
of
work
or
W
I
quantity
of
work
right.
So,
each
engine
receives
identical
amounts
of
heat
that
is
Q
H
and
produces
W
R
quantity
of
work
for
the
reversible engine and W I quantity of work for the irreversible engine  right.Then
we
can
also
say
that
each
engine
or
each
of
them
dischar ges
an
amount
of
Q
quantity
of
heat
to
the
cold
reservoir
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
heat
it
receives
and
the
work
it
produces.
If
you
remember
that
we
had
said
that
Q
W
sorry
Q
Q
Q
Q
H
is
equal
to
Q
H
no
amount
of
heat
Q
this
is
which
is
rejected.
So,
it
is
Q
C,
Q
C
is
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W
R,
for
reversible
engine
and
for
irreversible
engine
we
said
Q
C
prime
is
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W
I,
this
is
Q
C
prime,
right.
This
W
I
is
for
irreversible
engine.
So,
first
corollary
of
Carnot,
we
have
said
that
each
receives,
each
engine
receives
identical
amounts
of
heat
equivalent
to
Q
H
and
produces
W
R
quantity
of
work
or
W
I
quantity
of
work
and
it
rejects
the
heat
to
the
cold
reservoir
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
R
for
reversible
engine,
and
Q
dot
C
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
I
right.
So,
from
there,
then,
we
can
go
to
one,
where,
we
have
again
two
identical
reservoirs,
that
is
hot
reservoir ,
two
identical
reservoirs,
that
is
hot
reservoir
and
cold
reservoir .
These
two
are
identical,
and
we have same reversible engine and irreversible engine right.
Now ,
in
the
first
case,
as
we
can
see
that,
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine,
and
W
R
quantity
of
heat,
rather
work
is
done
by
the
engine,
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir ,
and
that
is
equivalent
to
Q
C
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W
R,
right.
this
is
for
the
reversible
engine.
Now ,
if
we
do
the
reverse,
if
we
do
the
reverse,
what
is
that
reverse?
Reverse
is
that,
if
we
supply
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
to
the
reversible
engine
and
W
R
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
reversible
engine,
then
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
can
be
rejected
to
the
hot
reservoir ,
right.
So,
from
the
cold
reservoir ,
if
we
draw
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
and
supply
it
to
the
reversible
engine,
then
W
R
quantity
of
work
has
to
be
done
on
the
reversible
engine,
so
that,
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
hot
reservoir ,
right.
Now ,
this
is
again
leading
us
to
one,
in
earlier ,
if
we
remember
that,
we
have
said
the
first
one,
that
is,
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine,
W
R
quantity
of
work
is
done
by
the
engine
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to the cold reservoir .
We
also
said
that
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine,
W
I
quantity
of
work
is
done
by
the
irreversible
engine
and
Q
dot
C
quantity
of
heat,
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
I
is
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir .
This
was
in
the
previous
slide,
which
I
showed
also
right.
Now ,
this
says
that,
then,
instead
of
instead
of
this
path,
if
we
had
done
this
path
right
and
if
we
reverse
it,
to
this
path,
then,
we
are
obtaining
the
same
Q
H,
then
this
Q
H
can
be
supplied
to
this
right.
So,
this
Q
H
can
be
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine
because
from
the
reversible
engine
we
had
supplied
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
and
W
R
quantity
of
work
obtained
from
the
engine
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
R.
Now ,
if
we
supply
the
reverse
way,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
to
the
reversible
engine,
and
if
W
R
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
system, then Q H quantity of heat is rejected to the hot  reservoir .
That
means,
whatever ,
we
had
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine,
that,
we
had
received
back,
and
we
are
using
it,
to
this
irreversible
engine,
right.
In
that
case,
the
corollary
of
the
Carnot,
that,
we
can
say,
under
this
condition
is
that,
this
taken
together ,
that
is
irreversible
and
reversible
engine
work,
that
is
W
R
plus
W
I.
If
we
add
up
to
them
then,
it
is
Q
H
minus
Q
C
plus
Q
H
minus
Q
dot
C,
right.
So,
W
R
plus
W
I
is
giving
us,
2
Q
H,
and
minus
2
Q
C
minus
Q
dot
C,
right
and
this
is
in
the
normal,
which
we
had
showed
earlier .
Let
me
go
back
and
show
you.
In
this,
we
had
supplied
Q
H
quantity
of
heat,
W
R quantity  of work was done by the reversible engine.
Here
also,
we
had
supplied
Q
H
quantity
of
heat,
and
we
received
W
I
quantity
of
work
from
the
irreversible
engine,
and
in
both
the
cases,
reversible
engine
rejected
Q
C
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
R
quantity
of
heat
to
the
cold
reservoir ,
and
Q
dot
C
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W
I
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir
by
the
irreversible
engine,
right.
So,
this
was
our
normal.
So,
and
we
have
added
these
two
and
showed
you
that
W
R
plus
W
I,
if
we
add
up
them.
So,
W
R
plus
W
I.
So,
this
is
Q
H
minus
Q
C
plus
Q
H
minus
Q
dot
C
right.
You
refer
to
the
reversible,
and
irreversible
engine,
we
had
just shown.
Now ,
if
we
reverse
the
reversible
engine,
which,
we
had
shown
in
the
previous
slide,
that
if
we
reverse
the
reversible
engine,
then
W
R
plus
W
I,
W
R
with
a
negative,
because,
work
was
done
on
the
system.
So,
this
was
there,
work
was
done
on
the
system.
So,
that
is
why,
W
R
is
negative,
W
I
was
is
positive,
because
we
got
Q
H
quantity
of
heat,
right
and
we
produced
W
I
quantity
of
work
by
the
irreversible
engine.
So,
these
two
are
added,
this
leads
to
minus
Q
H
plus
Q
C,
because
it
was
Q
C
minus
W
R.
If
you
remember ,
Q
H,
sorry
Q
H
minus
W
R
was
Q
C
right.
So,
the
reverse
way
W
R,
we
can
write is equal to Q C minus Q H right, Q C minus Q H, from  this relation we can write.
So,
that
is
what
we
have
written,
minus
Q
H
plus
Q
C,
and
for
the
irreversible
engine
the
second
one,
where,
we
have
supplied
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
W
I
quantity
of
work
obtained
and
we
got
Q
dot
C
quantity
of
heat
rejected
to
the
reservoir .
So,
we
can
write
that,
W
I
is
equal
to
directly
Q
H
minus
Q
dot
C
right,
because,
it
was
Q
dot
C
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W,
sorry ,
Q
H
yeah,
minus
W
I
right.
If
that
be
true,
then
we
can
write,
if
that
betrue
then
we
are
adding
up
the
reverse
of
the
reversible
engine,
right
This,
yeah,
this
is
now
clear .
So,
we
have,
we
have
reverse
the
reversible
engine,
and
that
is
how
we
got
this
W
R
minus
W
I
plus
and
if
we
substituted
them,
and
then,
we
see,
this
Q
H,
this
Q
H
goes
out
then
W
I
minus
W
R
this
becomes
equal
to
Q
C
minus
Q
dot
C
right.
So,
W
I
minus W R is Q C minus Q dot C, because Q H quantity of heat is a cancelled out, right.
So,
we
can
again
come
back
to
the
corollary
of
the
Carnot
and
that
says
this
we
have
which
I
so
told
earlier
I
had
written.
Now ,
it
is
being
shown
here
that,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
we
have
taken
from
the
cold
reservoir
W
R
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
reversible
engine.
Therefore,
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
hot
reservoir ,
but
instead
of
heat
going
to
the
hot
reservoir
if
you
direct
it
to
the
irreversible
engine,
that
same
quantity
of
Q
H,
then,
the
irreversible
engine
will
do
the
work
W
I
and
we
got
Q
C
dot
quantity
of
heat
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
I,
right.
So,
this
means
the
same
reversible
engine,
we
have
just
reversed,
it
is
reversible.
So,
we
can
reverse
and
in
the
reverse,
we
have
taken
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
from
the
cold
reservoir
supplied
to
the
reversible
engine
and
a
W
r
quantity
of
work
was
done
on
the
system,
because
of
that,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat,
we
could
reject
to
the
hot
reservoir ,
but
now
instead
of
hot
reservoir
we
directed
it
to
the
irreversible,
the
same
quantity
of
heat,
Q
H
to the irreversible engine, and W I quantity of work was done  by the irreversible engine.
So,
we
got
Q
dot
C
quantity
of
heat
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
I
right.
So,
instead
of
instead
of
two
reservoirs
single
reservoir
that
is
cold
reservoir
with
a
reversible
engine
and
our
irreversible
engine,
we
are
supplying
the
heat,
same
right.
Then
we
can
correlate
and
we
can
say
that
Carnot's
first
corollary
as
minus
W
r
plus
W
i
is
equal
to
plus
Q
C
minus
Q
dot
C
right.
So,
in
that
case
if
W
I
is
greater
than
W
R,
if
W
I
is
greater
than
W
R,
then
the
system
puts
out
net
work
and
exchanges
heat
with
one
reservoir ,
and
this
is
violating
the
K
P
statement,
that
Kelvin
Planck
statement,
it is violating.  So, W I cannot be greater than W R, how we arrived at.
So,
we
have
taken
both
the
work
from
the
reversible
and
irreversible,
but
in
the
reversible
one
we
took
the
reversed
path.
So,
W
R
quantity
of
heat
work
was
done
on
the
system.
So,
that
is
why
it
minus
W
R
and
W
I
quantity
of
heat
was
rather ,
the
work
was
done
by
the
irreversible
engine.
So,
that
is
Q
C
minus
Q
dot
C
right.
Then,
we
can
say,
if
W
I
is
greater
than
W
R
then,
W
I
minus
W
R
is
positive,
right,
is
positive
right,
which
means
that
the
heat
exchanges
or
work
and
heat
network
and
heat
exchanges
right
with
a
single reservoir .
Because,
we
started
with,
if
you
remember ,
we
started
with,
here,
right
that,
the
negative
work
was
done,
that
is
work
was
done
on
this
system.
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
was
supplied
and
the
Q
H
quantity
of
heat,
which
was
available,
was
supplied
to
the
irreversible
engine
and
it
worked.
W
I
quantity
of
work
obtained
from
the
engine,
and
Q
C
dot
quantity
of
heat,
right,
Q
C
dot
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected
to
the
same
single
reservoir ,
that
is,
the
primary ,
that
the
same
single
reservoir
is
used
for
the
exchange
of
the
heat
for
both
the
cases
of
reversible
and
irreversible
engines,
which
is
against,
the
Carnot,
which
is
against
the
Kelvin
Planck
statement.
So,
we
said
that,
if
W
I
is
greater
than
W
R,
then
it
is
to
be
worked
from
the
same
reservoir ,
which
is
not
feasible,
according
to
Kelvin
Planck
statement.
So,
we
can
see,
now,
that,
this
is
violating
the
Kelvin
Planck
statement.
Therefore,
W
I,
that
is,
work
from
the
irreversible
engine
cannot
be
greater
than
that
of
the
reversible
engine,
otherwise,
it
will,
it
will
violate
the
K
P
statement,
which
is
not
desirable,
which
is,
which
cannot
happen
rather .
So,
we
can
say
that,
with
this,
we
can
say,
we
have
done
with
single
reservoir ,
rather ,
with
two
reservoirs,
and
with
two
engines,
reversible
and
reversible
and
seen,
that,
W
R
and
W
I
quantity
of
heat
was
produced
by
both
the
engines,
and
Q
C
and
Q
dot
C
quantity
of
heat,
was
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir ,
from
the
hot
reservoir .
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
was
extracted,
right.
This
was
first,
then,
we
said,
since
we
have
reversible
engine,
so,
if
we
reverse
the
path,
instead
of
Q
C
coming
from
the
hot
reservoir ,
if
we
take
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
coming
from
the
hot
reservoir ,
if
we
take
Q
C
dot,
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
from
the
cold
reservoir ,
and
give
it
to
the
reversible
engine,
then
W
R
quantity
of
work
has
to
be
done
on
the
system
to
get
Q
H quantity of heat and that quantity of heat, we supplied to the irreversible engine.
So
that,
heat
produces
W
I
quantity
of
work,
and
Q
C
dot
quantity
of
heat
right.
So,
since
it
is
working
from
the
same
single
reservoir ,
this
is
violating
the
Planck
Kelvin
Planck
statement.
So,
W
I,
that
is,
workfromtheirreversibleengine,cannotbegreaterthan work from the reversible engine.
So, our time is up. So, we stop it here today .
Next, we will proceed  in the next class ok. Thank you.
