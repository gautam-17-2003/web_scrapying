So,
good
morning
my
dear
students
and.
Friends
who
are
in
the
class,
we
have
started
with
the
application
already
we
have
done
one
of
such
that
is
freezing.
Now,
we
come
to
another
application
that
is
called
controlled
atmosphere
storage,
right.
So,
in
this
controlled
atmosphere
(CA)
storage,
we
do
like
this,
that
the
ok,
these
are
some
information,
like
status
of
the
Indian,
typically
Indian
fruits
and
vegetables
production,
and
obviously,
its
maintenance
and
definitely
India
waste
more
fruits
and
vegetables
than
are
consumed
in
many
small
countries.
In
European
countries,
if
you
few
see
that,
many
countries
are
even
smaller
than
say,
West
Bengal,
or
say
Gujarat,
or
any
such,
right.
So,
there,
whatever,
our
production
being
so
high,
and
our
population
being
so
high,
consumption
is
also
definitely
little
high,
but
wastage
is
also
very
high,
and
this
wastage
is
not
that
you
are
buying
and
throwing
it
out.
It
is
at
the,
not
buyers
end,
at
the
producers
end,
because,
of
the
non
availability
of
the
proper
storage
facilities,
this
wastage
is
a
part
right.
Now,
obviously,
remedy
could
be
that,
efficient
storage
and
distribution
system,
if
you
can
have.
If
you
also
can
have
cold
chain,
this
cold
chain
will
also
say
sometime,
may
be
in
the
last
class,
when
ice
cream
will
be
covering
up.
Post-hustle
based
management,
that
is,
the
prime,
and
in
that
one,
such
remedy
could
be,
use
of
controlled
atmosphere
storage,
and
to
do
that,
a
new
thing,
which,
for
you
is,
rate
of
respiration,
to
know
that,
in
earlier
class,
perhaps
while
we
were
calculating
the
load
of
the
refrigeration,
there,
we
have
been
talking
all,
we
have
taken
this
rate
of
respiration
as
load,
right.
Obviously,
this
rate
of
respiration
is
associated
with
the
ripening
of
the
fruits,
right.
Obviously,
we
have
not
seen
vegetables
getting
ripened.
It
is
fruits,
and
that
too,
there
are
not
all
the
types
of
fruits,
which
are
ripened.
I
don't
know,
I
afterwards,
I
will
get
this
scope
or
not.
Let
me
say
one
thing
here
that,
if
you
see
the
rate
of
ripening,
sorry,
rate
of
respiration
with
time,
this
being
time,
then
there
will
be
a
graph
like
this,
and
coming
out
like
this.
This
typical
curve
is
known
as
the
respiration
curve,
or
climacteric
curve.
I
write
here,
C
L
I
M
A
C
T
E
R
I
C,
climacteric
curve,
right.
There
are
some
fruits,
andfruits
rather,
which
are
climacteric
in
nature,
some
fruits
which
are
not
climacteric
in
nature.
For
example,
if
you
take
guava,
I
am
sorry,
not
guava,
if
you
take
cucumber,
it
can
be
taken
either
as
fruit
or
as
vegetable.
So,
you
have
not
seen
that,
cucumber,
you
have
taken
and
the
colour,
whatever
it
has,
it
got
changed.
Yes,
with
time
it
may
shrunken,
or
it
may
get
damaged,
etc.,
but
it
did
not
change
the
colour,
unlike,
if
you
have
mango,
right.
Mango,
which
is
green
in
colour,
and
when
it
got
ripened,
it
is
yellow
in
colour,
one
of
the
best
example
of
ripening,
right.
So,
we
can
now
say
that,
once
you
have
the
remedy,
then
we
should
also
know
why
fruits
spoil,
right.
The
deterioration
of
fruit
is
associated
with
the
physicochemical
and
biochemical
activities,
and
the
living
cells
of
harvested
plant
products
respire
continuously
utilizing
oxygen
from
the
surrounding
environment
and
releasing
carbon
dioxide.
In
general,
there
is
an
inverse
relationship
between
respiration
rate
and
the
storage
life,
and
produced
with
no
respiration
rate,
generally,
have
longer
shelf
life.
This
is
what
I
was
referring
to,
right.
So,
this
is
rate
of
respiration,
or
rate
of
oxygen
consumption,
by
which,
we
say
that
rate
of
respiration,
this
is
rate
of
oxygen
consumption
with
time.
So,
you
see,
it
is
coming
down
going
up
and
then
this
is
the
starting.
We
have
harvested
from
the
tree
that,
the
mother
plant,
who
was
supplying
all
energy
everything
to
the
fruit.
Now,
when
you
have
taken
out
from
the
tree,
so,
all
supply
is
over,
now
it
is
on
its
own.
So,
to
acclimatize
with
the
new
circumstance,
the
fruit
materials
take
up
oxygen,
or
rate
of
respiration
goes
down,
and
when
it
gets
acclimatized,
it
starts
again
taking
up
and
at
the
end,
at
the
rise,
where
ripening
is
maximum,
this
period
is
known
as
ripening
period
right.
When,
it
becomes
maximum,
right,
that
is,
the
maximum
ripening,
after
that,
it
starts
deteriorating,
or
decaying,
right.
So,
this
is
what.
Now,
in
our
respiration,
or
in
our
shear
storage,
or
control
atmosphere
storage,
if
this
we
call,
R
and
if
this
we
call
T,
time,
right,
the
main
purpose
is
to
elongate
this
as
much
as
you
can,
right,
as
if,
you
have
a,
you
have
a
string
of
thread,
which
you
can
elongate,
like
this.
So,
that
is
what
actually
CA
will
do,
or
does,
right.
You
are
elongating
the
rate
of
respiration
to
the
extent
you
can,
right.
So,
that
is
the
basic
of
the
CA
storage.
Now,
you
are
talking
about,
why
fruit
ripens?
Right,
and
how
it
ripens?
So,
this
is
what
I
was
referring
to
that
mango,
which
you
have
harvested
from
the
tree,
and
it
is
green
in
color,
it
has
acid,
it
has
starch,
it
has
chlorophyll,
it
has
pectin,
as
hard
pectin,
large
organic
substances,
there.
So,
while
ripening,
that
process,
while
ripening
that
process,
let
us
go
back
to
this.
In
this
process,
that
is,
what
we
were
referring
to,
this,
during
this
process,
that,
all
this
green
part
is
gradually
converted
to
yellow
part.How?
that
is
what
we
were
showing
you,
how
it
is
getting
converted.
So,
the
acid,
starch,
chlorophyll,
because
of
which,
it
is
green,
then
pectin,
because
of
which,
it
is
hard,
if
you
buy
raw
mango,
you
will
get
it,
to
be
hard,
large
organic
compounds,
are
there,
sorry,
large
organic
compounds
are
also
there.
So,
what
it
is
doing?
There
are
lots
of
enzymes,
like
kinase,
like
amylase,
like
hydrolase,
like
pectinase,
like
hydrolases,
and
many
others
are
there.
So,
what
do
they
do?
They
convert
this
acid
to
neutral
condition,
they
convert
starch
to
sugar,
they
convert
chlorophyll
to
anthocyanin,
which
is
yellow
in
color,
and
also
the
pectin,
hard,
is
converted
to
less
pectin
with
soft
pectin
type,
in
pectic
substances
you
will
see
this.
I
have
taught
in
detail
in
my
another
class,
which
is
also
in
NPTEL,
you
just
find
out,
which
is
also
available
in
LPTEL.
So,
they
are
less
pectin,
which
are
soft,
and
what
I
was
referring
to
that,
pectic
substances,
there
are
many
types,
protopectin,
pectin,
then
pectinic
acid
and
many
others.
So,
some
of
which
are
hard
in
nature,
some
of
which
are
soft
in
nature.
You
take
everyday
bread,
butter,
jam,
jelly,
right
in
that
jam,
jelly,
pectin
is
there,
right,
pectin
is
there
for
binding,
it
is
one
of
the
constituents,
right.
So,
that
is
converted
into
less
pectin
or
soft
pectin,
and
the
large
organics,
which
are
present
there,
they
are
converted
into
aromatic
substances,
and
that
is
why,
if
you
buy
mango,
and
ripen
it,
if
it
is
even
at
one
corner
of
the
room,
from
the
other
corner
of
the
room,
you
will
find
that,
yes,
in
this
room
mango
has
come,
ripen
mango,
right.
So,
that
is
what,
it
is
converted
into,
sorry,
into
different
aromatic
substances.
So,
we
can
say
that,
sometimes,
say,
wound
will
cause
rapid
ethylene
production
also.
This
means,
picking
a
fruit
will
sometimes
signal.
So,
you
are
picking
one
fruit
from
the
tree.
So,
it
gives
a
signal
to
ripen
and
infection
of
bacteria
or
fungi
rather
on
the
fruit,
can
also
do
the
same
job,
and
this
ethylene
signal
causes
development,
developmental
changes
that
result
in
fruit
ripening.
So,
what
happens
during
ripening?
New
enzymes
are
made,
because
of
the
ethylene
signal,
and
if
you
ask
your
parents,
or
those
who
go
to
the
market,
they
know
that,
unripened
fruits,
they
keep
in
with
carbide,
that
is
why,
most
of
the
time,
you
hear
this,
that
it
is
ripened
with
carbide,
right.
There
acetylene,
that
is
C
2
H
2
,
acetylene,
that
is
CH
triple
bond
CH,
this
is
acetylene.
So,
when
water
and
acetylene
they
are
together,
then
ethylene,
that
is,
C
2
H
4
,
that
is,
C
2
H
4
is
produced,
right,
and
that
is
what?
CH
2
double
bond
CH
2
,
right.
So,
this
is
carbon
and
this
is
double
bond
ok.
So,
acetylene
or
carbide
formation
or
carbide
ripening
are
also
done,
and
that
is
because
of
the
production
of
acetylene,
sorry,
ethylene.
So,
new
enzymes
are
made,
because
of
the
ethylene
signal,
and
these
include
hydrolases
to
help
break
down
chemicals
inside
the
fruits,
right,
and
amylases,
to
accelerate
rather,
amylases,
to
accelerate
hydrolysis
of
starch
into
sugar,
pectinase,
to
catalyze
pectinase,
to
catalyze
degradation
of
pectin,
andso
on.
Ethylene
apparently
turns
on
the
genes
that
are
then
transcribed
and
translated
to
make
these
enzymes.
The
enzymes
then,
catalyze
reactions
to
alter
the
characteristics
of
fruit.
The
action
of
the
enzymes,
cause
the
ripening
responses.
Chlorophyll
is
broken
down
and
sometimes,
new
pigments,
new
pigments
are
made,
so
that
the
fruit
skin
changes
color
from
green
to
red
or
yellow.
Acids
are
broken
down,
so
that,
the
fruit
changes
from
sour
to
neutral.
The
degradation
of
starch
by
amylase,
produces
sugar,
and
this
reduces
the
mealy,
that
is,
flowery
quality,
and
increases
juiciness.
The
breakdown
of
pectin
by
pectinase
between
the
fruit
cells
unglues
them,
so,
they
can
slip,
past
each
other,
that
results
in
a
softer
fruit.
Also
enzymes
break
down
large
organic
molecules
into
smaller
ones,
that
can
be
volatile,
that
is,
that
can
evaporate
into
the
air,
and
we
can
detect
as
an
aroma,
which
I
just
said,
gave
the
example
of
ripened
mango,
keeping
at
one
corner,
and
other
corner,
you
are
getting
it.
Now,
the
question
comes,
how
ethylene
is
formed,
right,
how
ethylene
is
formed?
So,
S
adenosyl
methionine,
is
a
precursor
for
the
synthesis
of
ethylene.
The
positive
charge
of
the
sulphur
atom
in
S
adenosyl
methionine,
that
methionine,
rather,
that
enables
the
cleavage
to
form
cyclopropane.
In
a
reaction
catalyzed
by
amino
cyclopropane
carboxylate
synthase
or
called
ACC
synthase,
that
subsequently ,
it
is
oxidized,
or
it
can
be
oxidized,
catalyze
the
oxidation
of
the
cyclopropane
to
ethylene,
that
takes
place.
Carbon
dioxide
carbon
dioxide,
some
prusik
acid,
immediately
detoxified
by
converting
to
beta,
converting
to
beta
cyanoanine,
and
water,
right.
So,
we
are
skipping
this
mechanism,
because
that,
we
have
already
given,
you
can
see
from
here
right.
Now,
which
one
is
first
temperature,
or
atmosphere.
In
control
atmosphere
storage,
which
we
have
not
defined
as
of
now.
So,
let
us
define
that,
what
is
that?
It
is
a
system,
in
which
the
recommended
production
of
oxygen
and
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
of
storage
atmosphere
are
established,
monitored,
and
maintained
throughout
the
storage
period
by
employing
the
external
means,
besides
reducing
the
temperature.
In
shear
storage,
the
rate
of
respiration
is
reduced
approximately ,
250
percent,
compared
to
normal
atmosphere
storage,
at
the
same
temperature.
Thus,
doubling
the
shelf
life
of
the
stored
produce.
So,
in
this
respect,
respiration
is
considered
to
be
the
major
metabolic
process
to
be
reduced
in
the
CA
storage,
right.
Now,
if
we
go
back
to
what
we
were
saying
that,
which
one
is
first,
that
means,
we
are
seeing
that
controlling
temperature
and
gas
composition,
these
two
together
is
giving
us
the
CA
storage.
Now,
which
one
is
first,
temperature
or
atmosphere,
right.
Say,
in
this
kind
of
a
big
room,
where
it
is
a
storage
one,
to
change
the
temperature,
it
will
take
lot
of
time,
with
the
help
of
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
right.
Obviously,
if
you
do
it
as
we
have
seen
in
the
freezing,
with
cryogenic
fluids,
then
it
could
be
doneinstantly,
but,
since
it
is
not,
and
it
is
only
by
the
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
then
the
time
requirement
will
be
very
high,
right.
So,
in
that
case
the
gas
composition
should
be
controlled
first,
so
that
the
changes
are
limited,
but
it
is
better
if
you
can
do
the
temperature
first,
because
we
have
seen
Q
10
,
earlier,
right.
If
we
have
seen
Q
10
,
earlier,
so,
if
we
do
that,
then
perhaps,
we
can
easily
control
the
system
ok.
Then,
how
to
do
this?
How
to
do
this,
right?
Right,
how
to
do
this?
To
do
this,
we
can
do
flushing
with
liquid
nitrogen,
which
we
have
done
in
our
department,
some
students
have
done
PhDs
also.
Then
you
can
control
both
temperature
and
gas
composition,
more
or
less
simultaneously ,
and
also
the
oxygen
concentration,
or
air,
whatever
it
be,
right.
Obviously,
why
we
are
using
liquid
nitrogen?
We
say,
which,
there
is
a
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
but
liquid
nitrogen,
we
are
using
obviously,
to
get
the
temperature
rapidly
changed,
and
to
control
the
composition
of
gas,
composition
of
gas,
that
is,
also
rapidly.
Now,
this
is
one
which,
we
have
done
obviously,
this
is
also
we
have
done,
and
this
has
been,
has
already
been,
I
mean
protected,
right.
So,
this
is
a
chamber,
and
since
liquid
nitrogen
does
not
come
in
contact
with
the
fruits
directly,
so,
some
steps
have
been
taken,
and
ultimately,
and
ultimately
totally
automatic
system
has
been
developed,
that
is
the
control
of
oxygen
concentration,
carbon
dioxide
concentration
and
temperature,
these
three
are
automatically
done
right.
Oxygen
is
allowed
to
vary
between
2
to
5
percent,
and
similarly
carbon
dioxide
is
also
varied
between
2
to
5
percent.
See,
when
oxygen
has
become
5
percent,
there
will
be
some
gas
which
will
be,
which
will
be
PURGED
out
and
if
carbon
dioxide
also
becomes
5
percent,
then
there
will
be
some
scrubber,
by
which
carbon
dioxide
is
also
brought
back.
Temperature,
generally
is
now
very
limited,
skipping
some
this
is
the
product,
which
we
have
done,
or
you
can
also
do,
that
is
lychee
which
we
have
done
for
2
months
or
even
more.
Then
this
is
how
the
place
where
you
are
keeping,
that
place
has
to
be
tested
against
pressure
drop
or
leakage,
right.
according
to
the
available
ASTM
method
we
have
checked
the
pressure
drop
right,
we
skip
this.
This
is
how
the
respiration
rate
that
we
have,
we
have
determined
right.
So,
there
is
a
sensor,
this
is
oxygen,
carbon
dioxide,
nitrogen,
analyzer,
or
meter.
So,
we
have
plotted
this
time
temperature,
sorry,
we
have
plotted
this
time
temperature
changes
and
there
we
have
seen
that
it
is
taking
very
long
time,
oxygen
uptake
or
down,
right,
it
is
taking
very
long
time
to
reach
from
20
percent
to
say
2
percent
or
5
percent,
right.
So,
in
this
way,
the
oxygen
uptake
or
respiration
rate
is
found
out,
right,
and
we
have
plotted
how
the
oxygen
is
depleting
and
temperature
also
is
increasing.
Then,
the
method
or
respiration
rate,
this
is
how
we
have
already
shown,
this
is
how
itis.
It
is,
there
is
a,
this
is
called
respirometer ,
right.
So,
all
are
tightly
sealed,
so
that
no
gas
can
get
in
or
can
come
out,
leak
test
we
have
done,
right,
and
this
is
a
DANS
sensor
method
of
your
monitoring
the
gas
composition,
ok.
So,
this
is
called
closed
system
method.
These
are
the
equations
by
which
R
O2
respiration
rate
in
terms
of
oxygen
consumption
or
in
terms
of
carbon
dioxide
release
are
determined,
and
then,
how
we
are
changing,
this
is
a
schematic
diagram
for
the
closed
system
method
right.
Respiration
rate
again
respiration
rate
is
also
following
Michaelis-Menten
type
of
equation.
So,
that
is
how
we
have
done
right,
and
this
is
called
enzyme
kinetics
principles
of
enzyme
kinetics,
which
we
have
used
right.
So,
there
could
be
uncompetitive,
competitive,
right,
non
competitive
type
of
relations,
right,
once
you
have
then,
you
get
the
respiration
rate,
from
there
you
can
know
how
much
time
you
can
extend
through
controlled
atmosphere
storage?
