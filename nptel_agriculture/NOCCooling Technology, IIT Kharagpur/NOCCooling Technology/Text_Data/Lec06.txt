Cooling Load Calculation
Good
afternoon.
Hopefully ,
you
remember
that
in
the
previous
week,
we
have
completed
why
we
need
cooling.
What
is
the
need
of
cooling?
Why
you
should,
other
than
cooling,
whether
it
can
be
done
or
not?
This,
we
have
discussed
in
detail
right.
Now ,
the
question
comes
if
cooling
is
required,
then
how
much,
that
is
a
first
question,
how
much
cooling
is
required?
Like
in
this
room,
where
I
am
giving
this
lecture,
there
is
a
cooling.
This
cooling
is
not
for
human
or
the
comfort
of
the
teachers,
who
are
taking
classes.
This
cooling
is
primarily
for
the
instruments
and
equipment,
which
are
used
for
this
lecture,
but it is also a cooling load, right.
Like,
you
cannot
see
that,
this
is
a
4
wall
so
and
obviously ,
it
is
also
soundproof,
but
to
make
it,
and
of
course,
there
is
door,
the
other
day
we
have
also
shown
you
door,
today
also
we
will
show .
So,
all
these
are
factors
that
how
much
cooling
is
required.
The
other
day,
I
told
you
or
if
by
chance
I
have
missed
it,
then
let
me
also
tell,
if
you
remember ,
and
if
we,
if
you
are
acquainted
with
the
present
day
activities,
then
you
might
have
seen
couple
of
months
or
year
back
government
of
India
requested
all
the
manufacturers
of
household
air
conditioners,
and
also
commercial
air
conditioners,
to
operate
not
below
24
degree
centigrade.
Generally ,
you
will
see
any
air
conditioner
if
you
put
on,
as
on
today ,
that it can go up  to 18 or 16 degree centigrade, that is too cold.
In
our
country
18
or
16
degree
centigrade
is
too
cold.
In
developed
countries,
in
many
places,
they
may
have
this
18,
16
degree
normal
because
it
goes
down
to
0
or
sub
0,
at
this
very
moment,
my
son
is
at
Philadelphia.
So,
I
come
to
know
that
their
normal
temperature
has
now
come
down
to
8
or
7
and
which
is
within
a,
perhaps
couple
of
weeks,
it
will
go
to
sub
0,
to
minus
15,
20
or
even
lower .
So,
for
them
this
16,
18
is
not
a
problem,
but
for
us
definitely
16
or
18,
is
too
cold,
and
as
you
lower
down
your
temperature,
desired
expected
temperature,
the
more
will
be
the
cooling
down,
means
more
compressor
has
to
run,
not
only
compressor ,
compressor ,
condenser
everybody .
So,
more
energy
is
required,
the
moment
more
energy
is
required,
that
will
be,
that
will
have
to
be
provided
by
the
provider
rather
in
this
case,
we
can
say
the
government
ofIndia or the state government who so ever .
So,
that
is
why,
perhaps
there
was
a
circular
that
please
keep
your
air
conditioners
not
more
than
or
rather
not
less
than
24
degree
centigrade
because,
between
24
to
26
this
is
one
of
the
comfortable
zone.
This
is
more
or
less
comfortable
zone
throughout
India.
So,
that
was
perhaps,
it
did
not
come
just
like
that,
there
are
many
experts
to
look
into
this
and
then
only
any
government,
they
decide
on
whatever
process
or
procedure
to
be
followed.
So,
we
need
to
know
the
cooling
load.
So,
today's
class,
that
is
why
we
are
dedicating to the cooling load, right.
So,
if
it
is
cooling
load,
then
as
you
can
see
that
refrigeration
or
cooling
load
calculation.
In
this
slide
and
we
are
saying
obviously ,
cooling
load
means
how
much
refrigeration
you
have
to
provide,
in
other
word
that
is
the
cooling
load.
So,
refrigeration
load,
as
we
have
seen
that,
it
is
divided
into
two
parts
one
is
unsteady
state
load
and
another
is
steady
state
load.
The
moment
I
say
unsteady
state
load
and
steady
state
load,
you
will
say
we
have
not
understood
what
you
said?
Then
let
me
explain
that
steady
load
is,
which
is
time
independent,
anything
steady
in
terms
of
engineering
or
science
is
time
independent
and
anything
unsteady
is
time
dependent,
right.
So,
with
time, it may change, but the steady load does not change.
In
that
steady
load,
we
can
divide
them
into,
like
sensible
heat,
heat
of
respiration,
if
it
is
a
fresh
produce,
heat
of
fusion
of
water
in
the
product,
heat
of
fusion
or
heat
of,
sorry ,
solidification
whatever
you
call,
they
constitute
the
part
of
the
load.
I
should
not
say
it
is
fully
steady
or
fully
unsteady ,
this
is
the
part
of
load,
right,
because
as
you
see
sensible
heat
means
your
room
temperature
was
say
40
degree
centigrade
and
you
want
to
bring
down
to
24
degree
or
20
degree
centigrade.
So,
there
is
no
phase
change,
right.
So,
this
lowering
of
temperature
from
40
to
24
degree
centigrade
or
20
degree
centigrade
is
the
sensible
heat
because
there
is
no
phase
change,
as
we
are
respiring
we
are
living,
means
respiring,
anything
living
means
respiring.
So,
the
produce,
which
you
will
be
keeping,
if
it
is
also
respiring,
then
it
will
have
a
load
and
I
will
come
afterwards
in
respiration
and
it is also a unsteady .
Then
heat
of
fusion
of
water
in
the
product,
if
it
is,
we
are
not
talking
about
air
condition
only,
we
are
talking
about
the
refrigeration
load
right.
So,
if
your
product
is
needed
to
be
kept
at
minus
2
degree
centigrade,
definitely
there
may
be
a
situation
where
phase
change
may
come
up.
So,
there,
that
heat
of
fusion
or
heat
of
crystallization
or
heat
of
solidification
this
part
of
water
in
the
product
will
come
up,
right
and
again
I
am
not
saying
it
to
be
a
completely
unsteady
or
steady ,
because
if
you,
if
you
put
them
into
that
bracket,
they
will
never
come
to
steady ,
or
never
come
to
unsteady .
Because,
sensible
heat,
while
bringing
down
from
40
to
20,
or
even
low,
if
you
bring
down
to
40
to
10,
oreven
lower ,
during
that
transition
of
40
to
20
or
10,
is
the
unsteady .
But,
once
it
reaches,
then
also
it
is
a
sensible
heat
which
is
required
to
be
taken
out
to
maintain
the
temperature, because it is m C p delta T.
So,
that
is
under
steady .
So,
that
is
why,
but,
we
can
say
that
in
the
beginning,
these
are
all
unsteady ,
right,
but
that
fusion
of
water
or
solidification
of
water ,
so,
that
is
perhaps,
steady
one
because
though
it
is
a
function
of
temperature,
but
still
once
it
is
reaching
that
point
then
it
is
a
steady
one.
Other
things
are
like
heat
in
leak
through
the
walls
of
the
enclosure
right.
The
house
where
you
are
at
the
very
moment
if
you
have
in
your
room
air
condition
then
in
that
room
walls
are
there,
windows
are
there,
doors
are
there.
So,
from
if
they
are
closed
even
then
there
will
be
because
your
room
inside
maybe
say
as
we said 20, 24 outside maybe 35, 40 or whatever temperature.
So,
this
delta
T
is
always
there
and
because
of
that
the
wall
it
has
a
conductivity
though
low
not
only
wall,
but
if
you
have
insulation
in
many
houses
or
many
places
they
provide
insulation
to
minimize
the
load.
Whatever
be
if
it
is
a
wall
or
if
it
is
a
composite
like
wall
then
insulation
then
concrete
everything
they
will
have
one
resultant
conductivity
right.
So,
there
you
can
find
out
from
U
A
delta
T,
U
is
the
outside
heat
transfer
coefficient,
overall,
A,
you
know ,
delta
T
you
know ,
because
outside
temperature
is
known
inside
temperature
is
known.
So,
you
can
find
out.
So,
heat
in
leak
through
the
wall,
this
is
a
steady one, right.
Why
I
am
saying
steady?
You
may
say,
sir,
we
have
started
from
40
and
you
are
saying
it
to
be
steady .
40
to
20,
it
is
taking
time,
it
cannot
be
just
like
that,
yes,
can
be
also
made
just
like
that
through
different
ways
of
cooling
that
is
different,
but
otherwise
it
will
take
time.
So,
during
that
period
that
U
A
delta
T,
U,
which
you
are
saying,
outside
may
be
40
and
inside,
starting
from
40
to
20,
it
will
take
a
little
time.
So,
for
engineering
calculation
purpose,
we
assume
it
to
be
that
it
will
come
to
20
and
then
this
becomes
a
steady
load,
yeah,
during
the
transition
from
40
to
20,
it
is
unsteady
absolutely
right
and
you
will
see
that
in
many
houses
there
are
cracks
or
crevices.
So,
they
will
also
incorporate
some
part
of
the
load,
but
again
it
is
a
steady
because
that
cracks
and
crevices, they are already there, unless you repair , unless you do something,  it remains.
So,
it
is
under
steady
condition.
Different
heat
of
condensation
of
moisture
infiltrating
into
the
enclosure,
this
comes
of
course,
under
say,
storage
preparation.
So,
there,
it
may
have,
if
you
look
at
every
store
is
having
a
moisture
barrier ,
because
if
moisture
barrier
is
not
there
then
the
insulation
will
be
affected
by
the
moisture
and
insulation
property
will
be
more
or
less
lost
or
minimized.
So,
there
is
a
vapor
barrier ,
but
even
then
from
the
product,
from
outside,
some
quantity ,
of
moisture
will
come
and
they
will
be
more
or
less
coming
to
the
evaporator
right.
I
told
you
in
a
household
refrigerator
there
is
theevaporator coil down below .
So,
that
evaporator
coil
which
is
there,
if
you
start
today ,
fresh
the
coil,
you
can
see,
it
is
dry,
but
maybe
after
7
days
of
use,
you
see
the
coil,
there
is
some
ice
already
formed,
Right,
where
from
this
ice
came?
This
ice
came
from
the
products,
from
opening
and
closing
the
doors,
from
outside
air.
So,
all
these
put
some
moisture,
they
will
deposit
onto
the
evaporator
coil
right.
So,
that
is
to
condense
it
or
to
transform
it
from
vapor
to
solid
ice
there
will
be
some
latent
heat
of
condensation.
So,
that
will
be
a
steady
load.
Heat generated inside the room if there be any .
There
are
many
ways
of
generating
heat
like
in
this
room
you
see
the
light
you
cannot
see
the
light,
but
these
lights
are
on
and
they
are
having
lot
of
wattage
some
are
100
some
are
150
or
200
so
much
wattage.
So
these
are
all
adding.
So,
if
you
have
10
such
bulbs
then
10
into
say,
on
an
average,
100.
So
1000
watt
you
are
constantly
offering
to
the
cooling
load,
right.
So,
what
we
need?
We
need
to
calculate,
we
have
already
talked
about the types of loads we have said it to  be either steady or unsteady .
Unsteady
in
the
beginning
and
after
sometime
when
it
comes
to
steady
then
all
becomes
steady ,
right.
I
was
talking
about
respiration.
The
product
respire
like
we
respire,
we
are
also
living,
and
I
am
not
going
to
that
how
respiration
cycle
is
working
because
that
is
beyond
the
purview
of
the
course,
but
since
you
as
I
told
that
as
and
when
I
see
that
new
thing
is
coming
I
just
cannot
remain
silent
because
it
is
you
who
is
getting
information
you
are
learning.
So,
how
does
it
matter
if
I
tell
you
if
it
is
beyond
the
course
if
it
is
beyond
requirement
how
does
it
matter?
If
you
know
it
is
always
good
because
knowledge
is
all
the
time
the
best
wealth,
the
best
wealth
is
the
knowledge.
So,
what
I
was
saying
that
heat
of
respiration
that
we
are
respiring
suppose
in
this
room
all
the
students are there.
So,
all
the
students
are
respiring
each
of
them,
you,
me,
everybody .
If
instead
of
ourselves
if
there
are
the
product
or
produce
then
also
that
is
respiring.
The
best
example
is
potato
because
potato
is
kept
almost
8
to
10
months
in
the
cold
room
right.
So,
it
is
respiring
at
that
and
this
respiration
is
also
a
function
of
temperature.
I
do
not
know
how
many
of
you
have
gone
to
high
altitudes,
high
altitude,
I
mean
say
Kashmir
or
say
Ladakh,
kind
of
Darjeeling,
these
are
generally
considered
to
be
high
altitude
because
there
the
temperatures
are
also
very
low
maybe
somewhere
5
to
8
degree
or
even
lower
somewhere  it could be less than 0 depending on the time.
Now
if
you
are
going,
if
you
are
going
from
sea
level,
where
temperature
is
very
high
compared
to
this
high
altitude
you
will
see
your
respiration
rate
has
gone
down.
Another
best
example
it
can
be
that
I
hope
all
of
you
do
play
whatever
you
may
play
football,cricket,
badminton
or
any
other
anything.
So,
there
you
are
running
badminton
or
table
tennis
except
Carom
and
of
thing
where
physical
movements
are
not
so
required,
basket
everywhere
you
are
running
around
and
lot
of
sweating
you
are
having
and
if
you
just
remember
during
that
period
your
respiration
was
very
high
or
if
somebody
is
running
say
100
meter
or
1
kilometer
whatever
be
then
this
sweating
is
also
increased
as
well
your
rate
of
respiration
also
is
increased.
That
means,
rate
of
respiration
is
a
function
of
temperature
also,
right.
So,
the
one
which
we
have
kept
in
the
cooling
system
at
the
beginning,
whatever
respiration
rate
was
there,
if
steady
state
is
arrived,
or
achieved,
according to your desired set  temperature, we said 20, 10, 0, minus 10 whatever be.
So,
the
respiration
rate
also
will
go
down.
It
is
a
function
of
temperature.
So,
it
will
also
come
to
steady
only
when
the
desired
temperature
is
achieved,
right
from
plus
40
to
minus
10
degree
suppose
then
it
will
take
some
hours
of
time
or
days
of
time
depending
on
the
size.
So,
depending
on
the
size
of
the
entire
thing
it
will
take
couple
of
hours
to
couple
of
days
to
weeks
because
it
is
a
volume
also
which
is
important.
So,
once
it
comes
to
the
desired
set
temperature
then
it
will
also
respire
at
the
constant
rate
of
according to that temperature, right that is why I gave the example of running.
For
example,
another
one,
suppose
a
mad
dog
is
after
somebody ,
I
do
not
say
you
after
somebody ,
then
what
he
or
she
will
do
he
or
she
will
start
running
like
again
a
mad,
because
of
afraid
of
getting
bite
from
the
dog
and
that
time
if
you
just
calculate
or
see
the
rate
of
respiration
of
that
person
is
one
of
the
highest
because
that
time
he
has
to
avoid
the
dog
for
which
running
like
anything
was
required,
right.
So,
it
is
a
function
of
temperature
and
respiration
becomes
steady
once
it
attains
the
desired
set
temperature
ok.
So,
with
this
we
conclude
today's
class
next
class
we
will
start
looking
into
how
the
loads are calculated.  Thank you.
