Basics of Thermodynamics
Good
evening.
We
have
finished
in
the
previous
class
cooling
load.
All
types
of
cooling
loads
we
have
discussed
as
far
as
possible
in
detail
and
also
we
have
covered
some
of
the
supporting
things
like
how
to
find
out
the
equivalent
thermal
conductivity
etc,
these
things
we
have
done.
Now ,
we
will
move
to
another
very
important
one,
before
we
go
to
the
generation
of
cooling
or
production
of
cooling,
that
is
the
thermodynamics.
Some
basics
of
thermodynamics,
if
we
are
not
able
to
know ,
we
shall
not
be
able
to
follow
the
further
proceedings.
So,
we
need
to
know
the
thermodynamics
and
that
is
the
basics
of
thermodynamics.
So,
if
we
look
at
the
basic
definition
of
thermodynamics,
we
can
say
that
thermodynamics
is
a
physical
science
that
studies
the
effects
on
material
bodies
and
radiation
in
regions
of
space
of
transfer
of
heat
and
of
work
done
on
or
by
the
bodies
or
radiation.
It
interrelates
macroscopic
variables
such
as
temperature,
volume,
and
pressure,
which
describe
physical
properties
of
material
bodies,
of
course,
and
radiation,
which
in
this
thermodynamical
science,
are
called
thermodynamic
systems.
So,
basically
the
macroscopic
variables
like
temperature,
volume,
pressure
and
afterwards,
we
will
see,
some
more
property
values
are
coming
up
like
entropy ,
like
internal
energy,
which
we
have
already
said
etc.
Of
course,
out
of
these
temperature,
pressure,
volume,
we
know ,
but
entropy
we
do
not
know ,
but
we
will
come
why
and
how
entropy
is
coming, where from.
At
least,
that
is
why
some
basic
knowledge
on
thermodynamics
is
absolutely
required.
Now
the
fundamental
of
thermodynamic
properties
are
such
that
we
know
fluid
flow,
hopefully ,
fluid
flow,
as
of
now,
I
have
not
covered
a
little,
but
I
will
try
again
as
I
told
you.
Now
the
new
thing
which
comes
up,
I
try
to
give
some,
weightage
on
that.
So
that
it
becomes
overall
complete,
not
specifically
complete,
ok.
So,
from
the
fluid
flow,
transfer of heat, work are at the backbone of refrigeration and air conditioning.
A
thermodynamic
property
is
an
observable
property
or
measurable
or
calculable
andattribute
of
the
system
in
the
state
of
thermodynamic
equilibrium.
Now
obviously ,
equilibrium
another
new
word,
which
has
come
up,
let
me
tell,
if
a
little
possible,
that
say,
you
are
moving
from
here
to
there
right,
and
I
am
moving
from
there
to
here,
right,
and
if
there
is
one
observer
here,
who
looks
both
of
us.
Now
if
your
going
from
here
to
there,
and
my
coming
from
there
to
here,
are
at
the
same
rate,
that
means,
this
person
will
always
look
both
of
us
at
all
the
places
because
our
rates
are
same
right
or
if
it
is
not
shown
in
the
reverse
way,
if
it
is
shown
on
the
forward
way,
then
it
becomes
more
visible
right.
If
it
is
shown
both
in
the
same
way
then
it
is
visible.
So
then
it
can
be
said
that we are at equilibrium.
So
this
person
can
see
us
all
the
time
at
different
places.
So
we
are
at
equilibrium
in
terms
of
our
movement.
Another
example
I
can
set,
that
will
be
more
clear .
Suppose
you
have
one
unit
which
is
like
one
H,
this
is
one
H
type
right,
and
there
is
a
valve
and
this
is
a
gas
say
A
and
this
is
a
gas
say
B
right.
Now ,
if
we
open
this
valve
then
what
will
happen?
A
will
move
to
that,
because
here
A
concentration
is
very
high,
here
low,
because
of
the
concentration
gradient
A
will
move
to
this
place
and
similarly
B
will
move
to
this
place
due
to
the
same
reason,
that
concentration
of
B
is
here
very
high
compared to that.
After
sometime,
there
will
be
no
movement
of
A
or
B
because,
concentration
of
A
and
concentration
of
A
in
this
are
same.
The
same
is
true
with
concentration
of
B
of
this
and
this.
So,
if
we
even
close,
we
will
see
that
concentration
here
concentration
here
is
same,
no
further
movement.
If
there
be
any
movement
then
the
same
quantity
of
A
will
move
from
here
to
there
and
the
same
quantity
of
A
will
move
from
there
to
here
right.
This
means
that,
both
A
and
B
are
in
equilibrium,
both
A
and
B
are
in
equilibrium
this
is
the
concept
of
equilibrium
and
that
concept
will
be
very
much
required
and
will
be
dealing
with the entire thing right.
So
a
thermodynamic
property
is
an
observable
measurable
or
calculable
attribute
of
the
system
in
the
state
of
thermodynamic
equilibrium.
Another
example
I
can
set
up
for
equilibrium,
sorry ,
is
that
in
this
room
if
this
is
a
room
and
say
if
there
is
a
heater
here
right
and
this
heater
you
have
put
on
for
say
5
minute,
then
what
will
happen?
This
temperature
T
1
will
be
much
higher
than
T
2
right
and
T
2
is
the
temperature
here.
So,
what
will
happen
if
this
is
a
gas
normally
here
this
will
move
from
there
to
here
this
will
move
from
here
to
there.
This
movement
will
go
on
and
this
is
again
in
the
earlier
case
we
had
said
that,
this
is
unsteady
state
right.
So
this
unsteady
state
will
remain
till
this
T
1 and this T 2 becomes one temperature say  T 3 and that T 3 will be all around.
So
we
can
say
that
air
at
this
place,
air
at
this
place,
they
have
become
under
equilibrium
condition.
This
is
how
equilibrium
can
be
demonstrated
or
can
beexplained.
So
any
measurable
or
calculable
quantity
which
are
in
equilibrium
is
under
thermodynamic
equilibrium.
So
thermodynamic
equilibrium
details,
or
rather ,
it
deals
with
mechanical,
thermal
and
chemical
equilibrium.
This
signifies
that
the
absence
of
unbalanced
forces,
the
absence
of
heat
and
mass
transfer
and
the
absence
of
chemical
reactions prevail in the system at the thermodynamic equilibrium.
So
when
there
is
a
thermodynamic
equilibrium
there
is
no
unbalanced
forces,
there
is
no
mass
transfer ,
there
is
no
heat
transfer
and
there
is
no
chemical
reactions.
So
then
we
call
it
to
be
thermodynamic
equilibrium
right.
So
we
can
say
thermodynamics
deal
with
the
change
in
system
from
one
state
of
equilibrium
to
another
state
of
equilibrium.
So
it
is
that
thermodynamics
which
deals
with
the
change
in
the
system
from
one
state
of
equilibrium
to
another
state
of
equilibrium
right
that
is
what
is
thermodynamic
equilibrium.
Now
as
I
said
fluid
flow,
which
we
have
not
touched
upon,
we
have
done
a
little,
maybe
heat
transfer ,
a
little
maybe,
yeah,
heat
transfer ,
and
now
let
us
look
into
a
little pipe flow  or fluid flow .
Now ,
this
is
a
sectional
view
of
a
pipe
through
which
a
liquid
is
flowing.
So,
in
this
one
thing
is
required,
that
is
there
is
no
end
effect.
The
basic
is
that
there
is
no
end
effect
and
the
flow
is
steady ,
a
fluid
is
flowing
now
that
fluid
can
be
gas
or
liquid
anything
by
the
definition
of
fluid
we
know
that
it
is
either
a
gas
or
liquid.
So
we
assume
it
to
be
a
liquid
like
water ,
so
what
I
said
is
that
there
is
no
end
effect
what
do
we
mean
by
that?
Let
us
look
at
here,
suppose
you
have
a
tap
and
from
that
tap
water
is
dropping,
there
is
a
source
of
water
right,
and
now
if
the
source
is
far
away ,
say
from
here
and
if
it
comes
to
this,
then
when
you
open
the
valve
here,
first
there
will
be
some
gas
which
is
coming
or
air,
whatever ,
it
is
coming.
I
hope
you
have
come
across
at
your
home
that
when
there
is
no
water
in
the
tap
and
when
first
water
was
coming
then
there
was
more
than
water
some
gases
or
air
is
coming
out
with
a
sound
of
whatever
it
be
right
and
after
sometime
there is a continuous flow of water  that we have seen, we have experienced also.
So
this
is
called
end
effect,
this
is
happening
at
the
beginning
of
the
flow
and
also
happening
at
the
end
of
the
flow
when
the
source
is
becoming
empty ,
the
same
thing
also
happens.
So,
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end,
that
is
why
it
is
called
end
effect.
So
there
is
no
end
effect,
the
flow
is
fully
developed
and
steady
this
is
the
basic
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
right.
We
have
taken
a
section
of
the
pipe
like
this
we
have
taken
a
section
of
the
pipe,
this
section
is
vertical
section
and
the
thickness
of
the
pipe,
some
it
is
there,
we
have
taken
a
volume
element
in
the
pipe
this
volume
element
is
having
delta
r
as
the
radius or thickness  and delta x as the other dimension. These are the two dimensions.
So
third
dimension
we
can
assume
it
to
be
unit
right,
the
third
dimension
we
can
assume
it
to
be
unit.
So
what
we
are
doing,
we
are
applying
some
pressure
at
here,
that
is
P
at
x,right.
So
we
are
applying
some
pressure
that
is
P
at
x
and
also
we
are
applying,
this
flow
is
flowing
from
left
to
right
this
is
the
radial
direction,
this
is
the
flow
direction,
one
is
r
another
is
x,
we
call
it
to
be
a
shell
momentum
balance.
So
if
we
do
shell
momentum
because
it
is
like
a
shell.
So
if
we
do
the
shell
momentum
balance
so
here
P
at
x
and
here
P at x plus delta x right.
So
we
can
say,
one
minute,
let
me
erase
it
off.
We
can
say
that
during
the
shell
momentum
balance
inside
a
pipe
which
is
valid
for
a
fluid
which
is
incompressible.
I
hope
you
know
incompressible
fluid.
Incompressible
means
density
of
which
does
not
change
with
pressure,
for
a
reasonable
pressure
drop
or
pressure
difference,
there
is
no
density
change
for
incompressible
fluid.
If
it
is
compressible,
then
with
the
change
of
pressure the density will change.
So,
the
fluid
is
incompressible,
there
it
is
a
Newtonian
fluid,
flow
is
fully
developed
and
it
is
one
dimensional,
that
too,
steady
laminar
flow
and
there
is
no
end
effect
and
velocity
profile
does
not
vary
along
the
x
direction.
That
means,
the
velocity
profile
whatever
be
the
velocity ,
that
velocity
profile
does
not
change
along
the
x
direction.
So,
whatever
is,
here
is,
here
is,
here
same.
That
velocity
profile
is
not
changing
with
the
direction
of
the
flow.
These
are
some
initial
conditions
for
the
development
of
flow
through the pipe, this  is called pipe flow .
Then
we
can
say
the
governing
equation
will
be
the
rate
of
momentum
in
minus
rate
of
momentum
out
plus
some
of
the
forces
acting
on
this
should
be
equal
to
rate
of
accumulation
of
momentum.
I
repeat
rate
of
momentum
in
minus
rate
of
momentum
out
plus
some
of
the
forces
acting
on
it
should
be
equal
to
rate
of
accumulation
of
momentum.
Now ,
when
it
is
a
steady
flow,
if
you
again
go
back
to
the
previous
slide,
when
you
have
the
steady
flow
right.
So
whatever
fluid
is
coming
with
time
here,
the
same
fluid
is
going
out
at
the
same
time,
right.
So,
that
means,
this
and
that
has
no
change.
So
we
can
say
that
the
change
in
momentum
rather
momentum
in
by
convection
is
equal
to
momentum
out
by
convection
.
So,
momentum
in
by
convection
is
equal
to
momentum
out
by
convection
that
means,
ok.
One
more
thing
I
should
say
before
we
proceed
further .
How
the
momentum
will
be
transferred?
one
by
convection
that
is
called
bulk flow .  So this is how it is conveying, this is called bulk flow , BULK, bulk flow right.
So,
one
is
by
bulk
flow
that
is
the
entire
molecule,
entire
thing
is
moving,
this
is
bulk
flow
another
is
called
molecular
transport
right.
This
we
have
to
understand,
molecular
transport
means,
we
have
said,
it
to
be
laminar ,
that
means,
all
the
layers
in
the
pipe
they
are
like
this
and
the
fluid
is
flowing.
let
me
take
another
I
do
not
know
whether
it
will
bepossible
or
not,
color
it
is
not
coming
let
it
be.
So
what
is
happening?
This
liquid
here
it
is
progressing
like
this.
Now
when
it
is
progressing
like
this
the
molecules
inside,
you
know ,
as
of
now
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
are
available
that
you
know
I
assume
that
you know that kinetic theory that is  the molecules can move freely randomly right.
The
same
kinetic
theory ,
if
we
also
applied,
normally ,
nowadays,
is
that,
is
also
done
for
the
liquid,
also
because
it
is
not
developed,
so
we
apply
it
and
find
that
it
is
or
it
can
be.
So,
now
what
is
happening,
the
molecule
of
the
water ,
it
is
going
with
like
this,
as
a
zigzag,
in
the
same
plane,
but
a
zigzag
right.
If
we
expand
with
the
help
of
say
microscopes,
then
one
molecule
is
moving
like
this,
like
this,
like
this,
like
this,
like
this,
like
this,
the
thing
is
like
that
first
layer
is,
adjacent
layer
is
there
right.
So,
this
molecule
is
imparting
because
of
the
movement
of
molecule
to
its
adjacent
layer
by
the
molecular
movement
right
and
this
is
called
momentum
transfer
by
molecular
movement,
ok.
So,
if we understand this, then we can find out that, the force, which is applying on it  right.
So,
perhaps
today
our
time
is
over,
tomorrow ,
in
the
next
class,
we
will
start,
but
we
will
definitely
not
tell
whatever
we
have
told,
maybe
a
preamble
a
little,
but
we
assume
that
the
bulk
flow
and
the
molecular
transport
we
have
understood,
is
it
ok.
Thank
you
so
much.
