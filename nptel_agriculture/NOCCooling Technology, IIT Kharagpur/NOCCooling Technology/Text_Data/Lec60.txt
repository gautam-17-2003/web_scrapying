Good
morning,
my
dear
friends,
my
dear
boys
and
girls.
I
am
so
happy
that
we
have
come
to
the
last
class
end
of
the
class,
but
the
problem
is,
time
is
30
minutes,
and
I
have
to
complete
the
entire
thing
in
this
30
minute,
whatever
is
remaining.
So,
please
pardon
me
if
I
am
moving
fast
because,
I
have
no
choice,
lot
of
things
as
you
know ,
is
required
to
be
said
and
there
is
no
end,
right.
So,
obviously ,
selection,
we
have
made
in,
I
have
made
in
such
a
way
that
most
of
the,
most
of
the
required
things
are
told
and
you
are
equipped
with
all
information
necessary ,
right.
So,
it
is
the
ice
cream,
a
continuation
class
right.
So,
it
is
the
commercial
pasteurizer ,
right
commercial
pasteurizer ,
typically ,
right
and
this
is
also
another
type
of
pasteurizer ,
this
is
called
plate
heat
exchanger ,
as
it
is
appearing
from
here,
that
this
is
a
plate
type,
right
plate
heat
exchanger ,
with
all
control
and
other
things,
this
is
another
way
of
pasteurizing
right.
Then,
we
go
to
homogenizer ,
homogenizer
this
is
a
typical
APV ,
APV
is
a
multi,
this
is
I
mean
rather ,
what
we
call
international
company ,
right
and
it
has
also
perhaps,
some
Indian
outlet,
and
India
is
also
making
nowadays,
homogenizers.
However ,
this
is
a
homogenizer ,
it
is
having
two
stages,
one
stage
is
2500
psig
and
another
stage
is
500
psig,
two
stages,
I
have
no
choice
now ,
since
it
has
come,
why
two
stages
are
required?
Because,
in
the
first
stage,
say
the
sizes
are
30
micron,
right
and
in
this,
when
it
comes
out,
then
what
happened,
it
again
agglomerates,
you
have
made
it
to
2
micron,
right,
but
it
agglomerates
again,
it
size
goes
up
to
maybe
3,
5,
10
whatever
micron
it
is.
Then,
in
the
second
stage,
it
is
again,
it
is
again
shattered,
and
made
to
2
micron,
and
now ,
it
is
becoming
stabilized,
that
is
another
part
of
homogenization,
this
is
not
possible
to
do
it
here,
if
someday ,
I
am
allowed
to
talk
to
you
with
milk,
then
definitely ,
that
is,
of
course,
a
dairy
part,
I
am
not
sure
whether
it
will
be
allowed
or
not,
then
I
can
discuss
in
detail.
However ,
then
we
come
to
a
typical
ice
cream
freezer .
As
I
said,
that
is
inlet
is
4
degree
centigrade,
it
is
entering
into
the
ice
cream
freezer ,
and
it
is
coming
out
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade
at
the
outlet.
So,
here
it
is
at
minus
5,
here
it
is
at
4
degree
centigrade.
Now ,
I
should
also
explain
the
freezer ,
where
you
will
come
across
with
why
cooling
is
required?
This
is
supplied
with,
this
is
the
part
entirely
for
the
refrigeration,
right
this
is
entirely
refrigeration,
and
the
one
which
normally
used
is
ammonia,
because
of
its
high
COP ,
right
and
this
ammonia,
in
theliquid
form,
enters
into,
and
this
is
an
insulated
container .
Number
1,
first
one
is
a
barrel,
where
there
is
a
shaft,
and
in
that
shaft,
there
is
a
blade.
It
rotates
through
drive,
right
and
after ,
this
is
made
of
steel
stainless
steel,
of
course,
and
as
I
said
in
the
freezing
class,
that
the
inside
of
it
is
so
polished
that
the
size
of
the
ice
crystal
becomes
very
very
minute,
right.
Obviously ,
once
the
ice
crystals
are
formed,
then
this
is
called
scraper
blade,
or
shaft,
along
with
a
scraper
blade.
So,
when
it
is
rotating,
it
is
scraping
of f
this
already
adhered
fine
thin
layer ,
which
is
scraped
of f
and
mixes
with
inside
of
the
remaining
ice
cream
mix.
Now ,
after
this,
there
is
ammonia.
This
ammonia
is
in
the
liquid
form
and
it
gives
only
latent
heat,
right,
it
gives
only
latent
heat,
and
the
vapour
goes
back
to
the
compressor
again.
This
is
acting
as
the
evaporator ,
right,
this
is
acting
as
evaporator .
Then,
the
other
thing
is
that,
what
we
were
saying,
so
ammonia,
and
then
this
is
the
dasher ,
ok,
with
some
blades,
this
is
ammonia,
and
then
it
is
insulated,
highly
insulated,
right
highly
insulated.
So,
that
the
outside
is
ammonia,
this
cold
is
not
wasted
obviously ,
there
will
be
a
little,
you
cannot
stop
it,
whatever
insulation
material
you
give,
there
will
be
a
heat
loss,
or
heat
gain,
rather ,
from
the
outside,
again,
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
outside.
However ,
this
ice
cream,
which
has
been
first
like
that,
it
is
produced,
it
is
a
continuous
one,
so
it
is
entering
at
0th
time,
here,
at
4
degree
centigrade,
and
after
sometime,
because,
as
we
said
300
litre
per
hour ,
or
700
litre
per
hour .
That
means,
it
is
giving
you,
if
you
know
the
length
of
the
freezer ,
then
you
know
what
is
the
retention
time
from
the
output,
right.
So,
this
is
coming
here
maybe
in
5
seconds
or
10
seconds,
it
will
go
to
this
side,
where
it
will
be
exiting
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
right
and
it
is
a
semi
solid,
right
it
is
because,
it
is
flowing,
otherwise
it
cannot
come
out,
if
it
is
frozen
inside,
right,
assume
it
is
to
be
minus
10
degree
centigrade,
then
what
will
happen?
this
will
not
be
moving
out.
So,
to
have
the
movement
of
the
frozen
ice
cream,
it
is
not
brought
down
below
minus
5
degree
centigrade,
its
initial
freezing
point,
I
had
said
earlier
also
minus
2.5
degree
centigrade.
So,
from
minus
2.5
to
minus
5,
it
is
brought
down
and
then
it
is,
it
is
packed
in
dif ferent
containers
depending
on
the
pack,
as
you
know ,
you
nowadays,
you
have
in
the
market,
100
ml,
50
ml,
25
ml,
all
these,
there
are
1
litre
pack,
there
are
4
litre
packs,
and
many
other
sizes.
So,
accordingly
it
is
done.
So,
the
basic
thing
is
that
you
are
entering
your
liquid
mix
at
4
degree
and
it
being
a
continuous
one,
it
is
coming
out
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade
in
seconds
or
minute,
right,
in
seconds
or
minute
depending
on
the
length
and
depending
on
your
viscosity
that
is
why
that
4
degree
centigrade,
which
we
have
kept
for
some
time
and
that
is
increasing
the
viscosity .
The
moment
viscosity
is
high,
it
will
have
a
good
mixing
with
the
remaining,
once
the
ice
is
formed
on
the
barrel,
this
is
called
the
barrel,that
inner
one,
where
your
ice
cream,
this
is
the
shaft,
right
where,
the
ice
cream
is
mixing,
this
is
called
barrel,
whose
inside
is
highly
polished,
right
this
is
called
barrel.
So,
after
barrel,
you
have
the
refrigeration
with
ammonia
and
then
you
have
the
necessary
insulation
right.
Then,
one
more
thing
here,
we
need
to
know
is
that,
there
is
a
two,
double
pump,
right
this
is
a
double
pump
acting
as
pumping
in
the
air ,
which
is
required
and
also
pumping
in
the
mix,
ice
cream
mix,
right
ice
cream
mix,
what
it
is.
So,
in
the
beginning,
I
had
shown
the
solids
liquids
they
are
mixed,
right
and
then
it
is
pasteurized,
then
it
is
homogenized,
then
it
is
cooled,
then
it
is
stored
at
4
degree
for
ageing
and
there
it
is
4
degree,
and
4
degree,
and
it
is
a
mix
of
all
liquid
and
other
constituents,
right.
So,
then
it
enters
into
the
freezer ,
and
comes
out
at
minus
5
degree
centigrade
where,
it
is
a
liquid,
or
semi,
not
liquid,
semi
liquid,
semi
solid,
it
should
be,
right.
So,
this
acts
as
a
dual
pump,
not
double,
better
word
is
dual
pump,
which
is
pumping
air
as
well
as
the
ice
cream
mix
in
the
two,
both
goes
together ,
enters
the
entry
point
and
this
is
the
entry
point,
where
you
have
4
degree,
your
design
has
to
be
such
that
by
the
time
it
comes
to
the
end,
it
is
minus
5
degree.
So,
accordingly ,
the
length
and
diameter ,
both
length
and
diameter
are
designed,
right
as
well
as
the
flow
rate
because,
that
will
depend
whether
you
are
having
a
300
liters
per
hour ,
or
200
liter
per
hour ,
or
700
liter
per
hour ,
right.
So,
that
will
give
again
in
turn
you
the
retention
time
of
the
ice
cream
mix
in
the
ice
cream
freezer
right.
So,
if
we
have
understood
this,
we
are
skipping,
some
these
are
some
parts,
ok,
that
was
a
horizontal
type
of
ice
cream
freezer ,
this
is
a
vertical
and
this
is
done
by
our
Indian
company ,
like
alpha
laval,
right
that
was
perhaps
an
APV ,
entering
at
4
degree
and
leaving
at
minus
5
degree,
but
in
the
horizontal
one,
you
did
not
have
to
take
care
of
the
of
the
gravity ,
right
you
did
not
have
to
take
care
of
the
gravity .
So,
here
you
have
to
have
the
gravity
also.
So,
accordingly
the
design
is
made
accordingly ,
diameter
accordingly ,
the
length
is
designed,
right.
So,
this
is
why
then
vertical,
because
in
many
cases,
as
I
said,
when
we
were
in
Bombay ,
right,
Quality
ice
cream
was
there,
there
the
place
who
is,
where
the
space
is
a
problem,
very
high
floor
space
price
there,
this
vertical
one
is
very
very
helpful,
right,
it
does
not
take
much
space
right.
And
that
is
why ,
otherwise
this
will
be,
may
be
couple
of
meters
from
this
side,
to
that
side,
but
here
may
be
in
a
meter
it
can
be
accommodated
right,
that
is
the
advantage
of
it.
So,
this
how
the
vertical
one,
ok.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
the
other
one,
this
is
one
which,
we
have
already
said
that
eutectic
point,
eutectic
mixture,
right.
So,
that
eutectic
mixture,
this
is
a
brine
tank,
this
is
a
brine
tank,
whose
temperature
is
minus
30
to
minus
40
o
C,
depending
on
your
requirement.
So,
there
with
the
brine,
that
brine,
what
are
the
components,
that
normally
does
notcome
out
of
the
company .
I
was
with
2
year ,
but
I
also
could
not
make
it
out
what
it
is
made
of
right.
Now ,
inside
is
a
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
system
means
that
evaporator
is
there,
and
that
is
cooling
this
whole
liquid
brine
to
minus
30
or
40
degree
centigrade
and
the
ice
cream
lollies,
which
we
take
so,
they
are
put
in
mould
and
the
moulds
are
floated
or
just
immersed
into
that,
may
be
for
some
hour ,
depending
on
what
you
are
making,
it
will
take
some
hour ,
but
the
thing
is
that
whole
thing
is
liquid.
In
our
childhood
we
had
in
our
school
around
may
be
2,
3
buildings
after
the
school,
after
the
school
and
since
it
is
very
close,
and
you
had
very ,
of
course,
we
did
not
have
any ,
like
you
have,
the
pocket
money ,
we
had
no
such
thing
during
our
childhood,
no
pocket
money ,
etc.,
but
in
spite
of
that
parents
used
to
tell
that
do
not
go
to
that
ice
cream
factory ,
there
it
was
only
like,
this
is
circular
that
was
a
rectangular
kind
of
thing,
this
kind
of
thing,
we
were
told
that
do
not
go
there
because
this
ice
cream
is
made
from
dirty
water
or
nali
kapani.
Y ou
know
the
thing
is
that
why
a
person
instead
of
taking
water
may
be
from
the
tap,
why
will
be
using
nali
kapani
right,
it
is
because,
we
do
not
take,
right
and
you
obviously ,
you
are
curious,
we
used
to
go
almost
every
other
day
and
that
time
the
owner
of
the
this
brine
tank
that,
who
is
making
ice
cream
lollies,
he
used
to
say
please
remain
away
from
this
tank
and
by
no
means
do
not
put
your
finger
into
it,
then
it
will
be
cut
he
used
to
say ,
it
will
be
cut,
right.
So,
we
were
afraid
of,
we
did
never
put,
of
course,
our
hand,
but
it
being
minus
30,
yes,
there
could
have
been
a
cold
frosting.
So,
that
is
how
I
still
remember
that,
we
used
to
say ,
we
used
to
be
told
that
do
not
take
ice
cream
like
lollies,
right
ok.
Then
we
come
to
another
very
important
one
that
is
called
overrun,
which
I
said
that
90
to
100
percent
105
percent
air ,
and
this
is
measured
by
overrun,
this
is
called
90
percent
overrun
is
90
percent,
or
overrun
is
105
percent,
it
can
be
calculated
by
volume.
So,
overrun,
percent
by
volume
is
like
this
obviously ,
ice
cream
has
more
volume
than
ice
cream
mix,
because
there
is
no
air .
So,
more
volume
is
ice
cream
so,
volume
of
ice
cream
minus
volume
of
ice
cream
mix
over
ice
cream
mix
into
100
is
the
percent
overrun.
So,
I
have
given
some
example
that
if
volume
of
ice
cream
is
say
9.5,
whatever
be
the
unit
of
volume,
and
if
5
is
the
ice
cream
mix
volume,
then
9.5
minus
5
over
5
into
100,
that
is
90
percent
is
the
overrun
right.
So,
that
90
to
105,
which
we
had
said
in
the
beginning
is
nothing,
but
overrun
right.
So,
this
overrun
is
to
be
maintained
at
either ,
not
less
than
90
or
not
more
than
105.
If
it
is
less
than
90,
then
the
manufacturer
has
to
give
more
material
right.
So,
that
will
be
a
less
profit
for
him,
and
if
it
is
more
than
105,
then
you
are
fooled,
you
buyer
is
fooled,
because
you
are
giving,
you
are
given
more
quantity
of
air
than
required.
So,
that
is
why
the
control
unit
or
control
system
has
given
this
the
dictum
that
it
has
to
be
90
to
105
percent
considering
both
the
sides
right,
both
means
consumer
and
the
manufacturer ,
right.
So,
this
is
how
and
of
course,
it
can
also
be
expressed
in
terms
of
by
weight,
but
normally ,
by
weight
is
not
used
because
that
number
is
much
lower
and
maybe
some
decimal,
that
is
why
here
90
to
105
is
more
unique
to
remember .
So,
by
weight
overrun,
the
obviously ,
weight
of
ice
cream
mix
is
more
having
the
same
volume,
ice
cream
mix
has
more
weight
than
that
of
ice
cream.
So,
volume
of
1
gallon
of
ice
cream
mix
minus
volume
of
1
gallon
of
ice
cream
over ,
sorry ,
not
volume,
sorry ,
I
am
sorry ,
weight
of
1
gallon
of
ice
cream
mix
minus
weight
of
1
gallon
of
ice
cream
over
weight
of
1
gallon
of
ice
cream
into
100
is
the
percent
overrun
by
weight
right.
As
I
said,
by
volume
is
the
most
popular ,
by
weight
normally ,
it
is
not
used
again
to
show
that
let
me
say
that
8.85
is
the
weight
of
ice
cream
mix,
5.06
is
the
weight
of
ice
cream,
for
the
same
volume
and
5.06
is
the
weight
of
ice
cream
into
100,
that
becomes
74.9.
So,
in
whatever
combination
permutation
you
do,
it
will
be
very
dif ficult
to
get
the
whole
number
of
80
or
60
or
things
like
that.
For
that
reason,
the
overrun
is
not
expressed
in
terms
of
weight.
It
is
always
in
terms
of
volume,
ok.
Then,
let
us
go
to
this
is
a
real
problem
ok.
Let
me
say
another
thing
very
important
here,
this
one
this
is
a
called
Pearson
square
method.
In
earlier
days,
I
hope
you
have
now ,
you
are
using
all
calculators.
Now ,
a
days
of
course,
your
this
thing
what
this
fellow ,
smart
mobile,
is
also
with
you.
So,
that
is
also
having
calculator ,
but
if
we
go
back
to
days,
back
to
decades
back,
when
there
was
no
calculator
and
I
still
remember ,
my
brother
in
law
who
was
also
a
faculty
here,
he
used
to,
they
used
to
use
slide
rule.
I
have
seen
that,
but
I
did
not
use,
because
our
time,
calculator
was
also
available.
So,
they
used
to
use
slide
rules
before
that
right,
this
Pearson
square,
he
felt
that
the
people
who
are
working,
they
are
under
very
much
stress
why?
That
they
have
to
give
the
detail
of
the
sheet
like,
perhaps,
and
there
it
is,
it
is
used
like
this,
35
percent
of
say
fat
source
is
mixed
with
4
percent
of
another
fat
source.
Then,
you
have
to
get
20
percent,
which
is
at
the
centre,
now
the
question
comes
how
much?
Right,
see
it
can
be
said
16
parts
of
35
percent
of
1
fat
source
if
it
is
mixed
with
15
parts
of
4
percent
of
another
fat
source,
they
do
make
35
parts
of
the
fat,
which
is
having
20
percent
fat
right.
So,
35
parts
you
are
getting
by
mixing,
16
parts
of
35
percent,
15
parts
of
4
percent,
and
getting
31
parts
of
20
percent,
this
we
have
already
shown
you
earlier .
So,
I
am
not
going
to
again
spend
time
on
it
right.
So,
let
us
keep
some
and
this
is
a
typical
ice
cream
scoop,
right
you
are
given
ice
cream
scoop
this,
and
you
have
seen
that
this
is
dipped
in
water ,
right,
it
is
not
for
cleaning,
because
when
it
is
dipped
in
water ,
this
temperature
is
slightly
increased.
So,
scooping
becomes
easy
that
is
why
it
is
dipped
into
water
so
that
the
temperature
is
increased.
Then
this
is
a,
as
we
have
shown
in
the
freezing,
ice
cream
not,
ice
cream
generally ,
that
freezing,
with
the
mechanical
or
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
you
see,
how
much
time
it
takes,
it
is
around
couple
of
hours,
whereas,
with
the
help
of
liquid
nitrogen
it
could
be
almost
instantaneously ,
right
maybe
no
time,
or
few
seconds,
or
minutes,right.
Then
this
is
the
cold
chain,
ok.
Now
we
come
to
the
distribution.
There
are,
as
we
have
said,
it
is
stored
in
cold
room
at
minus
18
or
below ,
and
that
is
done
by
again
vapour
compression
refrigeration
system,
and
you
might
have
seen,
if
you
have
any
ice
cream,
further ,
nearby
your
place,
that
there
is
some
ice
cream
coming
through
this
type
of
mechanically
refrigerated
van.
What
is
there
that
machine
that
is
cooling
machine
that
is
placed
over
the
head
of
the
driver
cabin
and
inside
there
is
an
evaporator ,
and
a
fan
and
this
distributes
the
cold
air ,
but
still
it
takes
couple
of
hours
time
to
cool
right.
Then,
we
go
to
another
this
is
called
polar
stream,
where
liquid
nitrogen
is
spread
as
and
when
required,
right
there
is
this
liquid
nitrogen
cylinders,
there
is
a
three-way
valve,
and
as
and
when,
there
is
a
sensor ,
this
sensor
tells
that
temperature
has
gone
up.
So,
some
liquid
is
spread
and
you
know
as
earlier
also
I
said,
1
litre
is
converted
to
800
litre
right
by
volume,
1
litre
liquid
nitrogen
is
converted
to
800
litres
of
vapour
nitrogen.
So,
this
way ,
it
can
be
used,
this
is
called
polar
stream,
and
done
by
British
oxygen,
ok.
Then
we
come
to,
and
these
are
the
how
all
cylinders
are
interconnected
right.
Then,
maybe
there
was
no
fan.
So,
some
fans
are
used,
right
and
this
is
the
last
one
where
this
is
called
dump
char ging
method,
that
means,
you
have
already
calculated
all
the
heat
required
to
tackle
and
then
dumped
air ,
we
have
done
with
liquid
nitrogen,
dumped
all
the
refrigeration
and
temperature
maybe
from
minus
18
brought
down
to
minus
35,
right.
And
this
again,
when
come
back,
comes
back
to
minus
18,
it
can
be
transported
from
one
place
to
other
place,
right.
So,
this
is
how
the
transportation
of
liquid
nitrogen
transportation
of
ice
cream
can
be
done.
Now ,
our
time
is
over
I
am
really
thankful
to
all
of
you
that
you
have
patiently
you
have
heard
my
lectures
and
I
wish
that
you
have
learnt
something
and
that
is
where
is
my
success.
If
you
have
learnt
something
and
one
more
request
from
my
side
that
those
who
have
registered
please
and
again
please
appear
in
the
exam
it
is
only
a
1000
rupees
for
examination
fee
perhaps.
So,
far
I
know
that
you
will
get
a
certificate
and
this
certificate
you
can
utilize
anywhere
in
your
college
because
it
is
under
the
ministry .
So,
your
equivalent
this
thing
credit
course
can
be
taken
out
from
the
normal
your
courses.
So,
this
is
very
very
helpful
and
obviously ,
challenging
you
have
to
appear
in
exam
as
well
as
every
week
you
have
to
appear
or
not
appear
you
have
to
give
some
exam
or
assignment
right.
So,
everything
put
together
when
you
are
taking
so
much
trouble
by
completing
why
you
do
not
appear
in
the
exam.
In
the
previous
one
just
completed
I
think
around
5000
students
they
attended
the
whole
classes
registered
and
attended,
but
only
around
1500
students
appeared
right.
I
do
not
know
whether
everybody
passed
or
not
obviously ,
as
usual
in
the
colleges
andeverywhere
some
people
get
EX,
some
people
get
moderate,
some
people
get
even
lower
and
some
people
also
fail.
So,
here
also
it
will
be
a
similar
distribution
depending
on
your
performance.
So,
it
is
a
challenge.
So,
please
do
appear
in
the
exam.
Thank
you
so
nice
of
you
I
am
so
happy .
Thank
you
all.
