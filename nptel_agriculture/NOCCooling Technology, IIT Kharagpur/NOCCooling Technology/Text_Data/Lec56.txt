Use
of
Phase
Change
Materials
(PCM)
Good
afternoon
my
dear
friends
and
students.
W e
have
finished
one
of
the
major
applications,
that
is
freezing
right.
Now ,
we
come
to
another
very
modern
one,
which
is
coming
up.
I
do
not
say
that,
it
has
come
up,
it
is
coming
up,
that
is,
use
of
phase
change
materials.
So,
what
do
you
understand
by
the
term,
phase
change
materials?
See,
in
the
previous
classes,
you
have
come
across
freezing,
and
freezing
is
a
phase
change
process.
So,
there,
we
have
seen,
water
is
getting
changed
to
ice,
and
ice
is
a
phase
changed
material.
And
in
many
cases,
we
have
seen
that,
ice
is
used
as
one
of
the
refrigeration
system,
for
transporting
many
materials,
right.
Similarly ,
nowadays,
instead
of
ice,
many
other
things,
because
ice
also
has
certain
disadvantages,
like,
it
is
always,
when
it
is
getting
melted,
water
is
obtained.
Now ,
if
it
becomes
watery ,
then
there
are
many
systems,
which
are
not
suitable
for
using
ice,
as
transportation
system,
for
which,
in
modern
days,
it
is
of
course
still
under
research
condition
or
still
research
going
on
to
commercialize.
But,
someday ,
obviously ,
it
will
be,
because
it
is
also
a
system,
where
you
are
handling
with
materials.
So,
selection
of
materials
is
one
of
the
prime
factor .
Just
you
think,
in
this
way ,
ice,
you
know ,
it
is
having
a
latent
heat
of
how
much?
335
kilo
joules
per
kg.
So,
335
kilo
joules
per
kg,
ice,
that
is,
a
huge
quantity
of
heat,
which
you
are
getting,
but,
because,
again,
as
I
said
that,
ice,
the
problem
is,
when
it
is
melting,
it
is
also
causing
watery ,
all
around.
There
may
be
some
systems,
which
it
is
suitable,
for
example,
when,
in
India,
when
fish
is
getting
transported
from
one
part
to
other ,
it
is
mostly
by
ice.
Because,
if
ice
is
melted
to
water ,
fish
will
not
have
that
problem,
but,
you
imagine,
something,
where,
your
water
is
not
allowed
to
touch
that
product,
then,
it
is
not
possible
to
transport
with
ice,
directly
in
contact,
of
course.
But
the
moment,
you
have
again
ice
as
a
primary
refrigerant,
and
it
is
cooling
somebody
else,
who
is
in
turn
cooling
somebody
else,
then,
a
lot
of
heat
transfer ,
heat
losses
are
happening.
So,
consumption
will
go
very
very
high,
that
is
not
also
desirable.
T o
overcome
this,
researchers
are
looking
into
the
application
of
phase
change
material,
which,
is
our
this
classes
talk,
right.
So,
use
of
phase
change
materials,
for
application
of
food,
and
otherthings.
What
we
understand
by
phase
change
material,
that
is
PCM?
It
is
just
like
that;
it
is
in
a
cycle.
How
that
the
temperature
of
the
material
gets
lowered
or
falls?
So,
you
are
obtaining
a
PCM,
which
is
solidified,
heat
ener gy
is
released
back
into
the
environment,
and
it
may
do
capsulation,
encapsulation
etc.
that
is
separate
part.
But,
in
general,
so,
you
are
getting
that
PCM
material,
where,
temperature
is
rising
because
it
is
giving
away
the
heat
or
cold
to
the
other
in
a
particular
case.
So,
when
you
are
transporting
something,
see,
you
are
transporting
this
material
from
here
to
there.
So,
it
is
supposed
to
be
at
certain
temperature,
and
that
is
maintained
by
say ,
a
neighboring
system,
which
is
under
phase
change
condition.
So,
that
phase
change
material
will
give
in
turn
to
this
and
you
are
obtaining
a
dry
transportation
system,
right.
So,
the
temperature
rises
and
then,
again
it
is
becoming
liquid
or
semi
solid
depending
on
the
material.
So,
as
PCM
absorbs
heat
ener gy ,
it
liquefies
again,
that
the
cycle
is
going
on,
right.
So,
it
is,
that
means,
heating
and
cooling
and
heating
cooling
and
heating,
this
cycle
is
going
on.
As
I
said,
yes,
ice
has
a
temperature
of
0
degree
centigrade,
right,
but,
if
you
have
some
material,
which
can
be
solidified
at
say ,
minus
12
degree
centigrade,
and
is
solid,
and
it
is
having
a
high
latent
heat,
then
it
may
be
very
useful,
because,
if
it
is
liquid,
may
be
at
higher
temperature,
may
be
say
10
degree
centigrade,
it
is
liquid.
So,
from
minus12
to
10
it
is
giving
the
latent
heat,
and
latent
heat
being
high,
so
it
can
be
utilized
accordingly ,
judicially ,
right.
So,
this
is
the
basic
of
the
phase
change
material,
and
what
is
that?
That
is,
you
have
to
have
some
components,
which
may
be
liquid
at
higher
temperature,
it
may
contain
in
some
container ,
and
that
is
first
phase
changed,
and
then
after
changing
of
phase,
it
is
solidified
and
that
solid
is
giving
the
latent
heat,
and
may
be
little
sensible
heat
also,
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
phase
change
material,
and
then,
it
is
liquefying
and
after
that
again
it
is
coming
back
to
solid.
So,
these,
to
and
fro
of
the
heat
for
solidifying
and
getting
liquefied
by
exchanging
heat
with
the
material,
to
be
taken
care
of,
that
is,
what
is
the
prime
principle
of
the
phase
change
system,
right.
Now ,
three
major
factors
that
qualify
phase
change
material.
Now ,
phase
change
material
can
be
reused
for
a
number
of
times
with
same
capability ,
this
is
one
very
good
advantage.
Second,
it
releases
or
absorbs
ener gy ,
while
maintaining
the
constant
temperature,
as
we
said,
when
it
is
giving
away
the
latent
heat,
so,
the
temperature
is
constant
and
compared
to
other
material,
it
has
high
latent
heat
storage
capacity ,
that
is
what
in
the
beginning
I
said.
Y ou
have
to
select
the
material,
whose
latent
heat
is
very
high
right.
So,
here,
one
such,
this
is
water ,
this
is
stone,
this
is
wood,
this
is
plastic
and
this
is
phase
change
material,
if
there
be
a
delta
T
of
15
K
right.
So,
it
is
most
likely
that,
this
phase
change
material
is
very
much
useful,
having
highlatent
heat
ener gy
storage
capacity ,
right.
This
is
one
such
consistency
in
performance
over
substantial
number
of
cycles,
this
is
how
it
is
not
very
up
and
down.
Then,
heating
without
Pcm
will
be
like
this,
if
this
is
the
melting
point
of
the
material.
So,
temperature
remains
constant
during
melting.
So,
like
that
and
heating
with
Pcm
will
be
like
this.
So,
this
is
again
further
explanation
of
the
Pcm
or
phase
change
material.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
classification
of
the
phase
change
material,
we
can
say
that,
phase
change
material,
that
can
be
classified
as,
whether
it
is
or ganic,
or
inor ganic
or
eutectic,
right.
If
it
is
under
or ganic,
then,
whether
it
is
paraf fin,
or
non-paraf fin,
or
if
it
is
inor ganic,
whether
it
is
salt
hydrated,
or
metallics.
And
for
eutectic
types,
it
could
be
or ganic,
or ganic
eutectic,
it
could
be
inor ganic,
inor ganic
eutectic,
or
it
could
be
a
combination
of
inor ganic
and
or ganic
eutectic.
Eutectic,
in
the
previous
class,
I
have
said,
right.
In
a
solution,
you
have
the
solute
right,
and
depending
on
the
eutectic
temperature,
or
eutectic
point,
it
can
go
up
to
that,
for
sodium
chloride,
we
had
shown
that
it
is
minus
21
point
something
o
C,
right.
So,
that
is
a
purely
inor ganic
one.
Similarly ,
or ganic
one
also,
we
have
said,
about
sucrose,
if
I
remember
correctly ,
so,
it
was
around
minus
12
degree
centigrade,
so
that
is
or ganic.
So,
we
can
classify
phase
change
materials
in
this
way
that,
phase
change
materials
can
be
or ganic,
can
be
inor ganic
or
eutectic
again
if
it
is
or ganic
it
could
be
paraf fin,
it
could
be
non-paraf finic
material
also
or
again
salt
hydrate
I
hope
hydrate
you
understand,
right.
Like,
say
sodium
chloride
NaCl,
I
am
not
sure
about
this
hydration
number ,
say
2H
2
O,
then,
it
is
called
hydrated
sodium
chloride.
If
there
is
no
H
2
O,
associated
then,
it
is
called
anhydrated
sodium
chloride.
Just
for
example,
I
have
given,
it
may
not
be
chemically
or
chemistry
wise
right,
right,
because,
I
am
not
sure
at
this
very
moment,
whether
sodium
chloride
is
hydrated,
or
anhydrated,
perhaps,
not
some
other
material
we
can
take,
right,
and
association
with
the
water
molecule
is
hydrated
and
association
without
water
molecule
is
anhydrated
ok.
Then,
we
come
to
eutectic
point,
or
eutectic
temperature,
which,
we
have
already
said,
right,
that
definition,
we
have
said,
but
for
a
recapitulation,
we
can
say
as
the
freeze
concentration
process
progresses,
solutes
reach
or
exceed
their
respective
saturation
concentrations,
and
simultaneous
crystallization
of
ice
and
solute
becomes
possible,
right.
The
temperature
at
which
a
crystallized
solute
can
exist
in
equilibrium
with
ice
and
the
unfrozen
phase
is
known
as
the
eutectic
point,
or
eutectic
temperature
of
the
solute.
So,
as
we
said,
sodium
chloride
minus
21.13,
sucrose
not
12,
minus
14,
glucose
5,
sodium
carbonate
minus
2.1,
minus
5
glucose.
W e
can
say
that
melting
point,
how
we
can
determine.
So,
melting
point
determination
is
also
one
part
of
the
phase
change
material,
right.
So,
experimental
setup
could
have
been
that,
you
have
one,
you
see,
insulated
thermocouple
container
or
thermocol,
rather ,
thermocol
container ,
like
this,
and
there
isalso
one
metal
container
inside
of
it.
It
has
a
thermocol
cap
over
it.
There
is
a
data
logger
or
data
taker ,
whatever
we
call,
and
thermocouples
are
like
this,
connected
to
the
temperature,
which
is
to
be
found
out
right.
So,
this
is
then
taken
to
the
data
logger
and
that
is
decoaded
by
this
computer
system,
and
from
there
you
can
find
out
the
melting
point
easily .
As
I
said,
this
is
under
research
still.
So,
there
are
some
systems,
like
this,
to
determine
either
melting
point
or
freezing
point
etc.
Now ,
definitely
if
water
is
used
as
a
PCM,
or
phase
change
material,
then
what
we
can
see
that,
heat
ener gy
is
transferred
into
the
ice,
then,
the
heat
is
used
to
break
the
bonds
between
molecules,
not
to
increase
the
average
kinetic
ener gy .
And
since
the
bonds
among
the
ice
molecules
have
been
broken,
water
is
formed,
the
water
molecules,
at
this
moment,
have
the
same
average
kinetic
ener gy ,
as
they
did,
when
they
were
ice.
And
next,
since
the
ice
and
water
molecules
both
have
same
average
kinetic
ener gy ,
they
are
at
the
same
Kelvin
temperature,
right.
So,
if
it
is
water
as
phase
change
material,
right,
but
for
others,
some
more
information
about
the
water
as
PCM
is,
like
that,
this
is
the
solid
PCM,
ok,
this
is
the
liquid
PCM.
So,
cold
ener gy
is
supplied
and
this
also
so,
this
is
by
emitting
and
this
is
by
absorbing,
right.
So,
thereby ,
we
can
find
out
the
melting
temperature,
Tm,
right
as
we
said,
it
is
335,
no
334
kilo
joules
per
kg
right.
So,
1
kg
of
0
degree
centigrade,
this
is
also
1
kg
of
0
degree
centigrade,
but,
this
is
1
kg
of
80
degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
we
can
find
out,
from
this
type
of
curve,
that
is,
the
time
temperature,
which
may
be
obtained
by
several
instruments,
which
have
come
up
nowadays.
And
we
get
the
melting
temperature
is
somewhere
point,
minus
0.015,
since
it
is
experimentally
found,
melting
point
of
ice
is
minus
0.01.
So,
it
is
approximately ,
0
degree
centigrade,
right.
So,
that
can
be
determined,
with
the
help
of
the
instruments,
equipments,
nowadays
available
to
dif ferent
labs,
right.
Then,
ethylene
glycol
as
PCM.
If
we
look
at
ethylene
glycol
can
be
also
used
as
a
PCM,
since
water
can
be
used
as
PCM,
ethylene
glycol
also
can
be
used
as
PCM,
right.
Then,
its
melting
temperature
is
found
out
to
be
minus
12.871
degree
centigrade
or
roughly ,
say ,
minus
12.9
degree
centigrade,
right.
One
thing
you
are
observing,
water
is
melting
point,
we
have
seen
somewhere
0
degree
centigrade.
This
ethylene
glycol
has
a
melting
point
of
minus
12
degree
centigrade.
Obviously ,
which
one
will
be
a
better
PCM
material?
W ater ,
because
this
is
at
minus
12.9,
is
the
melting
point.
So,
by
the
time
it
is
coming
to
minus
13,
or
minus
12
degree
centigrade,
it
gets
melted.
So,
again,
so,
at
the
sub
0
level,
you
are
working
with
which
may
not
be
desirable.Now ,
it
comes
to
the
selection
of
the
PCM
materials.
Definitely ,
as
you
see
that,
between
the
time
temperature,
and
air
temperature,
air
also,
time
and
air
temperature.
So,
one
says,
top
temperature,
this
one,
this
is,
says
middle
temperature,
this
one,
and
this
is
saying
bottom
temperatures,
this
one,
right.
So,
temperature
range,
if
it
is
3
to
6
degree
centigrade,
air
temperature
profile
inside
a
storage
chamber ,
if
we
look
at,
if
that
be
the
profile
of
air
temperature,
this
way
obviously ,
your
obviously ,
you
have
also
said,
this
in
our
in
our
CA
storage
right.
So,
you
can
control
within
a
limit,
right.
This
will
vary ,
like
this
in
our
CA
storage
also,
temperature
was
varying
with
plus
minus,
maybe
1
degree,
like
that
exponential
1,
right.
Because,
you
have
to
also
depend
on
the
sensors,
and
the
recorders,
or
the
receivers,
its
ef ficiency ,
right.
So,
this
could
be
a
one,
which
is
for
air .
Now ,
if
we
use
polyethylene
glycol
400,
there
are
many ,
as
I
said
that,
lot
of
research
is
going
on,
and
this
is
fundamentally
the
material
selection,
fundamentally ,
because,
we
have
already
said,
how
the
PCM
is
working,
right.
If
we
know
that,
PCM,
how
it
is
working,
then
that
means,
PCM
is
extracting
heat
from
the
material
and
thereby
changing
its
phase,
whereas,
the
material
is
remaining
at
the
desired
temperature.
So,
there
are
many ,
when
you
need
to
take
eutectic,
we
have
also
said,
at
given
the
example
of
many .
So,
depending
on
the
material,
so,
one
such,
it
is
polyethylene
glycol
400,
its
properties
are
like
that,
it
is
colorless
liquid
at
room
temperature,
low
toxicity ,
that
is
also
required,
melting
temperature
is
5
degree
centigrade,
and
the
formula
is
like
this,
molar
mass
is
380
to
420
g
per
mole.
Density
is
somewhere
1.124
to
1.126
kg
per
centimeter
cube,
and
latent
heat
of
fusion
is
150.98
kilo
joules
per
kg,
obviously ,
much
lower
than
that
of
the
ice,
but,
still
it
could,
because
its
melting
point
is
high,
so,
it
could
be
one
of
the
user ,
or
it
can
be
used
ef fectively .
Then,
say
how
we
are
finding
out
experimentally ,
right,
obviously ,
data
recorder
through
computer
and
this
is
a
say ,
the
box,
where
you
are
keeping
your
material
to
be
tested.
Thermocouples
are
used.
There
are
many
places,
where
thermocouples
have
been
used,
right,
in
the
right
place.
So,
this
way
you
can
monitor ,
we
have
been
monitoring
that,
how
the
PCM
is
using,
obviously ,
I
cannot
tell
you
the
name
of
this
particular
PCM,
as
I
said
that,
these
are
under
research
work.
So,
cannot
be
disclosed,
but
the
inside
of
the
material,
which
I
had
shown,
the
previous
air
temperature,
right,
inside
of
the
material,
how
it
is
being
calculated,
how
it
is
being
experimentally
found
out,
that
I
am
showing
it
here,
ok.
Then
before
I
say
thank
you,
because
time
is
also
over ,
before
I
say
you
thank
you,
what
I
would
like
to
exchange
with
you
is
that,
this
phase
change
material
being
very
very
new ,
is
not
more
than
few
years,
may
not
be
even
a
decade,
the
prime
attraction
or
prime
consideration
is
being
given,
such
that
dif ferent
phase
change
material,
one
thing,
wehave
to
keep
in
mind,
it
should
have
high
melting
point,
and
high
latent
heat.
These
two
are
the
fundamental,
melting
point
should
be
high,
and
latent
heat
has
to
be
very
high,
then
it
can
serve
as
a
phase
change
material
very
well,
and
the
sooner
it
is
discovered,
or
it
is
found
out,
comes
in
the
market,
many
many
materials
will
have
very
good
transportation
and
the
temperature
can
be
kept
that
it
desired
one,
ok.
So,
with
this,
I
thank
you
for
listening
to
this
class.
Thank
you
very
much.
