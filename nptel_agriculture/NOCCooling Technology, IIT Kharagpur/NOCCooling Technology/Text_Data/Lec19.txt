Psychr ometrics Contd
Good
morning.
We
have
started
in
the
previous
class
Psychometrics,
right
and
we
said
that
it
is
very
very
important,
which
we
need
to
know .
So,
we
are
continuing
that
psychometrics
because
it
was
not
over
in
a
class.
We
came
to
the
level
of
relative
humidity .
We
said
that
there
are
7
properties
which
are
associated
with
psychometrics.
And
if
you
remember ,
we
said
that
dry
bulb,
which
we
have
defined,
wet
bulb,
that
also
we
have
defined,
saturation
temperature,
we
have
defined,
or
dew
point,
we
have
defined
and then  relative humidity , we started with.
And
there
are
many ,
relative
humidity ,
is
the
fourth,
then
fifth
one
will
be
your
absolute
humidity ,
or
humidity
ratio,
sixth
one
will
be
volume,and
seventh
one
will
be
enthalpy
right.
So,
we
are
going
one
by
one.
Till
now,
we
have
done
with
a
little
relative
humidity ,
and
we
have
said,
why,
it
is
said,
relative,
isn't
it,
we
have
already
said,
why,
it
is
relative.
Now
let
us
look
into
humidity ,
relative
humidity ,
some
more,
that
humidity
reflects to the amount  of moisture, that is water vapour in the surrounding air .
Then,
relative
humidity
is
a
measure
of
the
amount
of
moisture
in
the
air
compared
to
the
amount
of
moisture,
the
air
can
hold
right.
How
much
air
can
hold?
You
ask
yourself,
that
how
much
air
can
hold?
Air
can
hold
till
it
is
coming
to
saturation,
once,
it
is
saturated,
then
it
will
drop,
it
will
condense,
but
till,
it
is
coming
to
saturation,
that
much,
it
can
hold
right.
So,
that
is
why
relative
humidity ,
in
another
word,
is
also
said,
it
is
a
measure
of
holding
the
moisture,
capability
of
holding
the
moisture.
So,
40
percent
relative
humidity
means
40
percent
is
full
now
another
60
percent
to
go
to
100
percent.
It
can
hold,
that
is
what
is
40
percent
relative
humidity
meaning,
if
it
is
95
percent
relative
humidity
then
already
95
percent
is
there
then
it
can
hold
5
more
percent
to
become
saturated 100 percent right.
So,
it
is
called,
water
holding
capability
right,
that
is
what
we
are
saying
here.
The
relative
humidity
is
a
measure
of
the
amount
of
moisture
in
the
air
compared
with
the
amount
of
moisture
that
air
can
hold
at
the
same
temperature,
right.
So,
another
way
of
saying
relative
humidity
is
like
this,
relative
humidity
is
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
how
much
moisture
the
air
could
possibly
hold
at
the
temperature
it
happens
when
youmeasure
it
right.
So,
it
is
also
a
function
of
temperature
right,
It
is
also
a
function
of
temperature
because
we
are
saying
that
it
is
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
how
much
moisture
the
air
could
possibly
hold
at
the
temperature
it
happens
when
you
measure
it
right.
It
is
a
function
of
temperature
surely
then
the
wetter
or
damper
you
feel,
the
higher
is  the relative humidity , the wetter or damper , you feel.
If
you
feel
the
air
is
dry
around
you,
the
relative
humidity
is
low.
So,
in
this
respect
let
me
say
that
hopefully ,
many
of
you
have
visited,
say
Rajasthan,
during
summer ,
right
and
you
have
observed
that
if
the
outside
temperature
is
say,
40,
42,
44,
you
are
feeling
that,
yes
it
is
not
44,
it
is
something
50
around,
why?
Temperature
is
42,
and
you
are
feeling
that
it
is
around
48,
50
why?
The
reason
is
that,
the
relative
humidity
there
is
very
low.
So,
around
you,
the
relative
humidity
being
low,
you
are
feeling
very
much
dried,
and
that
is
why
you
are
feeling
more
heat
compared
to
the
actual.
The
same
is
true
when
you
go
to
high
altitude,
say
Kashmir
or
Ladakh,
or
Darjeeling,
or
any
such
place,
right,
Ooty ,
any
such
place
during
winter .
Then
what
you
see
that
if
the
relative
humidity
is
there,
very
high,
that
means,
maybe
some
rain
will
be
coming,
or
something
like
that,
then,
at
that
time,
though
the
temperature
is
not
so
cold,
maybe
4,
5
degree,
but
your
feeling
is
very
very
cold,
because
the
humidity
there
is
very
high,
around
95,
97,
98
percent and you are feeling more damper or wetter  right.
So,
this
is
the
reality ,
and
relative
humidity
plays
this
type
of
important
role.
Then,
we
can
say
that
we
are
very
sensitive
to
humidity ,
sweating
keeps
out
our
body
cool
and
maintains
it
current
temperature
right.
If
our
sweat
is
evaporated,
we
feel
comfortable,
but
if
our
sweat
is
not
getting
evaporated
the
extent
of
uncomfortability
is
very
very
high
right.
So,
this
you
will
see,
mostly
during
rainy
season,
in
paper
also,
that
what
is
the
relative
humidity ,
and
how
much
discomfort,
what
is
the
level
of
comfort
or
discomfort
that
is
given
in
many
papers
right.
So,
sweating
if
it
is
evaporated
from
the
body
then
that
sweat
is
taking
the
latent
heat
of
vaporization
from
the
body
thereby
keeping
it
cool
and
you
feel
comfortable,
but
if
sweating
is
not
able
to
vaporize
because
of
the
high
relative humidity then you feel  that, no, I should not stay here, blah blah, right.
I
hope
I
am
correct.
So,
if
the
air
is
at
90
percent
relative
humidity
then
sweat
will
not
evaporate
into
the
air,
as
a
result,
we
feel
much
hotter ,
than
the
actual
temperature,
when
the
relative
humidity
is
high
right.
So,
in
many
ways
we
have
explained
this.
The
other
one
is
that
if
the
relative
humidity
is
low,
we
can
feel
much
cooler
than
the
actual
temperature,
because,
our
sweat
evaporates
easily
cooling
the
body .
This
also,
I
have
explained
very
carefully
giving
the
examples
of
both
Rajasthan
and
Kashmir
or
similar
places, right.
So,
we
can
say
that,
relative
humidity
is
such
a
parameter ,
which
is
also
telling
us
aboutour
comfort
level
right.
Then
it
comes,
how
the
relative
humidity
is
measured?
How
can
you
measure
relative
humidity?
So,
humidity
is
measured
by
means
of
measuring
device,
called
hygrometer .
It
is
measured.
It
is
available
in
the
market.
There
are
hygrometer ,
which
are
like
clock,
and
that
is
why
in
industries
you
will
see,
people
are
saying
to
be,
what is the relative humidity etc.
right.
So,
the
most
common
hygrometer ,
there
are
different
types
of
hygrometers
and
the
most
common
hygrometer
is
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb
temperature
and
their
use,
and
another
one
could
be
the
hair
hygrometer .
So,
with
the
help
of
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb
temperature,
you
can
say
the
relative
humidity ,
because
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb,
that
means,
you
are
knowing
two
parameters,
simultaneously .
So,
you
can
locate
from
the
picture
of
the
psychrometric
data.
So,
from
there
you
can
say
that
what
is
the
relative
humidity .
Whether
there,
it
will
be
cool
or
hot
or
your
comfort
level
will
be
very
very
bad, right.
So,
if
it
is,
by
the
help
of
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb
temperature,
then,
you
have
to
have
the
wet
bulb
as
well
the
dry
bulb.
Both
the
cases,
we
have
explained
what
is
wet
bulb,
what
is
dry
bulb
temperature
in
the
previous
class.
So,
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb
psychrometer
consists
of
two
identical
mercury
thermometer ,
one
of
which
has
a
wet
cotton,
or
linen
wick
around
it.
So,
it
contains
one
linen
wick
around
it
and
then,
you
put
some
water ,
and
then
you
blow
some
air,
then
you
will
get
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
Whereas,
for
the
dry
bulb,
you
have
this
thermometer ,
and
there
is
no
wick
or
any
other
thing,
only
it
is
bare
and
you
are
watching
the
dry
bulb
and
in
couple
of
minutes
you
get
the
dry
bulb
and then the wet bulb temperature.
Similarly ,
this
type
of
hygrometer
is
used
in
almost
all
the
educational
institutes.
Here,
evaporating
water
from
the
wick
absorbs
heat
from
the
thermometer
bulb
causing
the
thermometer
reading
to
drop.
The
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
is
compared
on
a
psychrometric
chart.
So,
you
have
come
to
know
the
wet
bulb
as
well
as
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
but
you
cannot
find
out
the
relative
humidity
because,
then
you
have
to
ask
for
what
is
the
then
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
and
the
psychrometric
chart.
So,
unless
you
have
the
psychrometric
chart
you
will
not
be
able
to
find
out
the
relative  humidity .
Of
course,
as
I
told,
you
know ,
nowadays,
many
such,
not
instruments,
but
also
the
many
people
are
working
on
it
and,
they
are
making
the
formulae
or
that
is
called,
write
up
that,
by
which
you
can
determine
giving
one
dry
and
one
wet
bulb
temperature
you
can
find
out
what
is
the
relative
humidity .
So,
this
type
of
software
are
nowadays
available
ok.
So,
the
one
which
I
was
referring
to
you
is
that
the
wet
and
dry
bulb
temperature
that
can
be
measured
with
the
help
of
a
hygrometer .
This
is
calledhygrometer ,
and
perhaps
in
almost
all
the
labs,
whatever
it
be
small
or
big,
a
small
unit
like
this
is
available
and
this
is
called
hygrometer ,
based
on
the
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb
temperature
right.
As
you
see
from
this
picture,
that
you
have
a
handle,
this
is
the
one
you have a handle.
I
hope
during
your
childhood
you
have
used
one
such
toy
where
a
stick
was
there
and
after
that
there
was
a
round
thing
which
was
wrapped
with
some
paper
and
one
stick
was,
when
you
are
rotating
that
stick
was
striking
to
this
and
there
used
to
be
a
noise
or
sound
for
the
children
it
is
obviously
sound
and
they
enjoy ,
but
yes
for
seniors
it
may
be
some
noise
because
the
same
sound
same
thing
is
coming
and
they
become
very
much
annoyed,
but
operationally
it
is
the
same.
You
have
one
holder
like
this
and
you
have
one
dry
bulb
temperature
mercury
in
glass
thermometer
right
and
you
have
another
this
one
that
is
also
mercury
in
glass,
but
here
you
have
put
some
wick,
Which
is
also
having
some
moisture,
some
moisture
you
have
added
to
this
right.
And
now
when
you
start
rotating
it,
like
the
toy
I
just
described,
when
you
are
rotating
it
like
that,
since
dry
bulb
is
open.
So
it
has
no
change,
but
the
wet
bulb,
it
being
having
fully
wet
whether
the
wet
is
full
or
not
that,
also
will
be
reflecting
about
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
If
you
put
a
little
water ,
not
sufficient,
so
that
the
moisture
around
the
bulb,
cannot
be
saturated,
then
there
will
be
less
vaporization,
of
the
water
and
the
appropriate
temperature
will
not
be
recorded.
So
it
is
better
to
put
sufficient
amount
of
moisture
onto
the
bulb
or
do
not
allow
that
bulb
to
come
across
this
type,
of
courses,
because
this
is
the
very
beginning,
and
if
you
are
not
able
to
understand,
then
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
subsequently
adopt
the
new
and
new
things.
However ,
for
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
we
have
the
hygrometer
and
in
most
of
the
colleges
or
universities
this
hygrometer
is
available,
it
is
not
costly ,
it
is
available.
In
really
reality ,
when
this
dry
and
wet
bulbs
are
used,
typically
in
cold
store,
if
you
have
ever
gone
there,
and
if
you
used
to
do
that,
then,
this
rotating
of
the
wet
and
dry
bulb,
oh,
what
I
was
saying,
in
the
industry ,
these
two
thermometers,
are
at
different
places
and
somebody
is
there,
who
will
look
after
that
all
the
time,
some
water
is
there
in
the
wick
and
there
is
a
fan
to
blow
it
and
anybody ,
you
me,
or
anybody
can
go
and
watch,
what
is
the
dry
and
what
is
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
Is
it
not
coming
to
your
mind
why
people
will
be
so,
intuitive,
let
it
be
what
is
there,
let
the
temperatures
be,
one
is
sub
0
or
0
around
another
is
above
0.
Is
it
not
making
you
very
much
annoyed?
It is because, that hygrometer , which we are using here, nobody is there to make it rotate.
So,
one
fan
is
there,
and
that
fan
always
blows
out
some
moisture
from
that
wet
bulb
and
the
thermometer
reads
correctly
to
the
first
or
second
or
third
decimal
right.
So,
we
can
see
that
by
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature,
the
psychrometric
chart
can
be
used
and
psychrometric
chart,
I
have
not
shown
you,
will
show
you
in
the
next
class.
Thepsychrometric
chart
unless
you
know
the
wet
and
dry
bulb
temperature,
you
will
not
be
able
to
find
out
the
other
properties
because
this
wet
and
dry
bulb,
these
two
properties,
two
values
of
the
properties
right.
So,
these
two
values
of
the
properties
will
take
you
to
the
point
which
is
called
the
state
point
1
and
you
will
not,
you
will
maybe,
or
you
may
not
be
able
to
identify ,
but
maybe
after
today ,
if
you
go
and
find
out,
then
you
will
find
out
that
these
are
very
two
friendly
thermometers,
which
give
you,
because
mercury
in
glass
is,
what
we,
by
far
the
most
useful
or
best
type
of
thermometer .
Its
accuracy
as
well
as
its
range
is
also
very
very
good
except,
perhaps,
the
last
one
because,
you
have
one
definite length of this thing,  temperature unit.
So,
until
and
unless
you
are
able
to
locate
it
on
the
psychrometric
chart
you
will
not
be
able
to
find
out
the
rest
of
the
properties
of
the
chart
right.
So,
with
this
I
think
we
conclude
here.
With
the
wet
bulb
and
dry
bulb
and
relative
humidity
measurement,
because
there
is,
as
we
have
already
said,
there
is
another
way
of
measuring
the
relative
humidity ,
but
that
is
normally
not
used,
because
it
is
very
complicated,
it
comes
from
the,
you
know ,
our
here,
everybody's
here
is
a
function
of
temperature,
right
and
moisture
content,
sorry ,
moisture
content,
that
is
relative
humidity .
So,
if
the
moisture
content
increases
or
decreases,
either
they
increase
in
length
or
they
decrease
in
length
right.
So,
with
the
help
of
that
the
second
type
of
hygrometer
is
working,
or
it
is
mostly
used
in
the
industry
level,
but
this
one
is
also
industrial
level,
but
much
more
useful
than
only handling with the dry and wet bulb temperatures ok.
So,
we
complete
this
class
here
we
will
come
to
the
other
type
of
hygrometer
in
the
next
class ok.  Thank you very much.
