Carnot Cycle (Contd.)
Good
afternoon
my
students.
We
are
in
the
last
phase
of
Carnot
cycle
right.
If
you
remember
we
started
with
Carnot
and
today
it
will
be
the
last
Carnot
cycle
plus
and
we
will
be
recapitulating
a
little
then
come
to
some
problem
solution.
In
the
previous
class
we
have
shown
that
what
is
the
efficiency
Carnot
efficiency
that
is
1
minus
Q
L
by
Q
H
and
that
is
1
minus
T
L
by
T
H.
We
have
done
one
problem
also
perhaps
around
62.5
percent towards the ef ficiency .
If,
I
remember ,
we
have
done
the
cycle
from
point
1,
point
2,
point
3,
point
4.
Before
that,
we
had
done
the
state
points
in
psychrometry ,
all
in
detail,
and
all
the
state
points,
we
have
said,
are
reversible
in
Carnot
cycle,
right.
All
the
paths
from
the
state
points
1,
2,
3
and
4
back
to
1
are
reversible.
This
we
have
shown
and
said
many
times.
Apart
from
this,
we
have
also
shown
that,
if
we
have
the
two
hot
and
cold
reservoirs,
and
if
we
have
two
engines,
one
is
reversible
and
another
is
irreversible,
then
the
reversible
engine
will
have
higher
efficiency
than
that
of
the
irreversible,
because
we
showed
that
the
work
done
or
obtained
from
an
irreversible
engine
is
always
less
than
that
of
the
reversible
one
under
the
same
operating
hot
and
cold
reservoirs,
right.
This
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that, both the hot and cold reservoirs, they are to be identical for both the engines.
If
there
is
a
discrepancy ,
definitely
the
output
also
will
be
different,
and
we
cannot
compare.
For
comparison,
it
has
to
be
identical.
We
have
also
shown
that
the
reversible
engine,
whatever
it
is,
producing
work
as
work
output
as
W
R
from
the
hot
reservoir
source
as
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
supply ,
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
supplied,
and
then
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir ,
and
we
reversed
and
showed
that,
since
it
is
reversible,
then
Q
C
quantity
of
heat,
if
it
is
extracted
from
the
cold
reservoir
and
if
W
R
quantity
of
work
is
done
on
the
engine,
then
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
produced,
which
we
had
also
supplied
without
a
reservoir ,
as
if,
this
is
the
reservoir
to
the
irreversible
engine
and
obtain
the
same
W
I
quantity
of
work
and
Q
C
dot
or
Q
C
prime
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir ,
right,
and
by
this,
we
had
said
or
we
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
W
R
is
never
less
than
W
I
because,
that
violated
the
Kelvin
Planck
statement,
and
W
I
is
never
equal
to
W
R,
because
if
W
I
is
equal
to
W
R,
then
it
is
converted
to
a
reversible
engine
only,
right.
Then,
we
had
also
shown
that,
ifthere
are
two
reservoirs
working
under
the
same
two,
sorry ,
if
there
are
two
reversible
engines
working
under
the
same
two
reversible
same
two
heat
and
cold
reservoirs,
then,
the
work
obtained
from
one
engine
is
W
R
1
and
work
obtained
from
the
other
engine
is
W
R
2,
and
we
also,
we
also
showed
that
W
R
1
is
equal
to
W
R
2
and
that
is
why,
yeeta
thermal
R
1
is
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
2
right.
So,
on
continuation
of
that,
this
being
the
last
on
the
Carnot,
we
recapitulate,
a
little,
as
we
are
doing,
we
have
shown
that
this
W
R,
W
I,
Q
C,
Q
C
dot,
that,
if
they
were
W
I,
was
more,
then
that
was
violating
the
current
Kelvin
Planck
statement.
Then,
we
made
W
R
equal
to
W
I,
then,
that
becomes
equal
to
Q
C
equal
to
Q
dot
C.
That
is,
it
is
converting
into
reversible
engine.
Then,
we
also
showed
that,
if
W
I
is
less
than
W
R,
then,
yeeta
thermal
irreversible,
that
is,
W
I
over
Q
H,
and
yeeta
thermal
reversible
is
W
R
over
Q
H
and
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible,
right,
and
we
concluded
from
there,
that,
all
reversible
power
cycles,
operating
between
the
same
two
thermal
reservers,
have
the
same
thermal
efficiencies,
right.
And
here
also,
we
showed
that,
instead
of
irreversible
engine
1,
if
we
substitute
to
that
with
reversible
engine
R
2,
and
another
one
is
reversible
engine,
R
1,
then,
operating
between
the
two
same
hot
and
cold
reservoir
one
is
giving
W
R
1
work,
and
other
is
giving
W
R
2
work,
and
same
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
R
1
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
to
the
cold
reservoir ,
and
if,
we
reverse,
then,
we
got
the
same
Q
H
as
output
and
Q
C
as
input
and
W
R
1
was
done
on
the
system,
and
when,
we
supplied
it
to
the
R
2,
the
same
quantity ,
we
are
getting
Q
H
to
the
reservoir
R
2
to
the
reversible
engine
R
2,
and
W
R
2
work
was
obtained
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
was
rejected.
This,
we
got
to
the
corollary
of
the
Carnot,
that
both
engines
receive,
Q
H,
and
Q
H
quantity
and
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected
for
which,
Q
cycle
becomes
0,
and
W
cycle
also
becomes
0,
for
both
the
engines,
with
one
reversed,
because,
they
are
both
reversible,
right,
and
here,
we
can
also
show ,
tell,
one
more
thing,
let
me
say
that,
instead
of
this,
instead
of
this,
that
you
are
supplying
Q
H
and
Q
H
you
are
obtaining,
you
could
have
done
the
same
thing
with
air,
you
have
done
supplied
Q
H,
you
had
supplied
air
Q
C,
and
you
obtain,
the
same
Q
H
and
that
same
Q
H
could
have
been
supplied
to
this
right.
So,
it
is,
yes,
I
mean
irrespective,
whether ,
you
are
getting
it
from
R
1
by
reversing,
or
you
are
getting
it
from
R
2
by
reversing,
because,
both
are
reversible,
right.
So,
that
we
have
not
specially
or
categorically ,
differently ,
we
had
shown,
but
here,
we
are
saying
that,
instead
of
R
1
reversing,
we
can
also
reverse
R
2
and
obtain
the
same,
right.
This
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
instead
of
reversing
R
1,
if
we
reverse
R
2.
the
same
Q
C
quantity
of
heat,
we
extract
from
the
cold
reservoir ,
then,
we
obtain
the
same
Q
H
quantity
of
heat,
given
to
the
hot
reservoir ,
and
the
same
will
be,
then,
coming
back
to
the
R
1,
and
there
will
be
no
change.
So,
there
also
you
will
get
W
R
1
equals
to
W
R
2
and
here
also
we
will
get
W
R
1
equals
to
W
R
2
right.
So,
that,
what,
corollaries,
we
are
saying
in
the
cycles
that
becomes
then
reality .
So,
that,
if
we
have
reversed,
and
now
wesaid
that
reversing
can
be
done,
by
either
R
1
or
by
R
2,
the
same
result
will
be
obtained,
right.
So,
Q
cycle
in
both
the
cases
becomes
0
and
W
cycle
also
in
both
the
cases
becomes
0,
because
both
the
engines
with
one
reversed
are
obtaining
the
same
result,
because,
both
are
reversible.
So,
with
one
engine
reversed,
we
got,
and
we
got
this
relation,
that
W
cycle
is
0
is
equal
to
W
R
1
minus
W
R
2
and
that
is
why
we
said
W
R
1
is
equal
to
W
R
2,
if
both
are
reversible.
That
obviously ,
has
to
be
kept
in
mind,
all
the
time,
that
this
is
true,
if
both
are
reversible.
And
if
you
remember ,
in
the
beginning,
when
we
are
starting
with
cycle
Carnot,
or
even
earlier ,
that,
we
were
always,
say,
I
was
always
saying
that,
if
it
is
reversible,
all
the,
all
the
cycles,
if
they
are
reversible,
then,
only
it
is
possible
to
achieve
the
Carnot
cycle.
We
also
will
say,
afterwards,
the
defects
or
difficulties
of
the
Carnot
cycle,
but
not
now,
because
we
are
now
with
the
Carnot
cycle
and
that
Carnot
cycle,
all
possibilities,
all
corollaries,
we
have
stated,
and
we
are
recapitulating
in
the
last
class
of
the
Carnot
cycle.
Now ,
yeeta
thermal
R
1
and
yeeta
thermal
R
2
were
also
shown
to
be
same,
where
yeeta
thermal
R
2
was
equal
to
W
R
2
over
Q
H
and
yeeta
thermal
R
1
is
equal
to
W
R
1
over
Q
H
and
W
R
2
over
Q
H
was
equal
to
W
R
1
over
Q
H
and
that
is
why,
we
can
say,
or
we
said,
rather ,
yeeta
thermal
R
2
is
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
1,
that
is,
what
we
have
shown
right.
Yeeta
thermal
R
2
is
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
1
because,
W
R
1
by
Q
H
is
equal
to
W
R
2
by
Q
H,
which
are
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
1
and
yeeta
thermal
R
2
respectively ,
and
so,
yeeta
thermal
R
2
is
equal
to
yeeta
thermal
R
1
right,
and
this
is
one
corollary
of
the
Carnot
and
that
is
called
second
corollary
of
the
Carnot cycle.
Now ,
from
there
we
came
to
the
principles
of
Carnot
cycle,
and
we
had
said,
as
here
we
have
seen
that,
the
yeeta
thermal
reversible
A
and
yeeta
thermal
reversible
B,
both
are
identical,
right,
and
if
that
be
true,
we
also
said
that
yeeta
thermal
irreversible
is
less
than
yeeta
thermal
reversible,
right,
and
all
reversible
cycles
have
the
same
thermal
efficiency ,
that
also
we
have
said.
Now ,
also
we
said
that,
the
thermal
efficiency
of
reversible
in
Carnot
engines
are
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
W
net
over
Q
H
and
that
was
equal
to
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H,
and
this
is
a
function
of
temperature
only,
that
is,
T
L
and
T
H,
T
L,
is
the
low
temperature,
and
T
H
is
the
high
temperature,
right.
So,
that
low
whatever
it
be,
high,
whatever ,
it
be,
depending
on
that
the
efficiency
will
be
found
out.
Now ,
we
also
found
out
one
efficiency
with
800
Kelvin
as
the
boiler
temperature
and
300
Kelvin
as
the
cooling
tower
temperature.
So,
we
find
found
out
the
efficiency
to
be
62.5.
Now ,
if
we
say,
some
other ,
high
very
high
temperature,
say,
T
H
is
equal
to
say,
1200
degree
centigrade,
right
and
T
L
is
equal
to
say,
400
or
500
degree
centigrade,
T
L
is
say
500,
or
for
simplicity
of
the
calculation
say,
600-degree
centigrade
right.
Then,
yeeta
thermal
we
can
write
to
be
equal
to
1200
minus
600
divided
by
1200,
right
that
was,
that,
1
minus
T
L
over
T
H,
that
is
T
H
minus
T
L
by
T
H.
So,
T
H
minus
T
L
by
T
H.
So,
1200 minus 600 is 600 by 1200 right.  So, this two goes out.
So,
6
by
12
is
equal
to
1
by
2
that
is
0.5,
that
means,
50
percent
efficiency ,
right.
Similarly ,
any
such
problem,
you
can
find
out
the
efficiency ,
whatever
be
the
temperature,
depending
on
that,
you
can
determine
the
efficiency .
Then,
one
more
we
can
take,
smaller
one,
that
one,
we
had
taken
very
high
say,
one
is
100
degree
centigrade
that
is
T
H
equals
to
100
degree
centigrade
and
T
L
is
say
10
degree
centigrade,
right.
Then what will be the ef ficiency? I hope you can do it very well.
So,
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
100
minus
10
over
100,
that
is
90
over
100
that
is
9
by
10,
so
that
means,
0.9.
So,
that
is
90
percent
efficiency
right,
sorry ,
there
is
90
percent
efficiency .
So,
if
these
be
90
percent
efficiency ,
that
means,
if
the
temperature
is
lower ,
efficiency
goes
up,
if
the
temperature
is
higher ,
efficiency
goes
down,
also
the
difference
of
the
temperature,
that
is
also
a
factor ,
because,
here
we
have
taken
only
90
degree
as
the dif ference.  In earlier cases it was, maybe 500, 600 degree centigrade dif ference.
η
th
=W
net
/Q
H
=1-(Q
L
/Q
H
)=f(T
L
,T
H
)
η
th
=1-(Q
L
/Q
H
)=1-(T
L
/T
H
).
So,
that
is
also
one
subsequent
classes,
not
in
the
Carnot
cycle,
but
maybe
some
other
will
show
that
yes,
this
is
because
ultimately
this
Q
L
and
Q
H,
that
will
correspond
to
that
will
correspond
to
the
condenser
and
the
evaporator ,
right.
So,
this
gradually
will
come
across.
So,
at
this
very
moment
we
are
not
there.
So,
we
should
not
say,
but
we
have
already
shown
that,
if
the
difference
is
low
then
your
efficiency
is
high.
Say,
another
one
if
T
H
is
equal
to
say
200
degree
centigrade
and
T
L
is
equal
to
say,
40
degree centigrade, right.
Now ,
the
difference,
we
have
taken
moderate
one,
right.
So,
yeeta
thermal
we
can
write
as
equal
to
200
minus
40
divided
by
200.
So,
200
minus
40
means,160
divided
by
200.
So, it is 0. So, 16 means 4 and this is 5 right.So,
that
means,
we
have
got
4
over
5
that
is
0.8.
That
means,
80
percent
is
the
efficiency
right.
So,
we
are
going
high
right.
Again,
we
come
back
to
one
more
because,
this
is
giving
us
practice,
also
that
if
T
H
if
T
H
is
equal
to
say
60
degree
right,
and
T
L
equal
to, it is not possible theoretically , saying say , 0 degree then we got 60 minus 0 over 60.
That
means,
60
by
60
that
means,
1
that
means,
100
percent,
which
is
not
yeah,
it
is
possible,
if
it
is
reversible
Carnot
engine
right,
but
because
it
is
becoming
100
right.
Another
problem
if
we
take,
T
H
to
be
equal
to
say
300
degree
and
T
L
to
be
say
30
degree
then
yeeta
thermal,
that
becomes
equal
to
300
minus
30
over
300
that
means,
270
divided
by
300
and
that
becomes,
so,
it
can
be
divided
by
3.
So,
10
and
it
can
be
divided
by 3, 9.
So,
9
over
10.
So,
again
0.9.
So,
again
90
percent.
So,
depending
on
your
temperatures
you can get the ef ficiencies, right.
This
we
have
done.
Now ,
the
last
one
if
we
do
is
that,
this
is
a
problem,
say
let
us
analyze
an
ideal
gas
under going
a
Carnot
cycle
between
two
temperatures
T
H
and
T
L
right.
So,
1
to
2
is
isothermal
expansion,
that
is
U
1
to
2
is
0,
that
is
isenthalpic
and
Q
H
is
equal
to
Q
1
to
2
that
is,
W
1
to
2
which
is,
integral
of
P
Dv,
is
equal
to
EMR
T
H
ln
of
V
2
by
V
1.
So,
T
L
over
T
H
is
V
2
by
V
3
to
the
power
k
minus
1.
So,
3
to
4
is
isothermal
compression,
that
is
delta
U,
3
this
is
delta
U
3
to
4
is
0.
So,
Q
L
is
equal
to
Q
3-4 is W 3-4 is minus  EMR T L ln of V 4 over V 3.
Therefore,
the
other
one
4
to
1
is
adiabatic
compression,
that
is
Q
4
to
1
is
0.
Therefore,
we
can
write
T
L
over
T
H
is
equal
to
V
1
minus,
V
1
over
V
4
to
the
power
k
minus
1
right.
So,
from
equation
1
and
2,
that
is
this
and
that,
we
can
write,
V
2
over
V
3
is
equal
to
V
1
over
V
4.
Therefore,
V
2
over
V
1
is
V
3
over
V
4.
Therefore,
yeeta
thermal
is
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H
and
that
is
equal
to
1
minus
T
L
over
T
H,
since
ln
V
2
over
V
1
is
equal to ln V 4 over V 3.
It
has
been
proven
that
eta
thermal
is
1
minus
Q
L
over
Q
H
that
is,
1
minus
T
L
over
T
H
for
all
Carnot
engines,
since
the
Carnot
efficiency
is
independent
of
the
working
substance
right.
So,
with
this,
let
us
conclude,
our
Carnot
cycles.
Now ,
we
will
obviously
go
to,
this
was
for
Carnot
engine,
right,
will
may
be
going
to
the
Carnot
refrigeration,
or
many others ok. So,  our time is up today .
Thank you for your listening. Thank you.
