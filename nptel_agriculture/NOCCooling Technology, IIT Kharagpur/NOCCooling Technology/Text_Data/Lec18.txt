Psychr ometrics
Good
morning.
In
the
previous
classes,
we
have
covered
basics
of
thermodynamics
that
is
one
very
very
essential
part
which
we
have
covered.
Now ,
we
will
also
take
up
another
very
important
one,
with
respect
to
our
cooling
that
is
called
psychrometrics.
I
hope
you
have
heard
the
word
psychrometrics,
even
if
you
have
not
then
let
us
start
it
and
let
us
understand.
Because,
this
is
one
of
the,
again
fundamental
thing,
which
we
should
know
whenever
you
are
dealing
with
the
cooling
technology ,
or
this
psychrometrics
is
not
only
in
cooling,
but
also
may
be
in
drying,
in
freezing,
in
drying
mostly ,
in
vapour ,
liquid,
all
these
are,
psychrometrics
is
a
part
and
you
must
know
psychrometrics
right.
So,
let
us
start
psychrometrics,
right
as
you,
it
is
a
colorful
one,
yes, it is a colorful  one.
So,
what
are
the
objectives?
Why
should
we
know
psychrometrics?
If
we
know
psychrometrics,
then
we
can
be
able
to
define
what
is
psychrometrics,
and
we
can
understand,
the
importance
of
psychrometrics.
We
can
find
out
the
properties
of
air,
they
are
needed
for
psychrometrics.
We
can
be
able
to
define
properties
of
air,
and
we
should
be
able
to
read
a
psychrometric
chart.
Afterwards,
I
will
show
you
how
a
psychrometric
chart looks like, but these are the objectives.
that
we
should
know ,
we
should
know ,
we
should
define
psychrometrics,
we
should
know
the
properties
all
these
are
supposed
to
be
known.
Then
utility
of
psychrometric
chart
is
that
you
should
be
able
to
locate
a
state
point.
I
have
told
earlier
many
times
about
state
point.
So,
here
it
is
more
emphatic
that
we
should
be
able
to
locate
a
state
point
on
a
chart
when
value
for
any
two
properties
are
known.
Why
two
properties?
Why
not
only
one
property?
Since,
I
have
no
reply
from
your
side,
I
assume
that
you
have
rightly
said,
but
just
take
it
in
this
way
that
whenever
we
are
talking
about
any
chart,
whatever
be
the
chart,
which
is
visible
in
books
and
many
other
places,
we
see,
and these charts or figures or similar  things are all two dimensional right.
They
are
two
dimensional,
one
is
x,
or
rather ,
one
is
y
and
another
is
x
right.
So,
this
y
versus
x
this
we
have
seen
all
the
charts,
all
the
figures,
everything
that
is
why
at
least
two
properties
are
supposed
to
be
known,
then
only
you
can
locate
the
state
point
right.You
should
be
able
to
determine
values
for
the
other
properties
of
air,
once
a
state
point
is
located
in
the
chart
right.
You
have
located
one
state
point
from
two
property
values,
from
that
state
point,
you
can
find
out
many
other
property
values,
which
are
associated
at
that
state
point.
Mind
it,
every
time,
we
had
said
earlier
also,
we
will
not
repeat
that,
these state points  are thermodynamically in equilibrium condition right.
The
equilibrium
conditions,
these
state
points
are
right.
So,
you
should
be
able
to
move
from
one
state
point
to
other
state
points.
So,
we
have
now,
we
have
the
pen.
So,
we
can
use.
So,
we
have
one
graph,
like
this,
right
anything
like
ph,
fine
normally
it
is
of
course,
not  ph, this is PV  right.
So,
if
it
is
not
PV
it
should
not
be
said
let
it
be
PV
right.
So,
if
we
know
one
pressure
and
one,
that
is
P
1
V
1
then
this
is
the
point,
and
this
is
the
state
point
1.
We
want
to
move
to
another
point,
called
P
2
V
2
right.
How
shall
we
move?
Shall
we
move
like
this,
shall
you
move
like
this,
shall
you
move
like
this,
how
shall
you
move?
Once,
we
know
that
how
we
have
to
move,
then
we
can
move
from
point
1
to
point
2
right.
So,
that
is
both
the
state
point
properties
are
supposed
to
be
known
then
only,
and
the
way
you are asked to move, you can reach the point 2 right.
So,
this
is
how
a
psychrometric
chart
is
useful
right.
Now ,
some
more
things
which
we
also
need
to
know
are
that
what
are
psychrometrics
as
definition.
By
definition,
we
can
say,
psychrometrics
is
a
term
to
describe
the
relationship
of
the
7
properties
of
air
and
how
these
properties
change
as
the
heat
and
moisture
content
of
air
changes.
That
means,
we
have
air,
we
have
air
ok.
So,
we
said
that
psychrometrics
is
a
term
to
describe
the relationship of the 7 properties  right.
7
properties
of
air
and
how
these
properties
change
as
the
heat
and
moisture
content,
fundamentally ,
heat
and
moisture
content,
of
air
changes
right.
So,
we
can
then
define
what
is
psychrometrics,
right
and
after
this
we
will
see
what
are
the
7
properties
we
are
referring
to.
The
7
property ,
importance
of
psychrometrics,
before
coming
to
the
7
properties,
importance
of
psychrometrics
are
like
this.
The
principles
of
heating
and
cooling
are
based
on
psychrometrics
right.
For
example,
we
have
a
beaker
where
we
have some water , and if it is a closed one right.
So,
there
will
be
heating
into
the
beaker .
So,
moisture
will
come
out
from
there
and
accumulate
right.
So,
if
outside,
there
is
a
cooling
jacket,
then
this
moisture
will
condense
and
drop
back.
How
these
changes
are
happening?
Psychrometrics
can
be
used
and
you
can
easily
tell
the
properties
of
the
air
water
or
air
moisture
combination.
Now ,
another
thing,
which
we
need
to
know
is
that
psychrometrics
can
be
used
to
predict
changes
in
the
environmental
or
environment,
when
the
amount
of
heat
and
or
water
inthe  air changes right.
So,
this
is
another
way
of
saying
the
usefulness
of
psychrometrics,
and
the
third
one
could
be
the
psychrometrics
can
be
used
to
predict
the
cost
of
drying
a
biological
system.
Now ,
this
is,
in
most
of
the
cases,
very
difficult,
because,
cost
is
not
dependent
on
some
single
parameters.
It
may
be
functions
of
many
many
parameters,
but
however ,
we
can
have
some
idea
about
the
cost
involvement.
Now ,
here
we
come
to
the
properties
which
we
are
referring
to,
that
the
properties
of
air
required
for
psychrometrics
are,
dry
bulb
temperature,
wet
bulb
temperature,
saturation
temperature,
relative
humidity ,
humidity
ratio,
volume,
and
lastly
enthalpy .
I
repeat,
the
seven
properties,
which
are
obtained
or
available
from
psychrometrics
are
dry
bulb
temperature,
wet
bulb
temperature,
saturation
temperature,
relative
humidity ,
humidity
ratio,
volume,
and
enthalpy
of
the
air
water
mixture or combination right.
So,
these
seven
properties
of
enthalpy ,
volume,
humidity
ratio,
relative
humidity ,
saturation
temperature,
wet
bulb
temperature
and
dry
bulb
temperature
are
the
seven
properties
associated
with
psychrometrics.
Now
it
comes,
what
we
understand
by
dry
bulb
temperature.
I
have
given
earlier
also,
this
reference
that,
when
somebody
is
sick
having
temperature,
every
house
has
a
thermometer ,
generally
that
thermometer
is
glass
in,
rather ,
rather ,
rather ,
mercury
in
glass,
that
is
mercury
in
glass
thermometer
having
a
bulb
like
this
right.
So,
if
we
draw ,
it
becomes
like
this
and
then
here,
your
bulb
is
there,
right
and
there
is
graduation
in
this
and
you
can
see
through
the
movement
of
the
mercury
right.
So,
this
bulb,
when
it
is
empty ,
only
the
bulb,
that
time,
the
temperature
recorded is known  as the dry bulb temperature.
So,
the
temperature
recorded
by
a
dry
bulb
mercury
thermometer ,
that
can
be
either
in
Fahrenheit
or
in
centigrade
right.
Because,
nowadays,
particularly ,
for
household
capacity ,
or
household
use,
the
thermometer
available
is
graduated
both
in
Fahrenheit
and
in
centigrade.
Only
the
difference
is
that
Fahrenheit
you
have
universal
line
sorry ,
Fahrenheit
you
have
universal
line
this
is
99,
this
is
98,
this
is
97
like
that
and
of
course,
in
between
they
are
graduated
right.
So,
these
are
whole
numbers
easy
to
remember
whereas,
if
you
convert
99
to
centigrade
this
will
become
somewhere
some
36
point
something this is not exact I am just giving idea 36.
5
or
maybe
36.8
or
maybe
37.1.
So,
it
is
very
very
difficult
to
visualize
that
what
is
the
range
of
temperature
how
it
is
important
to
consult
doctors
right
that
is
why
still
today
though
SI
units
are
there,
but
Fahrenheit
is
so
useful
because
of
its
digital
digit
means
unit
that
you
whole
number
that
whole
number
you
are
using
98,
97,
96,
99.
So,
these
97
these
numbers
are
very
very
useful
and
the
bulb
which
is
recording
it
is
called
the
dry
bulb temperature.  Then another property which we have said is wet bulb temperature.The
same
thermometer
which
you
have
used
for
finding
out
your
body
temperature
if
you
wrap
with
one
cotton
or
some
maybe
cloth
and
put
it
in
water
right
deep
in
water
and
now
you
if
you
blow
a
little
layer
a
little
air
or
force
some
air
then
what
will
happen
the
latent
heat
of
vaporization
of
the
water
from
the
cotton
or
cloth
will
be
taken
from
the
bulb
right.
So,
that
will
bring
down
the
temperature
right.
So,
is
it
that
if
we
have
the
cotton
here
and
if
sufficient
water
is
there
and
if
we
go
on
blowing
will
the
temperature
go
on
decreasing
there
is
a
question
perhaps
not.
It
will
not
go
beyond
certain
temperature
and
that
certain
temperature
is
known
as
wet
bulb
temperature.
So,
the
temperature
recorded
by
a
mercury
thermometer
which
has
a
wet
cloth
cover
and
the
bulb
will
tell
the
temperature
in
either
Fahrenheit
or
centigrade
right
that
is
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
The
question
which
I
asked
that
if
you
go
on
blowing
air
will
the
temperature
go
down?
Yes,
it
will
go
down
till
it
attains
the
wet
bulb
temperature.
It
will
not
go
further
below
wet
bulb
temperature
right
under
that
condition
situation.
So,
dry
bulb
wet
bulb
we
have
seen,
then
it
comes
other
properties,
like
saturation
temperature,
right
we
have
already
talked
all,
many
times
about
saturation.
So,
saturation
temperature,
by
definition
is
the
temperature
at
which
air
is
saturated
with
water
commonly ,
called
the
dew
point,
and
this
can
be
expressed
in
degree
Fahrenheit
right.
This
is
the
time
when
you
see
it,
if
you
go
outside
in
the
very
early
morning,
and
if
you
see
some
leaves,
you
will
see
some
droplets
of
water
are
there
right
where
from
that
droplet
came,
you
do
not
find
any
water
here
there.
So,
where
from
that
droplet
came?
That
droplet
came
from
the
air
surrounding
that
leaf
and
the
temperature
came
to
the
temperature,
known
as
saturation
temperature.
So,
the
moment
it
attained
saturation
temperature,
air
attained
saturation
temperature,
at
that
condition,
the
moisture
condensed,
and
fell
on
to
the
leaf,
which
you
are
seeing
in
the
early
morning.
Obviously ,
with
little
late
morning,
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
because
by
the
time
the
sun
will
dry
it
out,
or
sunlight,
or
sun
ray,
heat
will
dry
it
out,
and
there
will
be
no
such.
But
in
the
early
morning
if
nowadays
it
is
the
time
that
October ,
November
you
see
that
mist
or
moist
in
the
or
water
droplet
on
the
leaf
right.
This
is
because
the
air,
at
that
time
came
to
the
temperature,
which
is
the
saturat,ion
temperature,
and
the
moment
it
becames
saturation
temperature
the
saturated
water
vapour
condensed
and
came out as a droplet right.
Then
relative
humidity ,
right.
Now
the
air
condition
is
very
good,
air
I
mean
dot,
the
air,
AC
air
condition
outside
air
condition
is
very
good,
it
is
neither
hot
nor
cold
more
or
less
everywhere
in
India
more
or
less
except
some
part
of
Tamil
Nadu,
and
Kerala
and
many
other
high
altitude
places,
except
those.
Now ,
in
normal
cases,
all
over
India
it
is
verypleasant,
weather
neither
hot
nor
cold.
So,
you
have
already
crossed
that
time
that
situation
when
you
had
lot
of
sweat
you
had
lot
of
sweat
you
are
outside
lot
of
sweat
were
there
and
you
were
totally
wet
right
that
is
one
condition
of
the
relative
humidity
right.
That
is
one
condition
of
the
relative
humidity
that
outside
relative
humidity
is
so
big
that
you
are
not
able
to
vaporize
your
sweat
which
is
coming
and
that
is
what
is
wetting you.
This
has
happened
very
recently
in
couple
of
months
within
couple
of
months
in
any
part
of
India
right.
So,
relative
humidity
is
a
very
important
parameter
and
why
it
is
called
relative
that
is
also
another
question
should
come
to
our
mind.
Humidity ,
we
understand
that
the
moisture
in
air
is
called
humidity
that
is
by
definition
moisture
in
air
is
humidity ,
but
why
it
is
relative,
whose
relative,
right.
The
moment
we
call
relative,
that
means,
we
always
have
a
comparison
between
either
one
or
two
or
more
right.
So,
it
is
that
the
amount
of
water
in
the
air
compared
to
what
could
be
in
the
air
if
it
is
under
saturated condition.
This
is
expressed
in
terms
of
percentage
right.
So,
the
amount
of
air
in
the
amount
of
water
in
the
air
compared
to
what
could
have
been
in
the
air
had
the
air
been
under
saturated
condition.
That
means,
you
are
comparing,
that
relative
word,
is
coming
here
that
you
are
comparing
with
what
it
could
have
been
under
saturated
condition
than
what
now
is
right.
So,
this
is
what
is
the
relative
with
respect
to
the
saturation,
mine
one
is
present one  is this.  So, this is what is relative humidity right.
So,
I
hope
you
have
understood
why
it
is
relative,
humidity
we
know
is
the
moisture
which
is
in
the
air,
that
is
called
humidity .
But
what
about
that
what
is
in
the
air
at
this
moment,
with
respect
to
that
what
it
could
have
been
under
saturated
condition
ok.
So,
our
time
today
is,
at
least
this
class
is
over.
So,
I
am
very
thankful
for
your
attendance
in
the class, or for you, which you are learning  ok.
So, thank you very much.  Thank you.
