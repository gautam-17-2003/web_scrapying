Gas as Refrigerant(Contd.)
Good
morning,
my
dear
friends
and
students.
We
have
started
a
new
one
in
the
last
class
that
we
are
handling
now
with
the
refrigerant
as
gas
right,
gas
as
refrigerant.
And
there
so
far
I
remember
we
have
said
that
irreversible
COP
for
irreversible
process,
COP
is
less
than
0.
And
for
reversible
processes
the
COP
is
equal
to
0
or
is
the
maximum
right.
So,
from
there
let
us
start
that
let
us
come
to
that
gas
as
refrigerant
continuation
the
maximum
COP
is
COP
of
reversible
cycle
equal
to
T
L
over
T
H
minus
T
L
right.
This
COP
is
the
maximum
that
can
be
achieved
when
the
receiver
temperature
is
T
L
and
the
sink temperature where it is rejected is T H right.
So, it is also clear that the COP  is dependent on the temperature only this in earlier cases
we have also proved right.  And hence for hence independent of working fluid since it is
dependent only on temperature and temperature does not tell whether it is from solid
from liquid or from gas.  So, it is independent of the substance working fluid.  So, the
second theorem is also proved and all the temperatures are in absolute scale, that is
absolute temperature in Kelvin scale, right.
d Q
rev
= T ds.  
∴
 Q
L
= T
L
(s
1
– s
4
) = area under line
4 -1 of Fig. A = Area b – 4 – 1 – a - b.
Q
H
= T
H
(s
2
– s
3
) = area under line 2 – 3 in Fig A
= Area a – 2 – 3 – b – a, and W = Q
H
–
Q
L
= area under line 2 – 3  -  area under line 4 –
1  =  (T
H
– T
L
) (s
1
– s
4
), since, s
1
= s
2
and
s
2
= s
4
= area 4 - 1 – 2 – 3 – 4.
So,
we
can
write
that,
0
degree
centigrade
equal
to,
273.16
Kelvin.
Now ,
there
is
a
small
input
to
this
that,
here
we
have
taken,
273.16
Kelvin.
This
one
may
be
everywhere,
but may be, depending on book, it may vary between 273.16 or 17 or 15.
So,
do
not
get
confused
there,
because,
it
is
book
dependent,
but
we
are
assuming
it
to
be
273.16,
and
this
is
from
the
standard
book
of
ASHRAE,
right.
I
hope,
you
will
find
in
any
standard
library ,
ASHRAE,
right,
American
society
for
heating,
refrigeration
and
air
conditioning
Engineering.
So,
this
is
there,
and
from
there,
we
have
taken
it
to
be
273.16
and this is a society .
So,
that
is
why,
I
said,
many
others
may
differ
a
little,
that
is
independent,
because
this
is
a
prime
number
that
is
0
centigrade,
is
273.16
Kelvin,
ok.
From
the
thermodynamics,
for
reversible
heat
transfer ,
we
can
write
dQ
reversible
is
TdS.
This,
we
have
already
established.
Therefore,
we
can
write
Q
L
is
equal
to
T
L
into
S
1
minus
S
4,
that
is
area
under
the
line
of
4
to
1.
In
the
last
class,
we
had
shown
that,
we
add
this,
right.
So,
Q
L
was
supplied,
right,
and
Q
H
was
rejected,
and
W
work
was
done,
right,
that
is
how
we
got that Q H is equal to Q L  minus  W, right.
So,
from
that,
if
we
look
at
this
that,
dQ
reversible
is
TdS,
and
4
to
1,
if
we
again
go
back
to
this,
T
S
diagram,
where
we
had
like
this,
right.
This
was
1,
this
was
2,
this
was
3,
and
this
was
4.
So,
1,
2,
3,
4.
This
was
our
diagram,
and
which
we
are
referring
to
figure
1,
right.
Similarly ,
that,
this
is
S
1,
this
is
also
S
2.
So,
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2.
This
is
S
3,
and
this
is
S
4,
and
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4,
right.
Whatever ,
could
be
shown
in
the
figure,
we
have
already
described.
And
one
more
thing,
here
is
that,
that
area,
under
the
line
4
to
1, 4 to 1 is this.
So,
the
area
we
can
write
that,
this
is
the
area.
Let
me
clear
it
up,
otherwise,
it
will
be
over
written,
yes,
that
area
is,
if
we
put
it
here,
and
if
we
keep
the
cycle
here.
So,
1,
2,
3,
4,
and
this
is
the
area,
right,
if
we
write
4
to
1,
that
is,
area
under
b
4
1
a
b,
which
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
class,
we
had
shown
you
also,
right.
So,
it
is
b
4
1
a
b.
So,
it
may
be
a,
it
may
be
b.
So,
b
4
1
a
b
is
the
area,
right,
and
Q
H
is
T
H
into
S
2
minus
S
3,
that is, area under 2 and 3, that is, this area.
W = Q
L
/ COP
RC
.
So,
area
under
2
and
3,
is
area
a
2
3
b
a,
that
is,
this
a
2
3
b
a,
this
is
the
area,
right,
and
W
can
be
written
as
Q
H
minus
Q
L
W
is
equal
to
Q
H
minus
Q
L,
that
is,
area
under
the
line,
2-3
minus
area
under
the
line
4-1,
right.
So,
area
under
the
line
4-1,
is
this.
We
have
shown,
area
under
the
line
2-3
is
this.
We
have
shown.
So,
W
becomes
equal
to
this
area,
that
is,
area
under
the
line
2
to
3
minus
area
under
the
line
4
to
1,
right,
and
this
is
equal
to
T
H
minus
T
L
into
S
1
minus
S
4.
This
again,
S
1
is
equal
to
S
2
and
S
2
is
equal
to
S
1
is
S
2
and
S
2
is
equal
to
S
4,
S
2
is
this,
no,
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4,
S
3
is
equal
to
S
4.
Therefore,
we
can
write,
area
4
1
2
3
4,
that
is
4
1
2
3
4,
this
is
the
area
for
the
work, W right.
So,
we
can
write,
we
can
write
that,
the
relative
influence
of
the
two
temperatures,
that
is,
T
H
and
T
L,
on
the
COP.
This
can
be
seen,
by
differentiating
COP
with
respect
to
both
the
temperatures,
that
is,
T
H
and
T
L
right.
Both
the
temperatures,
T
H
and
T
L,
if
we
differentiate,
COP
with
respect
to
T
H
and
T
L,
then
DCOP
RC,
means
reversible
cycle,
DCOP
RC,
DTH,
this
part
DCOP
RC
DTH,
this
is
equal
to
T
L
over
T
H
minus
T
L,
whole
square,
right,
and
DCOP
RC
DTL
is
T
H
over
T
H
minus
T
L,
whole
square,
right.
So,
this
is
differentiating
the
COP
with
respect
to
high
temperature,
T
H,
and
low
temperature,
T
L.
So,
the
COP
of
the
reversed
Carnot
cycle
is,
most
strongly ,
dependent
on
the
low
temperature
at
which
the
heat
is
absorbed,
than
the
temperature,
at
which
the
heat
is
rejected
right.
Because
this
is
from
there
we
have
seen
that
this
is
T
L
over
T
H
minus T L whole square, whereas, it is T H over T H minus T L whole square, right.
So,
the
COP
is,
in
the
reversible
Carnot
cycle
is,
most
strongly
dependent
on,
the
low
temperature
reservoir ,
temperature
at
which
the
heat
is
absorbed,
from
which
the
heat
is
absorbed,
than
that
from
where
the
heat
is
rejected,
or
to
where
the
heat
is
rejected,
right.
So,
from
this
expression
of
the
COP,
it
is
also
clear
that
COP
reversible
cycle,
COP
reversible
cycle
decreases
as
T
H
increases,
or
as
T
L
decreases,
right.
This
perhaps,
we
have
also
said
earlier ,
but
since,
again,
it
has
come
up.
So,
let
us
look
into
that
this
was
our,
four
points,
right,
and
this
was
our
W,
and
this
was
our
Q
L,
right.
So
COP
is
Q
L
over
W,
means
how
much
work
you
have
given,
how
much
refrigeration
or
cooling
effect you have obtained, and this is a T S diagram, right.
So,
the
constant
temperature
was
this,
as
T
H,
this
as
T
H,
and
this
as
T
L,
right.
So,
if
we
increase
T
H,
that
means,
this
line,
if
we
increase,
like
this,
W
is
increasing,
the
moment
W
is
increasing
for
a
given
T
H,
given
Q
L,
if
W
is
increasing
COP
is
decreasing,
that
is,
what
here,
we
are
saying
clear ,
that
the
COP
decreases
as
T
H
increases,
right.
This,
I
have
shown
you
many
many
times.
So,
since,
again
it
has
come,
I
am
showing
you,
so
that
it
is
embedded
into
your
mind,
and
another
one
is
if
T
L
is
decreased,
that
means,
if
we
decrease
T
L,
so,
again,
we,
sorry ,
again,
we
have
that,
1
2
3
4, and this is the T S diagram right.
So,
this
was
our
area
for
Q
L,
right.
This
was
Q
L,
and
this
was
area
for
W,
right.
Now
keeping,
T
H,
this
is
T
H,
and
this
is,
sorry ,
this
was
T
L,
right.
Now ,
keeping
T
L,
ok.
Now ,
keeping,
we
said
that,
T
H,
constant,
keeping
T
H
constant,
if
we
decrease,
that
means,
we
are
lowering
down
T
L,
then,
Q
L
decreases,
whereas,
W
is
increasing,
then,
COP,
as
we
said
is
Q
L
over
W.
So,
Q
L
is
decreasing,
W
is
increasing.
So,
COP
is
decreasing,
that
is,
what
we
also
said
here,
that
COP,
it
is
clear
that
COP
R
C
decreases
as
T H increases, or as T L decreases,  T L is decreasing then COP  is also decreasing, right.Then,
we
can
say
that,
the
work
requirement,
for
the
same
refrigeration
effect
is
W
equal
to
Q
L
by
COP
R
C
right.
So,
W
is
equal
to
Q
L
over
COP
R
C
reversible
cycle,
that
means,
the
work
requirement,
for
the
same
refrigeration
capacity
increases,
as
T
H
increases,
or
T
L
decreases,
right.
So,
of
course,
this,
again,
we
have
said
earlier ,
in
different
platform,
right.
So,
this
is
one,
which
can
be
further
shown,
with
numeral
example.
Numerical
example,
we
can
say
that,
if
the
sink
temperature,
this
is
T
H,
is
equal
to
30
degree,
30
degree
or
40
degree
receiver
temperature,
that
is
T
L
is
minus
10
degree,  minus 20 degree or minus 10 degree combination.
So,
COP
R
C
is
T
L
over
T
H
minus
T
L,
if
the
combination
is
30
degree
T
H
and
T
L
minus
10,
it
is
6.579,
right
and
work
requirement
is
W
over
Q
L,
by
COP
R
C
is
0.52
over
0.152
Q
L,
right.
Now ,
if
it
is
30
degree
and
T
L
is
minus
20
degree,
then
COP
R
C
becomes
equal
to
5.
063
and
the
work
requirement
is
0.198.
And
now
if
the
T
H
is
40
degree
centigrade,
and
T
L
is
minus
10
degree
centigrade
then
COP
is
5.263
that
is
work
requirement
is
0.189
Q
L
right.
So,
from
there,
as
we
see,
from
these
two,
as
we
see,
from
these
two
data
that
both
T
H
is
rather ,
both
T
H
is
constant,
T
L
is
decreasing,
right
then
COP
is
also
decreasing,
right.
And
the
work
requirement
is
increasing,
right
and
if
we
keep
the
other
one,
that
is,
if
we
keep
this
10,
and
this
10,
that
is,
T
L
constant,
for
30
degrees,
this
is
6.579,
whereas,
for
40
degrees,
it
is
5.263,
right.
So,
for
a
given
T
L,
with
the
increase
of
T
H,
the
COP
R
C
is
also
decreasing,
and
the
work
requirement
is
also
increasing.
Sink Temperature
Receiver temperature
COP
RC
=      T
L
/ (T
H
– T
L
)
T
H
= 30
o
C
T
L
= -10
o
C
6.579
T
H
= 30
o
C
T
L
= -20
o
C
5.063
T
H
= 40
o
C
T
L
= -10
o
C
5.263
So,
this,
with
this,
we
have
confirmed,
whatever
we
said
that,
the
effect
of
T
H
and
T
Lon
the
COP
right.
So,
this
table
tells
that,
a
decrease
of
10
degrees
centigrade
of
low
temperature
source,
decreases
COP
reversible
cycle
by
23
percent,
whereas,
an
increase
of
10
degrees
centigrade
in
high
temperature
source,
decreases
the
COP
R
C
by
20
percent.
So,
T
L
is
more
important.
This
shows
that,
low
temperature
source
has
more
dominant
effect
on
the
COP
R
C
right.
Then,
we
come
to
analysis
of
this
cycle,
right,
maybe
it
will
be
requiring
for
the
next
class
also,
because,
it
may
not
be
over
in
this,
class
right,
if
it
is
fine.
Now ,
first
law
of
thermodynamics
says
that
for
an
open
system
in
steady state with one as inlet and two as outlet state.
The
first
law
states
that
m
dot
into,
m
dot
into
h
2
plus
v
2
square
by
2
plus
g
z
1,
minus
m
dot
into
h
1
plus
v
1
square
by
2
plus
g
z
2
is
equal
to
Q
minus
W.
I
hope,
you
could
understand
the
equation,
right.
So,
as
convention,
the
heat
transfer
to
the
system
is
considered
to
be
positive
and
the
work
done
by
the
system
is
also
considered
to
be
positive.
While
applying
first
law
to
the
components
of
the
system,
we
can
say
that
the
specific
potential
energy
change,
that
is
delta
P
e
is
g
into
z
2
minus
z
1
is
considered
to
be
negligible.
Since,
the
height
difference
is
very
very
negligible,
right
the
specific
potential
energy
for
the
pipe
work,
connecting
to
the
components,
may
not
be
there,
also
negligible.
Then,
we
can
say
that,
the
change
in
specific
kinetic
energy,
delta
K
e
is
v
2
square
minus
v
1
square
by
2,
that
is,
it
can
also
be
taken
as
negligible.
Applying
first
law
of
thermodynamics
in
all
components,
that
leads
to,
for
the
first
one,
that
is,
1
to
2,
isentropic
compression,
there,
for
1
to
2
process,
S
1
is
S
2,
and
Q
1-
2
is
0.
And
assuming
that
changes
in
kinetic
and
potential
energies
to
be
0,
for
steady
flow
right
this
positive
sign
indicates
that
work
done
on
the,
negative
sign
indicates
here,
there
should
have
been
a
negative
that
has
gone
here
ok.
That
negative
sign
has
come
here.
So,
it
should
have
been
here.
Negative
sign
indicates
that
the
work
has
been
done
on
the
system for a flow in the open system  for the isentropic process.

This
means
that
minus
W
1-2
is
integral
of
1
to
2,
V
dp,
is
equal
to
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
into
p
2
v
2
minus
p
1
v
1
and
that
is
equal
to
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
into
R
T
2
1
minus
T
1
R
T
2
minus
T
1.
So,
we
can
write
minus
W
1-2
is
equal
to
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
R
T
1
into
p
2
by
p
1
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
minus
1.
So,
we
can
write
that
minus
W
1-2,
as
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
R
T
1
into
p
2
over
p
1
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
minus
1
right.
So,
with
this
the
time
is
over,
we
leave
it
that
1
to
2
is
the
isentropic
compression,
and
their
work
done,
we
have
related
in
terms
of
p
v
that,
how
much
work
a
p
v
t
rather
how
much
work
is
done
on
the
system
that is minus right.
So, with this let us stop today .  Thank you.
