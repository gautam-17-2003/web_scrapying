The Carnot Cycle
Good
morning.
Hopefully ,
you
are
all
right
and
you
are
very
much
enthusiastic,
because,
we
are
almost,
not
almost,
a
little
less
than
half
of
the
total
course
work.
We
said
that,
this
is
a
cooling
technology ,
that
means,
we
will
first,
we
have
said,
why
we
need
cooling,
second
we
are
saying,
is
on
the
way
that,
how
to
produce
the
cooling?
and
third
part
will
be
application
of
the
cooling
right.
So,
all
three
put
together
is
the
cooling
technology
course.
Now ,
just
in
the
previous
class,
we
have
finished
psychrometrics,
and
hopefully ,
you
have
come
across
a
lot
of
problems,
and
hopefully
you
are
using
your
forum,
and
you
are
getting
the
answers
of
those.
However ,
now
we
go
to
the
real
cycles
of the refrigeration.
The
ideal
cycle
is
the
Carnot
cycle
right.
So
we
are
dealing
with
now
Carnot
cycle.
If
you
remember ,
we
had
told
you,
Carnot
heat
engine,
right.
So
from
there,
if
we
take
the
queue, that ideal thermodynamic cycles for Carnot.
There
are
four
reversible
processes,
and
this
is
independent
of
substance,
any
substance,
whether ,
it
is
vapour ,
liquid,
anything
will
have
the
same
effect
right
and
in
that,
we
have
two
isothermal,
and
two
adiabatic
processes
right.
In
this
figure,
we
have
given
that,
a
pictorial
view .
rather ,
of
the
four
processes,
and
these
four
processes
are:
isothermal
expansion,
that
is,
you
are
supplying
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
from
the
heat
reservoir
to,
this
is,
of
course,
the,
as
it
is
appearing,
that
it
is
a
reciprocating
kind
of
compressor ,
or
whatever
compressor ,
right
piston.
The
similar
one
which
you
use,
as
the,
during
holy,
period right.  So you have one washer and pump and then you blow .
So,
you
are
forcing
liquid
to
go
out.
It
is
not
that,
it
is,
whatever
is
inside,
that
is
being
compressed,
right
or
expanded,
the
first
one
is
isothermal
expansion.
The
second
one
is
adiabatic
expansion,
right
second
one
is
adiabatic
expansion.
So,
in
the
reversible
isothermal
expansion,
from
the
state
point
1
to
2,
under
constant
temperature,
T
H,
it
is
the
first
process.
The
second
process
is
reversible
adiabatic
expansion
between
2
to
3,
since
it
is
adiabatic
so
Q
is
0,
and
the
temperature
from
T
H
is
proceeding
towards
T
L
rather , T H is of  course, T high and T L is of course, T low right.Third
one
is
reversible
isothermal
compression,
and
it
is
between
3
to
4
and
the
temperature
T
L
is
constant.
Fourth
one
is
reversible
adiabatic
compression,
that
is
between
4
back
to
1.
So
all
processes,
are
reversible.
So,
under
this
equilibrium
sign,
it
is,
that
it
is
reversible
right.
So,
all
processes
are
reversible,
and
we
have
4
processes,
out
of which 2 are isothermal  and 2 are adiabatic processes right.
This,
we
have
shown
also
with
the
help
of
this
pictorial
view
right,
with
the
help
of
this
pictorial
view
we
have
shown.
Now ,
if
we
go
back
to
the
diagram,
then,
we
see
that
the
Carnot
cycle
in
a
PV
diagram
looks
like
this
right.
It
looks
like
this.
You
have,
sorry ,
you
have
this
point
1
to
point
2
where
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
being
supplied
at
a
temperature
of
T
H,
that
is
constant,
then
from
2
to
3,
it
is
T
H
is
coming
to
2
L,
this
is
not,
H,
it
was
current
phase,
mistake,
right,
where
it
is,
we
said,
2
isothermal,
and
2
adiabatic.
So
this
was
isothermal
expansion,
this
is
adiabatic
expansion,
this
is
isothermal compression,  and this is adiabatic compression, right back to 1.
So,
if
we
look
at
this,
over
again
PV
diagram,
then,
the
area,
we
said
the
earlier
also
that
if
you
remember ,
in
some
of
the
previous
classes,
we
said,
say
point
3
to
4
the
area
under
this
is
the
net.
So
that
concept
again
we
are
bringing
here
ok.
And
work
done
by
the
gas,
if
it
is
a
gas,
whatever
be
the
substance,
we
said,
see,
if
it
is
a
gas
then,
work
done
by
the
gas
is
integral
of
p
dV,
which
comes
under
the
area
1,
2,
3,
during
the
process,
right,
dV
is
greater
than
0.
So
we
get
p
dV
is
greater
than
0
and
this
is
the
area,
which
encompasses
process
1,
2,
2
to
3
right.
So
that
we
call
work
done
by
the
gas,
that
is,
integral
of
p
dV,
that
is
area
under
the
process
of
the
curve
1,
2,
3,
and
dV
being
greater
than 0, from 1, 2, 3 we can say integral  of p dV  is also greater than 0.
The
other
one,
back,
that
is
from
process
3
to
4
to
1,
right,
process
3
to
4
to
1,
that
we
can
say
that,
this
is
3,
this
is
4
and
this
is
1.
So,
work
done,
that
was
work
done
by
the
gas,
this
is
work
done
on
the
gas,
right,
and
that
is
also
integral
of
p
dV,
which
is
encompassing
the
area
under
the
process
curve
that
is
3,
4,
1
right.
Then,
it
is
dV
is
less
than
0.
So
p
dV
is
less
than
0.
Then,
by
subtracting
these
two,
that
is,
area
under
1,
2,
3
and
area
under
3,
4,
1,
if
we
subtract
then,
the
net
work
done,
that
can
be
written
as
this,
that is 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3  to 4 and 4 to 1, and this is the net area available, right.
We,
said
p
dV
is
for
1
to
3,
dV
being
greater
than
0,
is
positive,
greater
than
0,
and
process
3
to
4
to
1,
dV
is
less
than
0.
So,
p
dV
is
less
than
0
right.
So,
the
resultant
will
be
subtracting
this
to
that
and
that
comes
to
1,
2,
3,
4,
3,
4,
1,
that
area,
which
is
covered
under
this
in
the
p
V
diagram,
right.
So,
this
is
what
is
the
Carnot
cycle.
Now ,
if
we
analyze
it,
then,
here,
one
thing
is
that,
we
have
assumed
that,
all
the
processes
are
reversible right.All
the
processes
are
reversible,
that
we
have
assumed.
So,
if
we
analyze
this,
then
we
get
this
is
the
actual
process,
where
we
have
a
turbine,
we
have
one
pump,
we
have
one
boiler ,
and
we
have
one
condenser .
So,
boiler
is
supplying
the
heat,
that
is
Q
H
at
a
temperature
of
T
H,
then
it
is
from
point
1
to
point
2,
it
is
a
turbine,which
is
doing
the
work
and
coming
to
the
condenser
leaving
Q
C
quantity
of
heat,
at
the
constant
temperature
T
L,
and
then
it
is
going
to
the
pump,
on
which,
some
work
is
being
done,
and
it
is
going
back
to
the
point
4,
and
then
again
it
is
cycling
through
the
boiler
right.
So,
this
is
called
a
Carnot
cycle,
involving
two
phases,
that
is,
it
is
still
two
adiabatic
and
still two isothermal process right.  So, two adiabatic and two isothermal processes.
So,
if
we
look
at
the
P
V
diagram,
right
it
looks
like
this,
this
is
the
dome,
and
point
1
to
point
2,
point
2
to
point
3,
point
3
to
point
4,
and
back
to
point
1
right
this
is
under
P
V
diagram.
So,
it
is
always
reversible.
A
Carnot
cycle
is
reversible
by
its
definition.
So,
we
have
considered,
the
cycle
to
be
reversible,
because,
Carnot
cycle
is
always
reversible
by
definition.
Then,
if
we
look
at
the
Carnot
refrigeration
cycle,
for
a
gas,
it
is
the
reverse
of
that  of the Carnot heat engine right.
Here,
it
starts
from
point
1,
sorry ,
it
starts
from
point
1,
right
and
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
dissipated,
that
is
4.
So,
it
starts
from
point
1,
aonend
W
quantity
of
heat
whereas,
work
is
done
and
then
Q
L
quantity
of
heat
is
added
to
the
system
at
constant
temperature
of
T
L
and
again
some
work
is
done
by,
or
on
the
system,
reaches
to
the
point
4,
where,
at
a
constant
temperature
T
H,
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
rejected.
This
is
the
refrigeration
cycle,
for
Carnot
system,
and
earlier
it
was
the
heat
or
what
we
say
that
it
is,
that
was
a
heat
engine,
right.
So,
if
we
analyze,
we
can
say,
the
analytical
form
of
the
Carnot
statement
is
like
this,
that,
constant
that
conservation
of
energy
for
a
cycle,
this
says
that,
delta
E
is
0
that
is,
no
internal
energy,
and
is
equals
to
Q
cycle
minus
W
cycle.
If
that
be
true,
then
we
can
say,
that
Q
cycle
is
equal
to
W
cycle,
right
quantity
of
Q
supplied
to
a
cycle,
total
summation
of
total
Q
that
is
equal
to
summation
of
total
W
of
the
cycle
right.
So,
if
this
be
true,
then,
what
we
can
say,
we
have
not
limited
the
number
of
heat
reservoirs
or
work
interactions,
for
that
we
have
not
limited
to
number
of
heat
reservoirs
or
work
interactions.
Therefore,
Q
cycle
could
be
Q
H
minus
Q
C
right,
Q
cycle
could
be
Q
H
minus
Q
C
for
example,
this
is
what.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
the
analytical
form
of
the
K
P
statement,
if
you
remember ,
during
our
thermodynamic
class,
we
had
said
K
P
statement, and I repeatedly told that this will be using subsequently .
Î”
E = 0 = Q
cycle
- W
cycle
, or
Q
cycle
= W
cycleSo,
please
listen,
and
understand
it,
right.
So,
it
is
Kelvin
Planck
statement,
and
it
is
saying
that,
let
us
limit
ourselves
to
the
special
case
of
one
thermal
energy
reservoir ,
T
E
R.
So,
if
you
have
one
thermal
energy
reservoir ,
like
this,
then
if
Q,
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
a
heat
exchanger ,
this
is
that,
heat
exchanger ,
then
W
quantity
of
heat
work
will
be
done
by
the
system
because
you
are
supplying
Q.
So,
the
energy
of
the
heat
exchanger
is
increasing,
so,
it
will
do
some
work.
So,
it
is
done
by
the
system,
if
it
is
a
single
reservoir ,
as
a
special
case,
if
we
limit
to
that,
and
W
quantity
of
heat,
rather
W
quantity
of
work
will
be
done.
Now ,
if
we
look
at
again,
the
Kelvin
Planck
statement,
that,
however ,
it
would
not
violate
the
K
P
statement,
if
work
were
done
on
the
system,
during
the
cycle,
or,
if
work
were
0.
That
means,
W
cycle
can
be
less
than,
or
equal
to,
if
it
is
work
done
on
the
system
or
it
could
be
equal
to
0,
then,
W
cycle
is
less
than
equal
to
0, and this is for a single reservoir .
So,
Q
cycle,
then,
would
be
less
than
equal
to
0.
Again,
for
a
single
reservoir .
So,
these
are
known
as
analytical
forms
of
the
K
P
statement,
and
if
we
analyze
further ,
this
is
for
single
reservoir
right.
If
we
analyze
further ,
with
say,
the
K
P
statement
analytical
form
which
can
be
said
like
this
that
both
the
equations
may
be
regarded
as
analytical
form
of
the
K
P
statement,
which
are
the
equations,
this
that,
W
cycle
is
less
than
equal
to
0,
or
Q
cycle
is
also
less
than
equal
to
0.
So,
both,
these
may
be
regarded
as
the
analytical
forms of the K P  statement.
It
can
be
also
shown
that
the
equality
applies
to
only
reversible
processes.
Less
than,
could
be
the
irreversible,
but,
the
equality
is
applied
to
the
reversible
processes,
and
the
inequality
applies
to
irreversible
processes,
then
which,
we
consider
a
cycle,
for
which,
the
equality ,
applies,
then,
we
can
say,
that,
sorry ,
you
can
say
that
Q
cycle
is
equal
to
W
cycle,
right,
Q
cycle
is
equal
to
W
cycle
then,
Carnot
fast
corollary ,
we
can
write
the
thermal
efficiency
of
an
irreversible
power
cycle
is
always
less
than
the
thermal
efficiency
of
a
reversible
power
cycle,
when
each
operates
between
the
same
two
reservoirs
right.
The
thermal
efficiency ,
we
repeat,
the
thermal
efficiency
of
an
irreversible
power
cycle
is
always
less
than
the
thermal
efficiency
of
a
reversible
power
cycle,
when
each
operates
between
the
same
two
reservoirs
right.
So,
what
we
can,
we
have
said
that,
the
thermal
efficiency
of
reversible
power
cycle,
when
it
operates
between
the
same
two
reservoirs,
is
always
less
than
the
thermal
efficiency
of,
if
it
is
a
reversible,
then
the
irreversible
one
is
always
less
than
the
reversible
one.
So,
here
we
show
that,
we
have
one
reservoir
like
this,
and
hot
reservoir ,
and
another
is
cold
reservoir
right,
but,
both
the
reservoirs,
under
which,
the
two
engines
are
working,
one
is
reversible and the other one is irreversible.
Q
C
=Q
H
-W
R
;   Q
C
â€™
=Q
H
-W
I
;
If
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied
to
the
reversible
one,
then,
W
R
quantity
of
work
will
be
available,
then
the
Q
C
quantity ,
which
is
rejected,
can
be
written
as
Q
C
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W
R
right.
Q
C
is
that
left
over,
where
W
R
was
done,
and
Q
H
was
supplied,
right.
So,
Q
C
is
Q
H
minus
W
R
right.
Then,
we
can
say
for
the
same
irreversible
one,
the
same
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
supplied,
sorry ,
is
supplied
and
same
W
I
quantity
of
work
is
done,
then
the
quantity
of
heat
that
is
Q
dot
C,
which
is
rejected
is
Q
H
minus
W
I, right.
So,
it
is
Q
H
minus
W
I.
So,
we
are
operating
in
the
same
heat
reservoir ,
one
reversible
and
another
irreversible
engines,
and
the
same
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
applied
to
both
the
engines,
R
and
I,
that
is
reversible
and
irreversible,
and
in
one
case
W
R
quantity
of
heat
work
is
done
by
the
reversible
one
and
it
is
rejecting
Q
C
quantity
of
heat
equivalent
to
Q
H
minus
W
R
right.
Whereas,
for
the
irreversible
one,
this
Q
H
quantity
of
heat
is
being
supplied
and
W
I
quantity
of
work
is
obtained,
or
is
being
done,
the
quantity
of
heat,
which
is
rejected
is
Q
C
dot
and
which
is
equal
to
Q
H
minus
W
I,
right.
So,
perhaps,
today ,
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
time.
So,
we
will
do
it
next
time,
next
day. So, till that time you please  take care and do practice. Thank you.
