Basics of Thermodynamics Contd.
Good
morning
my
students.
In
the
previous
class,
if
you
remember ,
at
the
end
of
the
class,
we
were
giving
you
lot
of
relations,
which
are
basically
non-dimensional,
and
used
both
heat
transfer
and
mass
transfer .
And
as
I
told
you
also
there
that
in
this
basics
of
thermodynamics
continuation
class,
some
relations,
I
will
be
providing
you,
which
are
very
very
helpful.
And
as
and
when
you
come
across
you
will
be
utilizing
it
more,
say
it
becomes
a
ready
reference
right.
So,
some
more
relations
are
like
this
that
Lewis
number ,
this
is
L
e
that
is
alpha
over
d
that
is,
ratio
of
mass
diffusivity
and
thermal
diffusivity ,
right
ratio
of
mass
diffusivity
and
thermal
diffusivity ,
Lewis
number
alpha
is
the
thermal
diffusivity
and
d
is
the
mass
diffusivity
right.
L,
a
number
that
is
R
a
this
is
shown as g beta delta L  L cube over V a right.
This
of
course,
as
a
very
elongated
definition
that
this
is
associated
with
buoyancy
driven
flow
also
known
as
free
convection
in
natural
convection,
if
be
below
the
critical
value
not
that
fluid
heat
transfer
is
primarily
in
the
form
of
conduction
and
it
exceeds
the
critical
value,
heat
transfer
is
primarily
in
the
form
of
convection.
So,
depending
on
whether
it
is
convective
heat
transfer ,
or
conductive
heat
transfer
this
Rayleigh
number
gives
a
very
very
good
idea
right.
Similarly ,
some
other
numbers,
like
Stanton
number ,
S
t
this
is
of
course,
ratio
of
two
non
dimensional
numbers,
that
is
N
u
over
R
e
in
into
P
r,
N
u
over
R
e
over
P
r
right.
So,
this
can
be
that
is
N
u
is
Nusselt
number ,
R
e
is
the
Reynolds
number ,
as
of
now
we
have
seen
and
P
r
is
the
Prandtl
number ,
and
this
can
be
said that this is the ratio of heat  transfer into a fluid to the thermal capacity of fluid right.
Rayleigh
number ,
another
very
important
P
e
and
of
course,
this
is
a
product
of
two
non
dimensional
parameters,
and
that
is
R
e
into
P
r.
Obviously ,
as
we
have
used
earlier ,
R
e
is
the
Reynolds
number
and
P
r
is
the
Prandtl
number .
So,
this
can
be
said,
as
ratio
of
the
rate
of
advection
of
a
physical
quantity
to
physical
quantity
by
the
flow
to
the
rate
of
diffusion
of
the
same
quantity
driven
by
an
appropriate
gradient.
Now ,
another
very
misleading
very
misleading,
non
dimensional
number
is
Biot
number
B
i,
B
i
is
known
as
Biot
number
or
Biot
number
whatever ,
you
call
it,
is
B
i
o
t.
It
is
defined,
as
h
d
by
k,
if
you
remember ,
in
the
previous
class
we
said
Nusselt
number ,
N
u
that
was
also
h
d
by
k
and
this
is
also
h
d
by
k
then
what
is
the
difference?
Obviously ,
there
is
a
difference,otherwise,
they
would
not
have
been
the
same
number
right
in
the
Nusselt
number
where
we said it was h d by k there, d in both the cases are diameter .
There
h
was
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
of
the
convective
medium,
and
k
was
also
the
conductivity ,
of
the
convective
medium.
All
the
properties
were,
with
the
heat
transfer ,
from
where,
medium
it
is
coming
to
the
product
or
base
whatever ,
but
here
it
is
coming
into
the
body .
So,
h
is
the
outside
heat
transfer
coefficient,
d
is
the
diameter
of
the
matter
and
k
is
the
conductivity
of
the
material.
So,
h
d
by
k
for
this
and
h
d
by
k
for
Nusselt
number
are
absolutely
different
and
this
difference
is
in
the
thermal
conductivity
k
one
is
of
the
medium
or
fluid
another
is
of
the
body
through
which
the
heat
is
getting
transferred.
And
this
is
defined
as
the
ratio
of
internal
conduction
resistance
and
surface
convective  resistance to heat transfer .
You
will
see,
if
you
have
done
heat
transfer
that,
this
Biot
number
is
very
very
helpful
in
Hessler
chart.
Of
course,
we
cannot
bring
it
here,
because
that
becomes
really
more,
beyond
the
purview
of
the
course,
as
such
these,
are
also,
but
since
all
of
you
are
our
student.
So,
more
information
you
have
it
is
better
off.
Then
Fourier
number ,
again
this
is
very
much
useful
in
heat
transfer
typically
useful
in
Hessler
chart,
using
the
chart
beard
number ,
Fourier
number
these
are
very
much
and
non-dimensional
temperature,
they
are
used
in
the
chart
of
Hessler
to
find
out
the
temperatures
from
non-dimensional
temperature.
So,
it
is
defined
as
ratio
of
the
heat
conduction
rate
to
the
rate
of
thermal
energy
storage
ratio
of
the
heat
conduction
rate
to
the
rate
of
thermal
energy
storage
alpha T by L  square  right.
Another
thing
since
it
has
come,
let
me
also
tell
that
this,
L
is
the
half
of
the
length
right
if
the
thickness
is
say
2
L,
then
half
is
the
L,
and
that
is
used
right.
So,
you
have
to
be
careful,
using
that
L,
which
one
the
entire
L,
or
L
by
2
or
normally
it
is,
if
it
is
a
symmetric
body ,
is
written
plus
minus
L,
right.
So,
that
part
you
have
to
be
careful.
Now
there
are
certain
relations
for
heat
transfer
to
find
out
the
heat
transfer
coefficient
inside
the
tube
and
many
other
cases.
Obviously ,
for
different
conditions,
it
will
be
different,
like
if
the
flow
is
laminar
then
Nusselt-Grace
correlation
says
that
with
parabolic
velocity profile and constant wall temperature.
The
relation
is
valid
for
thermal
entrance
length
having
parabolic
velocity
profile
and
constant
wall
temperature.
So,
in
that
case
Nusselt
number ,
x,
Nu
x,
means
at
any
position
x,
is
given
as
1.007
into
peclet
number
into
Di
that
is
internal
diameter
over
x
to
the
power
1
by
3,
right
and
this
is
valid
for
peclet
into
internal
diameter
over
x
equal
to
or greater than 10 to the power 2.  And, is equal to 3.
66.
If
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter
over
x
is
less
than
10
to
the
power
2,
right.So,
another
relation
for
this
is
Nu
x,
that
is
Nusselt
number
at
any
position
x,
is
1.61
into
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter
Di
over
L,
L,
obviously ,
is
the
length
to
the
power
1
by
3,
that
is
valid
for
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter
over
L
and
if
it
is
greater
than
10
to
the
power
2,
and
is
equal
to
3.66,
if
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter
over
L
is
less
than
10
to
the
power
2.
Obviously ,
the
peclet
number ,
Pe,
that
is
equal
to
Reynold's
number into Prandtl number right.
So,
this
is
meaning,
rho
into
D
into
V
by
mu
into
Cp
into
mu
by
k
right.
So,
it
becomes
rho
Cp
V
D
by
k
because
mu
cancels
out.
Now ,
other
relations,
like
Herson's
correlation,
this
is
valid
for
developing
hydrodynamic
and
thermal
boundary
layer
and
for
constant
wall temperature.  This is saying that Nusselt number average is equal to 3.
66
plus
0.0668
into
internal
diameter
Di
over
L
length
into
peclet
number ,
Pe
over
1
plus
0.04
into
Di
over
L
into
peclet
number
to
the
power
2
by
3.
And
another
relation
could
be
Nusselt
number
average,
equal
to
3.66
plus
0.19
into
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter over L  to the power 0.
5
sorry
0.8
over
1
plus
0.0117
into
the
initial
diameter
Di
over
length
L
into
peclet
number
to
the
power
0.467.
Some
relations
are
very
useful
and
mostly
it
is
used.
One
of
them is Sieder -Tate equation or Sieder -Tate correlation.
This
is
very
useful
for
pipe
flow
in
terms
of
heat
transfer
and
this
is
valid
for
constant
wall
temperature
where,
mu
W
is
the
viscosity
at
the
wall
temperature.
If
obviously ,
the
wall
temperature
is
changing
the
viscosity
is
also
changing
that
is
why
it
is
valid
for
constant
wall
temperature
for
which
the
viscosity
mu
W
that
becomes
also
constant.
Now ,
Nud
based
on
diameter
average,
is
equal
to
Nud
equal
to
1.86
into
peclet
number
to
the
power
1.3
into
Di
over
L
to
the
power
1
by
3
peclet
number
to
the
power
1
by
3
not
peclet number , is also to the power 1.
3
and
the
this
is
called
non
dimensional
length
Di
over
L,
that
it
is
also
to
the
power
1
by
3
into
the
viscosity
correction
that
is
mu
by
mu
W
to
the
power
0.14.
This
tells
that
if
there
be
any
viscosity
correction,
because
wall
will
have
either
higher
or
lower
temperature
than
the
inside.
So,
if
you
take
the
viscosity
inside
one
then
for
the
wall
there
will
be
some
other
temperature
than
the
core
temperature.
So,
there,
the
viscosity
correction factor is introduced and that is mu by mu W to the  power 0.
14.
Another
one
is
also
very
much
used,
that
is
called
slender
correlation.
This
is
also
valid
for
constant
wall
temperature
and
the
relation
is
Nusselt
number
averaging
equal
to
3.66
to
the
power
3
plus
1.61
to
the
power
3
times
peclet
into
individual
or
the
internal
diameter
over
length
to
the
power
1
by
3.
So,
that
is
another
relation,
but
again
valid
forconstant wall temperature.
For
constant
heat
flux,
I
hope
flux
you
know .
In
the
earlier
class,
I
had
said
flux.
Flux
means,
anything
or
any
parameter
per
unit
time
per
unit
area
is
the
flux
of
that.
If
it
is
for
flow of fluid it is called momentum flux.  If it is for heat transfer it is called heat flux.
If
it
is
for
mass
transfer ,
it
is
also
there
used
as
mass
transfer
flux
right.
So,
that
flux
you
have
to
use
as
the
parameter
per
unit
time
per
unit
area.
So,
Nusselt
number
is
1.302
into
peclet
number
into
d
i
that
is
diameter
of
the
internal
pipe
over
x,
at
any
point
to
the
power
1
by
3
where,
peclet
number
into
initial
diameter
d
over
x
is
greater
than
10
to
the
power
4
whereas,
Nusselt
number
again
based
on
the
diameter
d
is
4.36,
if
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter
d
i
over
x
is
less
than
10
to
the
power
3,
whereas,
Nusselt
number
is 1.
953
into
peclet
number
into
d
i,
that
is
initial
diameter
of
the
system
over
x
to
the
power
1
by
3
and
is
valid
for
peclet
into
d
initial
over
x
and
that
should
be
greater
than
10
to
the
power
2.
For
10
to
the
power
less
than
10
to
the
power
2
the
other
relation
is
4.36
where
peclet
number
into
internal
diameter
d
over
x
is
less
than
10
to
the
power
2.
Now ,
some
more
relations
are
like,
if
it
is
a
annular
passage
right.
So,
you
see
this
can
be
said
annular passage, that this arc, you can see and this arc, you  can see.
So,
if
they
are
2,
then
this
internal
is
called
annular
passage,right
and
there
Stefan's
correlation
based
upon
the
results
of
housen
is
like
this,
d
h
is
equal
to
d
o
minus
d
r
into
Reynolds
number
is
equal
to
u
d
h
over
v
and
Nusselt
number
is
h
d
h
over
T
a.
And
for
that,
we
can
write
Nusselt
number ,
equal
to
Nusselt
number
as
a
function
of
d
i
over
d
o
times,
or
it
can
be
said
that
not
function
it
can
be
also
said
integral
or
cyclic
integral
is
0.19
peclet
number
into
d
i
that
is
initial
diameter
over
L
to
the
power
0.8
by
1
plus
0.117 into peclet number into d i initial diameter  over L  to the power 0.
667
0.467
rather .
Hence,
if
0.1
is
less
than
Prandtl
number
is
less
than
10
to
the
power
3,
0,
d
initial
over
d
o
outside
is
less
than
1
and
Re
is
also
less
than
2300,
then
Nusselt
number
equal
to
3.66
plus
1.2
into
d
i
over
d
o
to
the
power
0.5.
This
is
case
1
for
outer
wall of annulus is considered if you are and Nusselt number is  3 into 1.
2
into
d
into
d
o
to
the
power
0.5.
Then,
it
becomes
case
2
and
inner
wall
of
annulus
is
insulated.
The
third
one
is
Nusselt
number
is
3.66
into
or
rather
plus
4
into
0.102
over
d
i
over
d
a
or

Now ,
for
turbulent
flow
the
most
common
use
is
deters
voltage
equation
in
heat
transfer .
So,
it
is
valid
for
fully
developed
turbulent
flow
and
the
properties
are
evaluated
at
the
bulk
temperature.
Now ,
the
basic
equation
is
N
u
is
equal
to
0.023
into
Reynolds
number
to
the
power
0.8
into
Prandtl's
number
to
the
power
N
and this is valid for Prandtl number 0.
6
to
100.
For
heating
N
is
0.4
and
for
cooling
N
is
0.3
and
the
Nusselt
number
is
h
d
i
over
k
into
Reynolds
and
Reynolds
number
is
equals
to
rho
d
v
i
by
into
v
by
mu
and
Prandtl
number
is
C
p
mu
by
k.
So,
if
all
are
known
then
deters
voltage
equation
is
very
very
in
full
for
turbulent
flow.
Sider -Tate
correlation
could
be
written
as
variation
of
viscosity with temperature is  included.
Nusselt
number
is
0.036
into
Reynolds
number
to
the
power
0.8
into
Prandtl
number
to
the
power

by

into
mu
by
mu
w
to
the
power
0.14,
where
mu
w
is
the
viscosity
of
the
wall
temperature.
This
means
that
viscosity
is
also
a
function
viscosity
is
also
calculated
at
the
wall
right.
So,
this
is
the
last
perhaps
that
Nusselt
coordination
is
like
N
u
equal
to
0.

I

this

So,
with
this
let
us
stop
today
and
hopefully
we
have
completed
the
basics
of
thermodynamics
including
all
these
relations.
Some
more,
many
relations
are
there,
but
obviously ,
I
do
not
want
to
make
you
or
give
so
much
pressure
on
it,
because
there
are
many
other
things,
but
these
are
very
helpful
relations,
mind
it,
ok.
So,
thank
you
very
much.
