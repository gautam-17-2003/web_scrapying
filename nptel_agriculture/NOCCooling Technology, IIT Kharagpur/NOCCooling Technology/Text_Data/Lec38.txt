Gas as Refrigerant(Contd.)
Good
afternoon,
my
dear
boys
and
girls
and
friends.
In
the
previous
class,
we
had
started
with
gas
as
the
refrigerant,
right
and
there,
I
asked
you
one
thing,
which,
you,
I
have
no
idea,
because,
we
are
not
corresponding
directly .
Whether ,
you
could
recognize
that
or
not,
that
V
1
square
plus
p
2
by
rho
that
is,
the
velocity
head,
plus
pressure
head,
plus
the
gravitational
head
is
constant.
This
equation,
we
had
utilized,
and
I
asked
you
to
remember ,
or
chance,
I
had
taken
that,
whether ,
you
can
remember
that
or
not.
Hopefully ,
you
have,
but,
for
those,
who
could
not
have,
that
was
the
Bernoulli's
equation,
right,
that
velocity
head,
plus
pressure
head,
plus
gravitational
head,
plus
any
other
forces,
some
of
them
is
equal
to
0
at
steady
state
right.
If
it
is
not
of
course,
steady
state, then it will not be equal to 0.
It
is
under
steady
state,
that
is
why,
V
1
square
by
2
and
that
side
V
2
square
by
2
you
can
write,
at
two
points,
right.
So,
that
was
Bernoulli's
equation.
I
asked
you
of
course,
I
cannot
get
back
from
you
because
we
are
not
in
direct
contact.
So,
I
hope,
you
could
have figured it out and for those, who could not, it is Bernoulli's equation, ok.
Now ,
we
had
stopped
in
the
previous
class,
the
continuation
of
this,
gas
as
refrigerant,
up
to
the
first
step,
1
to
2
right.
Usually ,
by
this
time,
these
steps
are
in
your
mind
right.
So,
one
like
this
1
2
3
4
back
to
1,
this
is
what
is
our
system,
right.
Again,
say,
from
this
end,
I
start
1
2
3
4
back
to
1,
this
is
in
our
system.
So,
we
have
done
1
to
2
and
that
was
isentropic, right.
Process 2 -3 Isothermal heat r ejection
:
Now ,
let
us
look
at
the
other
one,
that
is,
that
is,
isothermal.
To
keep
it
in
our
mind,
I
always
try
to
put
back
the
system
before
your
eye.
So,
it
was
T
S,
and
this
was
the
dome,
this was point 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 back to point 1, right.
So,
1
2
3
4,
so,
2
isentropic,
and
2
isothermal,
right.
So,
this
was
our
system.
Now ,
we
are
coming
to
the
point.
We
come
back
to
2
to
3,
and
during
this
process,
pressure
increases,
and
hence,
work
has
to
be
done
on
the
system,
and
for
the
isothermal
process,
right.
So,
1
2
3
4
back
to
1,
right
1
2
3
4
ok.
So,
from
this
was
pressure
Pe
from
this
was
pressure Pc.
So,
Pc
is
much
much
greater
than
Pe.
So
the
one
which
we
are
saying
that
during
this
process
pressure
increases.
Hence,
work
has
to
be
done
on
the
system,
and
this
is
the
system,
which
the
process
is
isothermal.
So,
in
that
case,
we
can
say,
P1
V1
is
equal
to
P2
V2
right.
If
it
is
adiabatic,
then,
we
say,
P
V
gamma
is
constant,
but,
if
it
is
isothermal
it
is
P1
V1
is
equal
to
P2
V2
and
that
is,
P
V
is
constant,
right.
So,
we
can
write
that,
P1
V1 is P2 V2 is equal to R T2, right R T1 or equal to R T2.
So,
the
flow
of
work
for
the
open
system,
that
we
can
write
as,
that
we
can
write
as,
minus
W
2
to
3
integral
of
2
to
3,
pdV,
right.
Since
p
is
increasing
so,
we
can
write
minus
RT2
between
2
to
3,
this
V,
we
can
replace
with
1
by
rho,
or
this
is
P
1
by
rho,
right.
So,
it
is
RT2
no,
no,
sorry ,
sorry ,
sorry ,
it
is
P
rho.
So,
P1
V1
is
P1
V1
is
P2
V2
is
equal
to
RT2.
So,
minus
W
2
to
3,
between
2
to
3,
Vdp
is
minus
RT2,
2
to
3,
this
is
dP
over P , because this PV  is RT2 so, there it comes in, and we are writing dP  over P  right.
And
this
is
RT2,
since
1
by
P,
dP
of
1
by
P
is
ln
P3
over
P2
ok.
So,
so,
minus
W
2
to
3
is
Vdp
between
2
to
3
is
equal
to
minus
RT2
between
2
to
3
dP
over
P.
So,
ln
P,
that
is,
ln
P3
over
P2,
that
is
fine.
Only ,
I
have
a
little
hangover
over
this
negative
sign,
this
negative
sign,
where
did
it
go?
This
is
P3
over
P2
ok,
W
2
to
3
is
minus
RT2
ln
P3
over
P2,
that
is
what.
We
had
missed
1
minus,
that
was,
by
chance,
right,
Here
also,
it
should
have
been
minus
RT2
ln
P3
over
P2.
Otherwise,
where
this
minus
is
going?
So,
I
got
stuck there ok.
So,
we
can
now
say
that
since,
again,
this
was
2
to
3
right,
this
was
2
and
this
was
3.
And
both
are
under
same
temperature,
that
is
T2.
So,
T2
and
T3
are
same,
right,
because,
that
is
isothermal.
So,
we
can
write
for
T2
is
equal
to
T3,
and
for
a
perfect
gas,
we
can
also
write
h2
is
equal
to
h3.
So,
using
that
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
for
steady
flow
system with delta KE and delta PE equal to 0.
So,
we
get
Q
2
to
3
is
W
2
to
3,
right
Q
2
to
3
is
W
2
to
3
because
no
internal
energy
is
there.
So,
we
can
say
now
that
Q
2
to
3
is
equal
to
W
2
to
3
is
equal
to
minus
RT2
ln
P3
over
P2.
So,
here,
there
was
a
negative,
which
was
omitted,
right,
because
of
cut
and
paste,
ok.
So,
I
was
searching
it,
where
it
is,
how
could
it
be?
So,
this
is
minus
RT2
lnP3
over
P2,
right,
that
negative
sign
indicates
that,
the
work
is
done
on
the
system
and
heat is rejected by the system.
Δ
KE = 0 and 
Δ
PE = 0, we get q
2-3
= W
2-3
Work
is
done
on
the
system,
and
heat
is
rejected
by
the
system,
this
was
2
to
3.
So,
from
where
QC
was
rejected,
or
QH,
rather ,
was
rejected
at
constant
temperature
TH,
right.
This
you
remember .
So,
we
can
now
say
that
for,
similar
to
1
to
2
process,
we
can
write
that
S3
is
equal
to
S4,
and
Q3-4
is
equal
to
0,
right.
S3
is
equal
to
S4,
and
Q3-4
is
equal
to
0,
which
one
is
that,
this
was
3
and
this
was
4,
and
this
is
isentropic
in
TS
diagram,
right.
So,
this
being
isentropic
in
TS
diagram,
we
can
write
that
S2
is
equal
to,
no,
S3
is
equal
to
S4,
and
Q3-4
is
equal
to
0.
Now ,
again,
here,
applying
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics,
we
can
write
that.
Thus,
for
a
steady
flow,
we
can
write,
minus
W3
to
4
is equal to h4 minus h3, right or h3 minus h4 is equal to Cp T3 minus T4, right.
process 1 – 2, we can write, s
3
= s
4
and q
3-4
= 0
So,
for
open
system,
the
same
result
can
be
found
out,
that,
the
flow
of
work
for
isentropic
process
is
PV
gamma
or
P3
V3
gamma
is
equal
to
P4
V4
gamma
right.
So,
this
is
true.
Therefore,
we
can
write
this,
minus
W3-4
is
integral
of
3
to
4
V
dp,
is
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
into
P4
V4
minus
P3
V3,
right,
is
equal
to
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
into
R
T4
minus
T3.
Therefore,
we
can
write
W3-4
is
equal
to
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
into
R
T4
into
P3
by
P4
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
minus
1,
right.
This
is
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
R
T4
P3
is
to
P4
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
minus
1.
Now ,
can
you
identify ,
there
is
a
mistake
again,
that
sign
mistake
is
there.
Can
you
identify?
Here
we
said
gamma
by
gamma,
sorry ,
here
we
said
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1
V
dp,
3
to
4
and
P4
V4
that
is
upper
limit
and
this
is
3,
P3
V3,
fine,
and
this
is
related to gamma by gamma  minus 1 R T4 minus T3, right and T4 and T3 are dif ferent.
Now ,
converting
it
into
P.
From
this
relation,
we
write
W3
to
4
is
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1,
is
R
T4
into,
R
T4
is
taken
out,
into
P3
over
P4.
It
was
P4
over
P3,
right.
It
was
P4
over
P3.
Here
also,
you
see
that,
this
is
P4
over
P3,
that
is
P4
V4
minus
P3
V3.
So,
where
from
suddenly ,
this,
no,
this
has
come,
because,
this
gamma
by
gamma
minus
1,
here
it
is
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
minus
1,
right.
So,
this
sign
has
been
taken
in
with
P3
over
P4.
So
that
you
please
check.
I
will
also
check
right,
you
please
check.
I
will
also
check
that
whether
this
is,
this
is
correct,
this
is
the
final,
but,
intermediate,
this
one
with
the
symbol
negative.
We
will
check
up
ok.
So
it
is
observed
that
W1
to
2
is
equal
to
and
opposite
to
W3
to
4
right.
It
is,
that
is,
W1
to
2
is
equal,
but
opposite
to
W3
to
4
right.
So,
if
W1
to
2
is
working
like
this,
then,
W3
to
4
is
working
like
this,
that
is
opposite, because of the sign right.
So,
we
can
now
say
that,
we
can
now
say
that,
the
last
process,
that
is
process
4
to
1
being
isothermal,
heat
rejection,
or
heat
absorption,
in
this
case
isothermal
heat
absorption.
There,
the
process
pressure
decreases
and
hence,
work
is
done
by
the
system.
We
had
pressure
Pc,
now,
we
have
come
to
pressure
Pe.
So,
Pc
is
much
greater
than
Pe,
so,
the
pressure
has
come
down.
So,
the
work
has
been
done
by
the
system,
right,
for
the
isothermal
process,
and
in
that
case,
we
can
say
that
P4
V4
is
equal
to
P1
V1
is
equal
to
RT1
because,
it
is
isothermal
right.
So,
it
being
isothermal,
P4
V4
is
P1
V1
is
equal
to
RT1.
Therefore,
flow
work
for
the
open
system
is,
that
can
be
said
that,
minus
W4
to
1
is
equal
to
integral
of
4
to
1
V
dp,
and
that
is
equal
to
minus
RT1,
4
to
1
dp
over
P,
and
this
is minus R T1 ln of P1 over P4.  So, here we have written the sign correctly right.
It is observed that W
1-2
is equal and opposite to
W
3-4
Process 4 – 1 Isothermal heat absorption:
Therefore,
W4
to
1,
that
can
be
written
as,
this
negative,
and
this
negative
goes
out,
RT1
ln
of
P4
is
to
P1,
no,
sorry ,
this
negative
sign
is,
and
this
negative
sign
are
different,
and
that
is,
that
is
why
this
minus
RT1
ln
of
P1
over
P4.
This
negative
sign
is
taken
inside,
and
that
becomes
RT1
of
ln
P4
is
to
P1,
right.
So,
instead
of
here,
P1
is
to
P4,
it
is
ln
P4
is
to
P1.
This
negative
sign
has
been
taken,
and
W4
to
1
also,
for
it,
T1
is
equal
to
T4,
there
is
no
ambiguity ,
this
was
T4,
this
was
T1,
right.
So,
T1
is
equal
to
T4,
and
hence
for
a
perfect
gas
also
we
can
write
h1
is
equal
to
h4.
So,
using
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
for
a
steady
flow
system,
where
delta
KE
and
delta
PE
are
0,
we
get
Q4
to 1 is equal to W4 to 1, right. So, Q4 to 1 is equal to W4  to 1.
also,
for
it,
T
1
=
T
4
,
and
hence,
for
a
perfect
gas,
h
1
=
h
4
.
Using
first
law
of
thermodynamics for a steady flow system with 
Δ
KE = 0 and 
Δ
PE = 0, we get q
4-1
= W
4-1
So,
there
are
two
ways
to
find
the
net
work,
and
COP,
the
first
thing,
first
method,
can
be
like
this.
Since
T2
over
T1
is
P2
over
P1
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma
is
equal
to
T3
over
T4
is
equal
to
P3
over
P4
to
the
power
gamma
minus
1
by
gamma.
So,
applying
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
to
the
whole
system
and
hence
we
can
write
that
P2
over,
we
can
write
P2
over
P1
is
P3
over
P4.
Therefore,
W
net
can
be
written
as
Q2
to
3
minus
Q4
to
1,
which,
we
have
shown
as
RT2
ln
P3
over
P2
minus
RT1
ln
P4
over
P1.
So,
we
can
write
mod
of
W
net
is
equal
to
RT2
minus
T1
ln
P4
over
P1
right.
Therefore,
COP
can
be
written
as
Q4
to
1
over
W
net
and
that
is
RT1
ln
of
P4
over
P1
by
RT2
minus
T1
ln
of
P4
over
P1
and
this
is
nothing,
but,
T1.
This
T1
over
T2
minus
T1,
this T2 minus T1, all other are cancelling out.
That
ln
of
P4
over
P1
and
ln
of
P4
over
P1,
we
have
already
shown
that
here
P2
is
to
P1
is
P3
is
to
P4
right.
That
means,
P4
over
P1
is
P2
over
P3,
right,
and
that
we
have
used
here.
So,
we
can
say,
P4
is
to
P1
is
P3
is
to
P2.
P4
is
to
P1
is
P3
is
to
P2,
right
and
that
is
how
we
have
written
here,
this
and
that,
and
ultimately ,
we
got
T1
by
T2
minus
T1
right.
So,
COP,
we
got
equal
to
T1
over
T2
minus
T1,
right.
Then
we
can
conclude
it
before
saying
thank
you,
we
can
conclude
it
that
for
a
gas
as
refrigerant,
COP
is
also
coming,
the
same
as
T
lower
over
T
higher
minus
T
lower ,
right
and
this
we
have
proved
with
the
help
of
first
law,
second
law
and
normal
thermodynamic
equations
including,
as
we
said
earlier
that,
we
started
with
the
equation
which
I
said
in
the
beginning
that
pressure
rate
plus
velocity
head
plus
the
gravitational
rate
plus
any
frictional
loss
is
equal
to
0,
which
was Bernoulli's equation right.
We
had
done
with
that
and
in
very
very
few
classes
we
could
come
to
the
thank
you
slide
because
either
the
class
got
continued
to
the
next
class
or
the
thank
you
for
which
may
be
the
thank
you
slide
was
at
the
end.
But
fortunately ,
this
class
we
could
have
finished
where
it
was
the
last
slide
and
that
is
thank
you
and
this
is
the
one
which
our
NPTEL
system
in
all
the
classes,
everywhere,
you
will
find,
if
you
come
across
with
the
thank
you
slide.
So,
thank
you
all
for
listening
and
I
wish
you
that
you
study
as
much
as
you
can ok. Thank you so much.
