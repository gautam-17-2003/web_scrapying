Crystallization
in
Fr eezing
Good
afternoon,
my
dear
students
and
dear
friends.
W e
have
started
application
of
cooling
and
in
that
we
have
started
with
freezing
and
we
have
shown
that
the
temperature
is
not
culprit
for
any
change
in
quality .
It
is
the
transformation
of
water
to
ice
that
is
the
culprit
if
there
be
any
change
in
quality
right.
So,
today
we
come
to
that
crystallization
in
freezing
and
how
it
is
af fecting
the
food
material
right.
So,
today's
class
we
are
doing
crystallization
in
freezing
and
for
that,
we
said
that
suspended
matter
or
cellular
components
are
unable
to
migrate
and
ice
crystals
either
form
around
them
and
push
them
aside.
Hence,
in
food
materials,
where
it
is
having
high
moisture,
normally
food
materials
do
have
high
moisture
of
say
80
percent,
90
percent,
95
percent,
depending
on
the
material
or
product
right.
So,
the
rate
of
ice
crystal
growth
is
generally
not
limited
by
any
mass
transfer
process,
except
during
the
late
stage
of
freezing,
when
temperature
is
very
low ,
and
the
viscosity
is
also
very
high,
and
unfrozen
water
is
also
very
small,
or
very
low .
Hence,
heat
transfer
limits
the
rate
of
crystallization,
because
of
lar ge
latent
heat
of
crystallization
of
water
and
growth
rate
is
increased
greatly ,
and
with
increase
of
heat
removal,
right.
Then,
we
are
lowering
down
the
temperature,
and
it
is
forming
some
ice
crystal,
right.
What
is
the
ef fect
will
come
afterwards,
but,
since
it
is
forming
some
ice
crystals,
then
the
rate
of
formation
of
ice
crystals
is
to
be
defined.
So,
let
us
then
define,
and
that
process
is
that
formation
of
ice
crystal
process,
is
known
as
freezing
of
water
to
ice,
right.
So,
this
transformation
rate,
we
can
say ,
it
is
slow
freezing,
if
the
rate
is
1
degree
centigrade
to
10
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
it
could
be
said
commercial
freezing,
if
the
rate
is
10
degree
to
50
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
or
it
could
be
ultra-rapid
freezing,
if
the
rate
is
more
than
100
degree
centigrade
per
hour .
In
this
regard
let
me
also
say
that,
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
1
degree
centigrade
per
hour
or
10
degree
centigrade
per
hour
or
more
than
100
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
right.
Obviously ,
you
have
seen
earlier .
I
said
that,
to
measure
the
temperature,
thermometers
and
other
things
are
used.
So,
in
that
other
things,
it
could
be
say ,
thermocouple,
and
what
is
thermocouple?
That
is
junction
of
two
dissimilar
metal,
right.Junction
of
two
dissimilar
metal,
that
forms
an
EMF
and
that
is
converted
into,
or
calibrated
into
temperature,
and
it
is
seen
in
any
measuring
device,
right,
that
can
be
digital
or
anything,
right.
So,
with
the
help
of
thermocouple,
you
can
measure
the
temperature,
that
is
one.
So,
if
we
plot
time
versus
temperature,
so
what
is
the
rate
at
which
the
freezing
is
going
on,
you
can
find
out,
and
tell,
whether
it
is
1
to
10
or
10
to
50
or
above
100
degree
centigrade.
This
is
one
way
of
knowing.
Another
way
could
be,
which
is
of
course,
very
dif ficult
to
measure
that.
Y ou
have
the
food
material,
say
this,
we
take
as
the
food
material
and
say
this
is
symmetrical,
right.
So,
you
are
cooling
from
both
the
sides,
right.
So,
what
will
happen?
First
say ,
a
layer
of
ice
will
be
formed,
in
both
the
sides,
then
this
layer
will
shift
after
sometime
to
this,
and
after
sometime
to
this
also,
right.
So,
that
means,
the
ice
front
is
gradually
going
to
the
centre,
right.
Now ,
if
you
know
that,
how
long
it
is
taking
from
this
layer
to
this
layer ,
then
you
can
also
say
what
is
the
freezing
rate,
but,
it
is
very
dif ficult,
because
how
you
will
be
finding
out
that
this
layer ,
this
layer ,
or
this
layer
got
frozen,
right?
That
is
why ,
it
is
always
better
to
do
with
thermometer
or
temperature
indicator .
So,
we
call
slow
freezing:
1
to
10
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
commercial
freezing:
10
to
50
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
and
subsequently
the
ultra
rapid
freezing
or
rapid
freezing,
which
is
above
100
degree
centigrade
per
hour .
During
freezing
of
tissues,
water
from
solution
is
transferred
into
ice
crystals,
of
a
variable,
but
rather ,
high
degree
of
purity .
Non-aqueous
constituents
are
therefore,
concentrated
in
a
diminished
quantity
of
unfrozen
water .
Unfrozen
phase
changes
significantly
in
pH
or
rather ,
significantly
pH,
titrable
acidity ,
ionic
strength,
viscosity ,
freezing
point,
surface
and
interfacial
tensions
etc.
that
is
in
unfrozen
phase.
Oxygen
and
carbon
dioxide
may
be
expelled
out
from
solution
and
macromolecules
are
posed
closer
together ,
water
structure
and
water
solute
interactions
may
be
drastically
altered.
Then,
we
can
say
that,
we
have
already
told
you
that,
there
is
slow
freezing,
there
is
moderate
rate
of
freezing,
and
there
is
quick
freezing
or
rapid
freezing,
right.
Definitely ,
we
said,
depending
on
the
rate
at
which
the
temperature
is
being
lowered.
W e
said
1
to
10
degree
is
slow ,
10
to
15,
50
is
moderate,
and
above
100,
is
quick
or
rapid,
right.
Now ,
after
doing
it,
if
we
look
at
the
say ,
a
food
material
under
microscope.
So,
we
have
taken
a
section
and
looking
into
through
microscope,
right
and
for
both
the
cases,
one
for
slow
freezing,
one
for
slow
freezing,
and
another
for
quick
freezing.
If
you
look
at
under
microscope,
then
you
will
see
that,
the
food
materials
having,
as
we
have
just
said,
cells
and
tissues,
and
there
are
intercellular
or
intracellular
food
material
also,
because
if
this
is
a
cell,
and
if
this
is
a
cell
in
between,
there
could
be
intracellular
orintercellular
materials,
and
intra
means
inside
also
there
are
materials,
right,
of
course,
this
is
magnified.
So,
those
cell
materials,
both
inter
and
intra,
they
will
gradually
freeze,
the
solvent,
that
is
water ,
and
say ,
an
ice
crystal
has
formed,
right,
and
again,
you
are
lowering
down
the
temperature
at
the
same
rate.
So,
as
we
said
earlier
that,
if
one
ice
crystal
is
formed,
and
if
surrounding
water
molecules,
they
find
that,
forming
another
ice
crystal
is
not
possible
for
them
under
that
condition,
it
is
also
slow
freezing,
right,
under
that
condition,
it
is
not
possible
to
form
another
crystal
by
them.
So,
they
will
go
and
join
already
formed
crystal.
So,
the
size
of
the
crystal
will
go
up,
that
is
what
it
is
happening
here,
right,
size
of
that
crystal
is
going
up,
going
up,
and
it
may
be
to
that
extent
that,
these
cell
materials,
like
say ,
you
10
people
are
standing
in
one
place,
and
if
another
person
and
you
are
standing
very
closely ,
very
closely ,
and
if
another
person
comes
there,
then
you
have
to
adjust
between
you,
right,
keeping
the
boundary ,
that
may
be,
you
cannot
cross
this
boundary ,
either
this
side,
or
that
side,
you
cannot
cross
the
boundary .
So,
what
will
happen?
Y ou
all
have
to
adjust,
right
and
accommodate
the
new
entrant,
right.
So
that
is
what
these
cells
have
been
doing,
with
lowering
of
the
temperature.
So,
the
cells
are
getting
shattered,
getting
deformed,
and
ultimately
may
be
ruptured,
right,
because
of
the
increase
of
the
size
of
the
crystal,
right.
Now ,
if
that
be
true,
then,
it
is
happening
in
this
case,
one
more
thing,
I
should
say ,
I
don't
know
how
many
of
you
know
that,
volume
of
ice
is
bigger
than
that
of
the
same
water
right.
There
is,
if
9
volume
of
water
is
transformed
into
ice,
it
forms
1 1
volume
of
ice,
that
means,
2
volume
is
increased,
it
is
9
-1 1,
right.
So,
that
9
-1 1
factor
is
coming.
If
it
is
more,
like
say ,
90
then
1 10,
if
it
is
900,
then
1 100
right.
So,
as
much
you
can
think
of,
this
is
one
way ,
another
way
is
that,
this
is
increasing,
if
we
have
the
decrease,
right,
you
had
0.9,
right
and
now
it
has
become
1.1
right,
increase,
1.1.
So,
if
it
is
0.09,
then
it
is
0.1 1,
like
that,
you
go
down
as
much
as
you
can
think
of.
So,
increase
in
size,
as
you
could
think
of
9
–
1 1;
to
9,000
to
90000
to
9
lakhs,
right,
the
decrease
also
you
can
think
of
like
0.9,
or
0.09,
then,
0.0000009.
So,
that
will
be
very
minute.
So,
this
is
what
is
happening
in
the
this,
9
-1 1,
is
happening
in
the
slow
freezing,
right.
So,
that
1 1
has
become
very
very
high,
right,
and
the
cells,
either
got
deformed,
or
got
fractured,
right,
now ,
if
we
look
at
the
other
one,
where
rapid
freezing
is
happening,
then
the
lower
one
which
we
said
say ,
0.099
or
0.0009.
So,
there,
the
size
of
the
ice
crystal
is
very
small,
and
here
it
was
size
of
the
ice
crystal
is
very
high,
but
number
of
ice
crystals
are
also
very
low .
As
in
the
rapid
freezing,
where
it
is
more
than
100
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
right.
So,
there,
what
happened
your
ice
crystals
size
is
very
low ,
and
number
of
ice
crystals
formed
are
also
very
high,
right.
So,
in
slow
freezing,
you
have
less
number
of
ice
crystal
size
is
very
high,
or
big
whereas,
in
this,
number
of
ice
crystals
forms
are
very
high,
and
the
size
of
the
ice
crystal
is
very
very
low ,right.
So,
what
will
happen?
That
same
9
-1 1,
you
have
0.0009
and
that
converted
into
1 1
equivalent,
right,
and
you
see,
for
their
small
one
this
is
under
frozen
condition.
So,
when
you
are
thawing,
right,
that
is,
you
are
defrosting
or
thawing.
So,
that
time
this
part
will
get
again
converted
into
ice.
Now ,
1 1
part
of
ice
is
converted
to
9
part
of
water ,
right.
So,
volume
requirement
is
less,
but
already
by
this
process,
you
have
deformed
the
cells,
and
tissues.
So,
what
will
happen?
Those
cells
and
tissues
are
not
elastic.
So,
it
will
not
be
possible
for
them
to
come
back
to
the
original.
So,
that
is
why ,
when
this
1 1
is
getting
converted
to
9,
that
liquid
is
getting
out
of
the
food
material
and
this
is
called
drip
loss,
DRIP ,
drip
loss,
right,
to
the
tune
of
10
to
15
percent
drip
loss
may
occur
for
slow
freezing,
right.
Since,
our
time
is
not
there,
let
me
tell
a
very
very ,
I
mean
a
story ,
a
little,
that
may
be
useful
to
understand.
The
prime
minister
of
India
wanted
to
give
some
gift
to
the
prime
minister
of
or
president
of
USA.
So,
he
said
that,
“I
would
like
to
send
you,
say ,
100
kg
of
frozen
prawn”,
prawn
is,
maybe
1000
rupees
a
kg
at
the
moment,
right.
So,
100
kg
or
maybe
1000
kg
whatever ,
I
would
like
to
present
you
if
you
like
then
the
other
side
said
yes,
fine,
you
send.
Now ,
the
other
side,
I
mean
our
prime
minister
sent
that
1000
kg
to
the
president
of
United
States.
Now ,
as
you
know ,
both
this
is
true,
both
in
India
as
well
as
in
any
other
countries,
when
anything
is
getting
imported,
then
that
is
first
checked,
its
quality
is
checked
with
all
respects,
and
then,
it
is
sent
to
the
person.
Now ,
when
they
thawed
it,
this
1000
kg,
they
saw
that,
it
is
not
1000
kg,
10
percent
of
it
means,
100,
so,
it
is
900
kg
is
there.
So,
they
reported
to
their
president,
and
their
president
called
our
prime
minister
and
said,
“you
said
that
1000
kg
you
have
sent,
but
I
got
900
kg,
where
this
100
kg
went
up,
but,
our
prime
minister
said
that,
“believe
me,
I
have
seen
it
by
my
own
eyes,
when
it
was
being
weighed,
and
it
was
1000
kg.
It
was
never
900
kg”,
but
the
other
side
said,
“no,
it
is
900
kg
I
received.
Now ,
the
thing
is
that,
none
of
them
were
saying
wrong,
or
lying.
Both
were
correct,
because,
yes,
1000
kg
was
given,
and
900
kg
was
received,
because
if
the
freezing
method
used
was
commercial
one,
where
it
was
50
degree
centigrade,
10
to
50
degree
centigrade
per
hour ,
where
the
drip
loss
was
10
to
15
percent.
So,
when
they
thawed
it
to
check,
that
time,
this
10
to
15
percent
say ,10
percent,
that
is
100
kg
went
out
by
drip
loss.
So,
actually
they
received
900
kg,
whereas,
our
prime
minister
sent
really ,
1000
kg,
but
they
did
not
receive.
This
is
only
because
of
the
freezing
method
applied,
right
ok.
This
I
had
said
jokingly ,
so
that
it
is
in
your
mind
right.
Now ,
after
this
the
major
point
which
is
required
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that,
ice
crystals
are
relatively
pure,
even
when
they
originate
from
a
complex
system,
and
proper
to
assign
an
expansion
value
approximately
9
percent
to
the
quantity
of
water
that
freezes,
which
I
said,
9
-1 1,
right.
System
changes
is
not
uniform
throughout
the
food
material,
because
most
other
constituents,
contract
asthe
temperature
is
lowered
leading
to
localized
areas
of
expansion,
that
is
formation
of
ice
crystals
and
localized
areas
of
contraction,
that
is
likelihood
to
be,
because
of
the
stresses,
and
possibility
of
mechanical
damage.
So,
more
likely
in
plant
tissues,
with
its
rigid
structure
and
poorly
aligned
cells,
than
in
muscle
that
is
animal,
that
unlike
plant
tissues,
animal
tissues
are
more
pliable,
having
more
pliable
consistency ,
and
parallel
arrangements
of
cells
or
fibers
are
there.
Then,
this
also
should
have
been
white
however ,
you
see
that
ef fect
of
initial
concentration
on
the
decrease
in
volume,
and
the
increase
in
molality
of
the
unfrozen
phase.
So,
if
you
consider
that
you
have
one,
where
5
solutes
are
there,
and
you
have
another ,
where,
say
15
solutes
are
there,
right,
and
in
the
unfrozen
phase
of
1
litre,
it
is
like
that.
Now ,
after
that,
if
you
are
freezing
it,
then
what
is
happening,
that
frozen
1
litre,
this
part
is
that,
this
part
has
been
frozen
into
ice,
and
the
unfrozen
part
contain
the
solutes.
This
is
also
same,
unfortunately
this
solutes
are
not
seen
here,
because
of
the
colour
masking,
right.
So,
here
also
15
solutes
are
there,
and
here
5
solutes
are
there,
right.
So,
if
that
be
true,
then
after
analysis,
what
you
can
see?
Y ou
can
see
that,
the
concentration
of
the
unfrozen
phase,
it
was
5
solute
per
litre,
and
it
was
15
solute
per
litre.
In
this
case,
15
solute
in
this
case
5
solute,
right.
In
unfrozen
phase
of
solution,
it
was
30
solutes
per
litre,
in
this
case,
like
one
fifth,
it
is
5/6,
if
it
is
one
sixth,
5/6
are
frozen.
So,
30
solutes
per
litre
in
this
case,
and
30
solutes
per
litre
also
in
this
case.
So,
increase
in
concentration
by
freezing
is
6
times
and
here
it
is
2
times.
Then,
volume
of
unfrozen
phase
after
freezing,
that
is
one
sixth
of
litre,
this
part
one
sixth
of
litre,
and
this
is
half
a
litre,
this
part
right,
this
is
half
a
litre.
Then
what
we
can
say
finally ,
the
amount
of
ice
formed
in
this
case
is
5/6
of
a
litre,
this
is
the
5/6
of
a
litre
and
in
this
case,
this
is
the
half
of
a
litre,
right.
So,
amount
of
ice,
which
is
formed
is
5/6
of
a
litre,
and
this
is
half
a
litre.
That
means,
if
you
remember ,
at
some
time,
we
said
that,
the
law ,
which
is
governing
this,
that
was
Raoult's
law .
So,
Raoult's
law
as
it
says,
as
the
concentration
is
increasing
in
the
unfrozen
phase,
the
lowering
of
temperature
or
the
freezing
point
is
decreasing,
as
well
the
melting
point,
or
not
melting
point,
as
well
the
boiling
point
is
increasing.
So,
this
is
corroborating
that
Raoult's
law ,
and
this
we
will
be
using
in
some
case.
And
that
this
information
is
very
useful.
So,
we
will
use
it
in
some
case,
and
that
time
we
will
also
give
some
reference
to
this,
ok.
So,
today
our
time
is
over ,
and
we
are
running
with
freezing,
which
is
the,
one
of
the
best
application
of
low
temperature,
one
of
the
best
application
will
come
in
the
next
class,
and
try
to
finish
the
freezing
part
as
muchas
we
can
ok.
If
it
is
possible,
we
will
try
to
cover
up
a
little
quickly ,
and
then
subsequent
things,
we
will
also
go
into.
Thank
you.
So,
nice
of
you.
