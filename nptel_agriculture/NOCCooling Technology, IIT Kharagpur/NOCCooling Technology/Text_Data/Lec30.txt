Carnot Refrigeration Cycles (Contd.)
Good
morning,
my
dear
friends
and
students.
We
have
started
with
Carnot
Refrigeration
Cycle,
right
and
in
the
last
class,
we
have
shown
the
COP
of
Carnot
Refrigeration
Cycle,
right.
So,
this
is
a
Carnot
Refrigeration
Cycle
continuation
class,
and
we
have
done
the
COP
of
Carnot
Refrigeration
Cycle,
which
is
a
function
of
evaporator
and
condenser
temperatures
only,
and
is
independent
of
the
nature
of
the
working
substance.
The
Carnot
COP
sets
an
upper
limit
for
refrigeration
systems
operating
between
two
constant
temperature
thermal
reservoirs,
that
is,
heat
source
and
heat
sink.
From
Carnot's
theorems,
for
the
same
heat
source
and
sink
temperatures,
no
irreversible
cycle
can
have
COP
higher
than
that
of
the
Carnot
COP
right.
This
we
have
also
seen
in
the
Carnot
heat
engine, if you remember .
Now ,
we
come
back
to
schematic
diagram
of
the
refrigeration
cycle
represented
by
a
TS
plane,
right.
So,
this
is
the
TS
plane,
this
is
temperature,
and
this
is
entropy ,
right
and
this
was
our
dome
right.
We
started
with
point
1,
then
we
went
up
to
point
2,
then
point
3,
and
then
point
4,
right.
So,
if
you
remember
some
classes
back,
we
had
shown
that
curve
like
this,
that
was
1,
2,
3,
and
we
said,
the
area
under
this
curve,
is
either
the
work
or whatever .
So,
here
also,
we
are
looking
at
the
area
under
the
curves,
1,
2,
3,
and
4
right.
So,
we
see
that,
1
to
2
to
2
to
3,
3
to
4,
to
4
to
back
to
1.
This
was
our
Carnot
cycle
right.
And
if
we
say
now
that,
in
this
TS
plane
that,
the
COP
of
a
Carnot
refrigeration
system
increases
as
the
evaporator
temperature
increases,
right
and
condenser
temperature
decreases,
right,
and
this
can
be
explained
very
easily
with
the
help
of
the
TS
diagram,
as
we
have
shown
in
the
previous
diagram,
right.
So,
we
can
go
back,
perhaps,
back
and
forth,
we
can
do
and
if
we
see
that,
this
was
which,
we
are
referring
to,
that,
this
figure
says
in
the
TS
diagram
that
1,
2,
3
and
4.
So,
the
area
under
the
curve
will
let
us
know
that
how
much
work, how much heat has been  given, or work has been obtained or done, whatever .
So,
COP
is
the
ratio
of
the
area
1
to
4,
A
1
to
4
to
B.
So,
let
us
look
into
that
area,
A
1
to
4
to
B
back
to
A
right.
So,
this
is
the
refrigeration
part
right.
So,
this
is
1
to
area
A
1,
A
1
4
B
that
is
Q
e,
this
increases,
and
the
area
1,
2,
3,
4,
that
is,
W
net,
this
decreases.
As
aresult COP  increases rapidly .  So let us go back to that, so, we said that area A 1 4 B A.
So,
this
area,
which
is
shown,
that
is,
equal
to
Q
e,
as
it
is
written,
right,
and
the
area
1,
2,
3,
4
that
is
this
area,
is
the
W
net
right.
So,
COP,
as
we
know ,
is
equal
to
Q
e
over
W
net
right.
So,
if
it
is
Q
e
over
W
net
is
the
COP,
then,
we
can
say
that,
our
evaporator
temperature
is
T
e,
our
evaporator
temperature
is
T
e,
and
condenser
temperature
is
T
c,
right.
So,
as
we
increase
T
e,
if
we
increase
T
e,
so,
this
line
then
comes
here.
So
Q
e
goes up whereas, W net goes down.
So,
COP,
which
was
Q
e
over
W
net,
that
becomes
increasing,
right.
Q
e
is
more
W
net
is
less.
So,
COP
goes
up,
and
the
reverse,
if
you
do
the
reverse,
that
is,
if
we
decrease
T
e,
if
we
decrease
T
c,
keeping
T
e
constant,
keeping
T
e
constant,
if
we
decrease
T
c,
that
means,
now,
this
is
like
this.
So,
W
net
decreases,
right,
but,
Q
e
remains
same.
So
COP
is equal to Q e over W net, W net is decreasing. So, if we decrease T c, COP  increases.
So,
if
we
increase
T
e,
keeping
T
c
constant,
COP
increases.
If
we
decrease
T
c,
keeping
T
e
constant,
COP
increases.
The
reverse,
again,
other
way
round.
If
we
look
at,
what
is
that,
other
way
round?
If
we,
in
place
of
increasing
T
e,
keeping
T
c
constant,
if
we
decrease
T
e,
right,
then,
Q
e
decreases
and
W
net
increases.
So,
Q
e
decreases,
and
W
net
increases,
right.
So,
if
that
be
true,
then,
COP
is
Q
e
divided
by
W
net.
So,
W
net
is
increasing,
and
Q
e
is
decreasing,
right.
So,
that
means,
COP
is
decreasing.
Isn't
it?
This
becomes more, this becomes less.
So,
the
value
of
COP
is
decreasing
right,
when,
we
have
reduced
the
evaporator
temperature,
keeping
the
condenser
temperature
same,
right.
Now ,
if
we
do
the
other
one
also,
that
is,
if
we
keep
the
T
e
constant,
right,
if
we
keep
T
e
constant,
if
we
increase
T
c,
then,
W
net
increases,
but,
Q
e
remains
same,
right.
W
net
is
increasing,
but
Q
e
remains
same.
So,
Q
e
over
W
net
is
COP,
and
W
net
being
increased,
denominator
is
increased.
So,
in
that
case,
if
we
increase
the
condenser
temperature,
then
also,
COP
is
decreasing,
right.
So,
increase
in
COP
is
by
increasing
the
evaporator
temperature,
evaporator
temperature,
or
T
e,
evaporator
temperature
increasing
,or
second
is
condenser
temperature,
that
is,
T
c,
condenser ,
if
we
decrease,
then
we
get
increase
in
COP,
right.
And
the
other
one,
if
we
look
at
the
other
one,
that
is,
if
we
look
at
the
other
one,
that
is,
what
we
are
saying,
decrease
in
COP
is
because,
one,
we
said
that,
if
the
T
e
is
decreased,
that
is,
T
e,
evaporator
decreasing,
number
1,
and
number
2,
we
said
if
we
increase
the
condenser
temperature,
right.
So
T
c,
condenser ,
if
we
increase,
then
also
COP
is
decreasing.
So,
four
cases,
we
have
said,
one
COP
increase
will
happen
keeping
the
condenser
temperature
same,
if
we
increase
the
evaporator
temperature,
then,
COP
willincrease,
keeping
the
evaporator
temperature
same,
if
we
increase
the
condenser
temperature,
then,
if
we
decrease
the
condenser
temperature,
then,
COP
will
increase
whereas,
COP
will
decrease,
if
we,
keeping
the
condenser
temperature
same,
if
we
decrease
the
evaporator
temperature,
then,
it
will
decrease
as
well.
If
the
evaporator
temperature
is
same,
but,
if
we
increase
the
condenser
temperature,
then
also
COP
will
decrease, right. So, this we have understood from the figure 2, explicitly , right ok.
Then,
this
is
what,
we
have
written
here,
elaborately ,
that,
as
shown
in
the
figure
2,
COP
is
the
ratio
of
the
area
A
1,
4
B
2,
the
area
A
1
to
the
area
1
2
3
4,
for
a
fixed
condenser
temperature,
T
c,
as
the
evaporator
temperature,
T
e
increases,
area,
A
1
4
B
that
is
Q
e
increases,
and
area
1
2
3
4,
that
is,
W
net
decreases,
as
a
result,
COP
increases
rapidly .
Similarly ,
for
a
fixed
evaporator
temperature,
T
e,
as
the
condensing
temperature,
T
c
increases,
the
net
work
input,
that
is
area
under
1
2
3
4,
increases,
even
though
cooling
output
remains
constant.
As
a
result,
COP
decreases,
right.
This
was
also
observed,
from
our
figure
2,
which
we
have
shown
right.
Now ,
for
figure
3,
that
shows
variation
of
Carnot
COP
with
evaporator
temperature,
for
different
condenser
temperatures.
It
can
be
seen
that
the
COP
increases
shortly ,
with
evaporator
temperatures,
particularly
at
high
condensing temperatures.
COP
reduces,
as
the
condenser
temperature
increases,
but,
the
effect
becomes
marginal
at
low
evaporator
temperatures.
It
will
be
shown
later,
that,
actual
vapour
compression
refrigeration
systems
also
behave
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
Carnot
refrigeration
systems,
as
far
as
the
performance
trends
are
concerned.
Now ,
let
us
look
into
that
figure.
This
figure
says
that,
COP
versus
T
e,
that
is
evaporator
temperature.
COP
versus
evaporator
temperature,
for
different
condenser
temperatures.
This
is,
say
condenser
temperature
1,
this
is
say,
condenser
temperature
2,
and
this
is
say,
condenser
temperature
3,, right.
What
is
the
effect
of
COP
for
different
T
e
right?
So,
obviously ,
this
T
c
1
is
higher
than
T
c
2,
is
higher
than
T
c
3,
right.
So,
no,
the
T
c's
are
increasing
like
this,
right.
So,
this
T
c
1
is
lowest,
T
c
2,
is
moderate,
T
c
3,
is
the
higher ,
as
it
is
seen
right.
So,
for
a
given
T
e,
this
is
the
given
T
e,
right,
as
the
condenser
temperature
increases,
COP
decreases,
right.
COP
decreases,
as
the
condenser
temperature
increases.
For
a
given
T
e,
the
other
way, as the condenser temperature decreases, COP  increases right.
So,
this
is
what
we
have
seen
from
the
figure
2
also,
where
for
a
given
evaporator
temperature,
like
for
a
given
evaporator
temperature,
like
this,
this
is
the,
say,
given
evaporator
temperature,
and
if
we
go
vertical,
right.
So,
it
could
not
have
been
proper ,
if
we
go
vertical
right.
So,
for
a
given
T
e,
so,
this
is
a
temperature
T
e
1,
for
a
given
temperature
T
e,
what
we
said,
and
condenser
temperature
is
increasing,
this
way,
as
it
isshown.
So,
this
is
T
c
1,
this
is
T
c
2,
this
is
T
c
3,
and
T
c
1
is
less
than
T
c
2,
is
less
than
T
c
3,
right.
So,
the
COP
of
T
c
3,
is
like
this
COP
of
T
2,
is
like
this
and
COP
of
T
c
1
is
like this, right.
As
we
can
see
that,
we
said,
this
is
the
highest
T
c
3,
temperature,
this
is
moderate,
and
this
is
the
lowest,
right.
So,
as
the
condenser
temperature
is
lowering,
the
evaporator
temperature,
keeping
same
COP
is
increasing
and
the
reverse,
keeping
the
same
T
e,
as
the
condenser
temperature
is
increasing,
the
COP
is
decreasing,
which,
is
true
in
our
earlier
figure
2.
I
will
confirm
from
there,
so
that,
there
is
no
confusion,
and
if
we
go
back
to
that,
then
we
get
this
that
this
is
the
one
which
you
are
referring
to
right.
We
said
that
if
we
had
if
we
draw
the
plot
again,
here,
this
was
COP,
right
these
were
the
3
condenser
temperatures,
this
is
the
evaporator
temperature.
So,
T
evaporator ,
we
said
for
a given T e, right, if this is the given temperature,  COP  is here 1, this is 2 and this is 3.
What
we
said,
condenser
temperature
was
increasing,
like
this,
that
means,
this
T
c
1,
is
less
than
T
c
2,
is
less
than
T
c
3,
right.
So,
if
this
be
true,
then,
we
are
also
getting
it
from
here,
that,
what
did
we
say?
That,
for
a
given
T
e,
so,
this
is
the
given
T
e,
we
are
decreasing,
this
way,
it
is
decreasing,
we
are
decreasing
the
condenser
temperature,
that
means,
we
are
lowering
down
the
condenser
temperature,
that
means,
W
net
is
decreasing,
whereas,
Q
e
is
same.
So,
COP
is
Q
e
divided
by
W
net,
and
W
net
is
low.
So,
COP  is increased, right the reverse T c is increasing, right.
So,
T
c
is
increasing,
that
means,
we
are
increasing
here.
So,
W
net
is
increasing,
Q
e
remains
identical.
So,
W
net
is
increasing.
So,
COP
is
decreasing,
right.
COP
is
decreasing,
this
is,
what
exactly ,
we
have
shown
from
that
figure.
So,
we
have
now
shown that the ef fect of the condenser and the evaporator temperature.
Similarly ,
this
was
a
plot,
for
this
was
a
plot
for
constant
temperature
versus,
COP
against,
COP,
against
different
condenser
temperatures.
Similarly ,
if
we
have,
a
plot
of
COP,
which
at
this
moment,
we
do
not
have
here,
that
this
is
T
c.
If
we
look
at,
then
also,
we
will
see
the
same,
that
if
we
lower
down
the
evaporator
temperature,
for
a
given
condenser
temperature,
this
Q
e
lowers
down,
W
net
increases.
So,
COP
decreases,
whereas,
the
other
one,
if
we
increase
the
evaporator
temperature,
giving
the
same
condenser
temperature,
then
Q
e
increases,
W
net
decreases.
So,
COP
increases.
This
also
can
be
shown,
and
that,
if
we
have,
COP
versus
T
c
plot
against
different
evaporator
temperature,
we
can
say
that,
right.
So,
this
is
our,
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that,
how
the
COP
is
getting
increased
or
decreased
with
the
increase
or
decrease
of
the
condenser ,
or
evaporator temperatures, right.
So,
if
we
go
back
to
that
point,
then,
we
say,
this.
So,
we
say
that,
the
condensertemperature
and
evaporator
temperature
has
a
specific
role
to
the
COP
of
the
refrigeration
cycle.
This,
you
keep
in
mind,
because,
subsequently ,
when
we
are
in
real,
or
actual
refrigeration
cycle,
this
thing
will
be
very
much
needed,
that,
for
a
given
T
c,
if
the
T
e
is
increased,
then,
COP
is
increased.
If
the
evaporator
temperature
is
decreased,
then
COP
is
decreased,
for
a
given
condenser
temperature,
and
for
a
given
evaporator
temperature,
if
the
condenser
temperature
is
decreased,
COP
is
increased,
and
if
the
condenser
temperature
is
increased
then,
COP
is
decreased.
This
is
what
explicitly
we
have
to
keep
in
mind,
and
we
have
shown,
one
COP
versus
temperature,
that
is
evaporator
temperature
plot
for
different
condenser
temperatures.
Similarly ,
if
we
have
plots
for
COP
versus
condenser
temperatures,
for
different
evaporator
temperatures,
then
also
we
can
show
whatever we are claiming  right.
So,
hopefully ,
you
are
able
to
understand,
the
T-S
diagram,
from
where
it
is
more
evident,
and
we
can
really
look
into
the
effect,
and
I
repeatedly ,
I
am
showing
you
that,
this
figure,
we
should
keep
in
mind,
right.
This
figure,
we
should
keep
in
mind,
that,
what
is
the
Q
e,
that
is
the
quantum
of
heat
or
refrigeration,
we
obtain,
this
is
Q
e,
is
equivalent
to
the
quantum
of
refrigeration
we
are
obtaining
for
a
given
net
work
input
right.
This
COP,
we
are,
we
can
again
say,
alternatively ,
I
hope,
this
proverb,
you
know ,
how
many
paddy
how
many
rice?
This
proverb,
perhaps,
you
may
know
that,
how
much
rice
you
are
obtaining,
from
how
much
paddy .
So,
that
is
what
is
the
COP,
that
may
be
from
100
kg
of
paddy ,
you
if
you
are
getting
70
kg
of
rice,
then
your
performance
is
70
kg
of
rice
you
are
getting.
75
kg
of
rice
then,
you
are
getting
75
percent.
If
you
are
giving,
65
kg
of
rice,
you
are
getting
65
percent,
that
is
what
exactly ,
that
same
proverb
that
how
many
paddy
how many rice right.
So,
how
much
you
have
given
input
as
work,
how
much
you
have
obtained
as
refrigeration
effect,
as
output?
This
is
the
COP,
right.
So,
with
this
we
thank
you
all
for
careful
listening,
hopefully ,
you
will
go
through
the
class
notes,
or
class
records
for
your
betterment of understanding. Thank you.
