Psychr ometrics Contd
Good
morning.
We
are
in
Psychometrics
and
this
is
continued
class
of
psychometrics
right.
This
is
lecture
20,
and
continuation
of
psychometrics.
We
have
covered
up
to
the
measurement
of
relative
humidity ,
right.
We
have
covered
up
to
that
measurement
of
relative
humidity ,
but
that
was
with
the
help
of
dry
bulb
and
wet
bulb
temperature.
We
said there is one more way by which it can be done.
This
is
called
hair
hygrometer
right.
This
is
called
hair
hygrometer
and
I
said
the
other
class
that
expansion
of
hair
is
a
function
of
moisture
content.
It
elongates
and
contracts
with
the
moisture
content
right
and
this
typical
behavior
of
the
hair
with
moisture
is
used
in
hair
hygrometer .
As
you
see
from
this
picture
that
it
is
very
complicated
though
you
are
getting
a
graph
also,
but
even
then,
both
manufacturing
and
then
using
it,
is
very
very
difficult, That  is why hair hygrometer is not so popular  typically , in industry .
It
could
be
very
very
helpful
in
academic
purposes,
where
absolutely
correct
value
you
need.
You
can
read
the
graph
which
is
coming
up,
but
it
is
very
very
difficult
to
read
it.
Similarly ,
with
respect
to
the
Indian
industry
concern,
Indian
industry ,
it
is
absolutely
very
tough,
because
the
people
who
run
these
industries,
not
I
am,
not
talking
about
scientist,
or
technologist,
or
things
like
that,
typical
workers,
please
do
not
take
it
otherwise,
they
are
normally
not
educated,
neither
there
is
no
way
of
making
them
educated,
nor
anybody
takes
care
of
the
individual's
education.
So,
for
them,
it
becomes
very
tough,
right
and
the
most
useful
one
is
the
one
which
we
have
already
said,
that
is
the
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature.
I
will
show
you,
I
just
showed,
one
table
earlier ,
which
will
come
back,
once
we
finish
this
hair
hygrometer ,
that
it
functions
on
the
basis
of
the
expansion and contraction of the hair  with respect to moisture content.
So
humidity ,
stretches
the
hair
whether
it
is
human
hair
or
animal
hair
or
synthetic
hair,
whatever
it
be,
it
is
a
function
of
moisture
content.
So,
while
dryness,
it
shortens
it,
and
while
it
is
wet,
it
expands.
The
hygrometer
has
the
job
of
stretching
hair
between
a
fixed
and
a
moral
point
to
measure
humidity
over
time.
Other
kinds
of
hygrometers
use
materials,
with
electrical
resistance,
that
also
can
be
used
electrical
resistance,
becausethat
is
also
a
function
of
moisture,
that
varies
with
the
amount
of
moisture
absorbed
by
electrical
resistance,
if
somebody
makes,
and
then
the
making
may
be
easy,
but
then
making
it,
what
we
call
that,
it
is
the
trial
should
be
given,
right
and
then
only
when
it
is
matching
with
actual
one,
then
it
should
be
used.
With
such
hygrometers
a
measurement
of
electrical
resistance
can
be
calibrated,
that
calibration
is
the
fundamental
thing,
can
be
calibrated as a humidity measurement, right ok.
Now
let
us
go
back
to
this
one
where
we
started
with.This
is
a
table,
as
I
told
in
our
industry
level,
the
people
who
work
in
the
floor ,
most
of
them
are
not
so
much
educated.
So
for
them
it
becomes
very
difficult
to
handle
and
then
find
out
from
the
chart
the
relative
humidity
or
the
other
one
which
we
have
already
said
that
hair
hygrometer ,
it
is
really
tough
for
which
a
very
easy
thing
can
be
made.
If
you
know ,
your
level
of
temperature
variation,
both,
dry
and
wet
bulb
then
you
can
make
a
table
like
this,
and
give
that
table
to
the
workers.
They
can
read,
at
the
most
from
the
thermometer ,
what
is
the temperature right.
If
it
is
digital
then
there
is
no
problem,
but
mercury
thermometer
making
digital
may
be
difficult
mercury
in
glass
right.
Got
now,
someday
it
may
come
up
the
way
science
is
progressing,
someday
it
may
come
up,
but
as
of
now
mercury
in
glass
has
not
been
made
or
digitized.
However ,
so
they
can
read
the
wet
and
dry
bulb
temperature
and
the
thermometers
are
swung
as
I
said
that
it
needs
some
latent
heat
to
vaporize
to
get
that
latent
heat
it
may
require
to
swung
or
as
I
said
that
if
it
is
fixed
then
some
blow
of
air
is
made.
So,
if
it
is
swung
around
the
handle
then
the
real
wet
bulb
temperature
is
obtained.
Then,
when
swung
water ,
evaporates
from
the
wick
cooling
the
wet
bulb
temperature
and
thereby
you
know ,
the
wet
bulb
temperature
and
dry
bulb
temperature,
already
it
is
open, you are  able to find out.
So,
drier
air
results
at
lower
temperature
right
this
example
also
I
have
given.
So,
when
you
have
this
both
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
as
you
see
from
the
table
as
you
see
from
the
table
here
you
are
writing
the
difference
between
wet
and
dry
bulb
temperature
in
Fahrenheit
again
why
Fahrenheit
I
have
said
many
times
that
it
is
a
whole
number
that
is
why
it
is
easy
to
remember
if
it
is
a
centigrade
then
it
will
always
associate
with
decimal.
So,
this
may
not
be
helpful
or
difficult
to
handle.
So,
the
difference
between
the
wet
and
dry
bulb
temperature,
that
is
in
a
column
right
and
the
dry
bulb
temperature,
in
Fahrenheit
that
is
in
many
columns
as,
I
told
if,
you
know
your
normal
working
range
of
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
then
that
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature,
you
will
make
it.
Here,
just
for
understanding,
we
have
taken
60
as
the
lower
limit
and
88
as
the
higher
limit with a dif ference of 4 degree Fahrenheit right.
So
60,
64,
68,
72,
76,
80,
84,
88.
This
type
of
temperature
of
the
dry
bulb,
we
havetaken
and
on
the
left
side,
left
column,
we
have
taken,
the
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
right.
And
if
the
difference
is
1
degree,
it
could
be
1
degree,
it
could
be
2,
3,
4,
5,
6,
7,
8,
9
or,
as
much
as
you
want,
right
since
it
will
not,
it
will
be
beyond
the
page.
So,
that
is
why
I
have
not
taken.
So,
if
you
know ,
the
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature,
you
know
that
point
say,
5
degree,
the
difference
and if the dry bulb temperature is say , 76 degree then you  go to 5 and 76.
This
number
tells
you
that
what
is
the
relative
humidity ,
that
is
62
coming
as
62
right.
Similarly ,
the
other
one,
if
the
difference
is
6
degree
and
if
the
dry
bulb
is
72
degree
then
the
relative
humidity
is
54
percent
right.
So
you
can
make
one
such
table
and
give
it
to
your
subordinate
who
are
not
so
educated
and
they
can
easily
handle
this
type
of
hygrometer
for
finding
out
the
relative
humidity ,
right.
So,
I
repeat,
a
little,
that
we
have
the
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
on
one
column,
and
the
dry
bulb
temperatures,
in
different
columns,
you
could
have
taken
60,
61,
62,
63,
64,
like
that,
no
problem
you
could
have
taken,
but
again,
as
we
said
that
within
this
frame
it
will
not
be
possible
to
show
like
that.
So,
we
have
taken
a
4
degree
difference
and
we
have
found
out
the
table
and
wanted
to
use
to
explain
to
you
and
we
see
that
with
the
difference
of
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature,
we
are
able
to
show ,
if
the
temperature
difference
between
the
dry
and
wet
bulb
is
6
degree,
and
if
the
dry
bulb
is
72
degree,
then
the
percent relative humidity is 54.
Instead
of
that
if
the
dry
bulb
would
have
been
88
degree,
then
this
way,
if
we
move,
it
is
61
right.
That
is
the
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
is
6
,remaining
constant,
and
the
dry
bulb
is
increasing
from
72
to
88,
then
the
relative
humidity
is
also
increasing
from
54
to
61
right.
Whereas,
if
it
is
the
reverse
way
then
at
60
percent
rather
64
degree
Fahrenheit
dry
bulb
temperature
the
relative
humidity
would
have
been
44
percent.
So,
the
lower
the
dry
bulb
temperature
lower
is
the
relative
humidity
of
course,
depending
on
the
difference
if
it
is
1
degree
difference
then
at
60
it
is
90
percent
relative
humidity
right
whereas,
at
88
degree
it
is
93
percent
relative
humidity
it
is
not
varying
so,
widely
1991,
91,
92,
92,
92,
93,
93
like
that
whereas,
if
the
difference
is
9
degree
then
at
60
degree
the
relative
humidity
is
20
percent
whereas,
at
80
degree
the
relative
humidity
is
45
higher
than
that
at
60
degree,
but
the
number
is
not
so
high
right.
So,
as
the
difference
between
them
is
increasing
the
relative
humidity
is
also
decreasing
right
because
here
one
we
have seen 90, 93 with 9, 20 and 9, 45.
So,
this
we
can
conclude
that
if
the
difference
between
the
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
is
high
then
the
relative
humidity
obtained
will
be
low
or
if
the
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
is
low
then
the
relative
humidity
value
obtained
will
be
also
very
high
right.
So,
this
is
what
we
conclude
from
this
we
conclude
from
this
table
right.
If
you
have
any
problem
you
can
definitely
call
me
or
contact
our
technical
assistance,but
hopefully
the
way
I
have
tried
my
best
to
make
you
understand
there
should
not
be
any
anything
which
is
not
told
or
which
you
have
not
been
able
to
understand
right.
So,
as
a
last
chance
last
time
I
repeat
that
you
have
on
the
left
column
the
difference
between
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
in
Fahrenheit
ranging
from
1
to
9
it
could
have
been
any
as
I
said
since
the
space
is
not
so
much.
So,
we
have
taken
only
9
and
on
the
afterward
we
have
taken
dry
bulb
temperatures
in
Fahrenheit
we
have
we
have
taken
a
range
of
60
to
88
degree
we
could
have
taken
60,
61,
62
like
that
then
the
space
requirement
would
have been very high which may be not be possible  to show in a table.
So,
we
have
done
60
to
88
degree
and
then
from
the
chart
we
have
found
out
that
if
the
difference
is
1
degree
dry
bulb
temperature
is
60
and
wet
bulb
temperature
is
59
1
degree
difference
then
the
relative
humidity
from
the
chart
came
out
to
be
6
the
90.
If
the
dry
bulb
temperature
is
88
with
a
1
degree
difference
of
dry
and
wet
bulb
temperature
the
relative
humidity
came
out
to
be
93
percent
this
is
one
extreme
another
extreme
is
if
we
take
the
difference
to
be
9
degree
then
at
60
degree
Fahrenheit
dry
bulb
temperature
the
relative
humidity
came
out
to
be
20
percent
whereas,
the
same
at
88
degree
Fahrenheit
the
relative
humidity
came
out
to
be
45
percent.
This
means
that
you
can
make
a
table
and
give
it
to
your
subordinate
in
the
company
where
your
associates
are
not
so
educated
and
they
can
easily
find
out
the
relative
humidity
from
the
table
ok.
So,
we
leave
this
now
other
definitions
are
humidity
ratio.
Humidity
ratio
is
the
kg
of
water
in
the
air
per
kg
of
dry
air
right
kg
of
water
in
air
per
kg
of
dry
air
is
the
humidity
ratio
it
is
ratio
both
are in kg right kg of water  in dry air to that kg of dry air right.
So,
the
common
unit
is
kg
water
per
kg
dry
air
that
is
how
it
is
expressed.
Then
comes
volume
the
volume
is
that
the
space
occupied
by
the
air
by
1
kg
of
dry
air
at
standard
temperature
and
pressure
in
meter
cube
the
volume
of
space
occupied
by
1
kg
of
air
I
should
not
say
dry
air
it
can
be
that
much
air
also.
The
volume
occupied
by
1
kg
of
air
at
standard
temperature
and
pressure
in
meter
cube
is
the
volume
and
the
last
one
is
the
enthalpy .
So,
enthalpy
we
know
we
have
come
across
till
now
a
lot
of
time
that
the
total
amount
of
heat
in
the
air
is
the
enthalpy .
This
includes
the
heat
to
raise
the
air
to
the
temperature and the heat required to vaporize  the water in the air .
So,
this
is
expressed
in
terms
of
joules
per
kg
of
dry
air
because
it
is
for
air
a
water
mixture.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
joules
per
kg
dry
air
kg
of
what
kg
of
dry
air
right.
So,
I
repeat
enthalpy
is
the
total
amount
of
heat
in
the
air
the
this
includes
the
heat
to
raise
the
air
to
the
temperature
and
the
heat
required
to
vaporize
the
water
in
the
air.
The
unit
is
in
joules
per
kg
dry
air.
So,
once
we
know
all
the
7
properties
by
definition
then
it
comes
what is that from where we will  find out this ok.
That
is
where
I
am
going
to
that
this
is
what
is
the
psychrometric
chart
right.
In
the
nextclass
we
will
obviously ,
explain
much
more
and
do
some
problems
also
right,
but
here
you
see
this
is
a
much
more
zoomed
one,
but
this
psychrometric
chart
is
a
function
of
pressure
also
here
you
see
it
is
written
clearly
at
sea
level
psychrometric
chart
at
sea
level.
So,
it
is
a
function
of
pressure.
So,
at
sea
level
whatever
is
the
psychrometric
chart
is
not
the
same
as
high
altitude
say
like
Kashmir
or
Ladakh
or
Darjeeling
or
Uty
or
similar
right.
So,
it
is
a
function
of
pressure
and
what
are
the
things
here
we
see
you
see
so
many
scales
there
is
one
scale
here
sorry
there
is
one
scale
here
that
is
this
scale
will
tell much in detail in the next class.
This
is
the
temperature
scale
all
temperatures
are
here
whether
dry
bulb,
wet
bulb
or
dew
point
only
you
have
to
know
how
it
has
to
be
read
right
and
there
is
also
a
vertical
scale
and
this
vertical
scale
is
known
as
humidity
ratio
or
normally
we
write
it
to
be
h
absolute
humidity
or
humidity
ratio
right.
Then
there
is
also
a
graph
like
this
is
called
the
saturation
line
on
the
left
side
there
is
another
scale
which
is
called
enthalpy
scale
right.
The
lines
like
this
are
the
enthalpy
lines
and
the
scale
is
known
as
enthalpy
scale.
Normally
the
volume
lines
like
this
are
there
and
some
other
lines
are
also
along
with
this
like
this
one
this
is
called
the
wet
bulb
line
right
this
is
called
wet
bulb
line.
Let
me
remove otherwise everything is becoming congested.
So,
this
is
called
wet
bulb
line.
So,
wet
bulb
line,
volume
line,
enthalpy
line,
humidity
line
and
the
temperature
lines
all
put
together
is
consisting
of
this
psychrometric
chart
right
all
these
are
constituting
the
psychrometric
chart.
So,
we
can
easily
determine
if
it
is
a
straight
point
say
if
this
is
a
straight
point
say
this
point
is
the
straight
point
how
did
you
how
can
you
find
out
by
knowing
the
two
property
values
out
of
the
7
by
two
property
values
you
can
come
to
this
point
right.
Similarly
you
can
find
out
another
set
another
straight
point
here
again
you
need
to
know
this
two
property
values
once
you
know
this
two
property
values
you
can
determine
the
other
property
values
from
this
straight
point
at
this
straight
point
of
course.
The
other
properties
values
will
be
corresponding to this straight point right.
How
to
do
it
I
hope
today
our
time
is
over
how
to
do
it
let
us
come
to
some.
So,
this
we
will
refer
today's
class
time
is
up.
So,
I
thank
you
all
for
the
for
attending
the
class.
Thank you so much.
