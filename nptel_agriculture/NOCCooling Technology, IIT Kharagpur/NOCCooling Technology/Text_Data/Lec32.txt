Dry Compr ession
Good
morning,
my
dear
friends
and
students.
Hopefully
you
have
gone
across
in
the
previous
class
why
Carnot
cycle
being
the
most
efficient
cycle
cannot
be
commercially
used,
what
are
the
difficulties
which
we
have
said
right.
And
hopefully
you
have
understood
we
have
repeatedly
said
why
it
is
not
able
to
use
in
the
commercials
level
right.
And
there
one
thing
came
out
that
it
was
because
one
of
the
reasons
were
that
it
was
because
of
the
wet
compression
right
and
because
of
the
wet
compression
the
feasibility
of
using
Carnot
cycle
became
very
difficult
or
is
not
possible.
Now
we
came
from
there
that
yes
if
there
is
a
dry
compression
right,
if
there
is
a
dry
compression
that
could
be
one
of
the
solutions
for
the
that
could
be
one
of
the
solutions
for
the
wet
compression
or
replacement
of
wet
compression
right.
So,
one
of
the
way
by
which
you
can
achieve
this
wet
compression
replacement
is
through
dry
compression
in
the
Carnot
refrigeration cycle.
So,
instead
of
wet
we
are
now
doing
dry
compression
right
and
dry
compression
also
we
said
that
means,
no
liquid
only
the
vapour
or
gas
is
to
be
compressed
right.
Then
that
we
said
that
liquid
droplets
heating
like
bullet
and
the
plunger
or
the
pistons
which
are
having
sheets
though
sheet
materials
are
not
getting
damaged
right.
So,
for
that
what
we
need?
We
need
one
isentropic
compression
and
one
isothermal
compression
and
this
is
shown
in
this
picture
right.
Here
we
are
doing
one
isentropic
compression
that
is
this
one
isentropic
compression
and
one
isothermal
this
one
is
from
there
and
then
as
we
did
from this isothermal expansion  that was is also done right.
So,
two
isentropic
compression
what
was
in
the
original
Carnot
cycle
that
now
if
we
are
replacing
with
one
isentropic
compression
and
one
isothermal
expansion
that
you
are
doing
right.
So,
you
see
that
pressures
here
the
pressure
is
p
1
that
is
what
p
e
right
and
here
it
is
p
i
intermediate
and
here
it
is
p
c.
So,
p
c
is
the
highest
and
p
i
is
the
intermediate
and
p
e
is
the
lowest
pressure.
So,
isentropic
compression
and
then
isothermal
compression
these
two
will
help
to
reach
the
one
which
we
had
seen
in
the
T-S
diagram
as
this
was
there
right.
So,
you
went
up
to
this
then
this
then
this
and
then
this.Now
instead
of
this
liquid
vapour
mixture
we
are
avoiding
we
are
coming
to
the
saturation
line.
So,
from
there
we
are
isentropically
compressing
it
to
the
point
2
and
for
then
from
the
point
2
to
point
3
we
are
compressing
isothermally
right
then
reaching
the
point
3
which
is
here.
So,
from
2
to
3
was
here
now
that
we
have
replaced
ok.
So,
this
is
one
good
suggestion
for
replacement
of
the
wet
compression
with
the
dry
compression.
For
that
as
we
said
that
we
need
two
compressors
and
those
two
compressors
are
shown
here as  this one right.
So,
that
is
doing
W
1
to
2
that
is
isentropic
compression
and
W
2
to
3
is
again
isothermal
compression
which
we
have
done
a
replacement
of
wet
compression
with
dry
compression,
but
we
need
one
and
two
compressors
right.
For
the
same
work
we
need
two
compressors
that
is
one
and
two
right
ok.
After
that
the
same
thing
happening
from
3
to
4
this
part
which
was
also
there
in
our
Carnot
system
that
3
to
4
this
was
isothermal
expansion
and
then
4
to
5
that
was
isentropic
compression
right.
So,
two
compressions
is
isentropic
and
two
isothermal
expansions
were
there
for
the
Carnot
system.
We
are
now
doing
one
isentropic
compression
and
one
isothermal
compression
and
in
that
we
are
using
two
compressors
right
and
other
all
remaining
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
Carnot
system right they are remaining same.
So,
this
is
a
dry
compression
and
that
is
called
Carnot
refrigeration
system
with
dry
compression.
So,
what
we
can
now
say
is
that
with
dry
compression
we
have
to
have
two
compressors.
Obviously
if
some
work
at
your
home
is
being
done
by
one
person
do
you
like
to
have
one
more
person
to
do
the
same
work
perhaps
not.
So,
here
also
that
difficulty
is
arising.
So,
as
we
are
seeing
in
that
figure
this
just
previous
figure
which
we
have
shown
the
Carnot
refrigeration
system
with
dry
compression
consists
of
one
isentropic
compression
and
that
is
point
1
to
2
or
state
point
1
to
2
from
evaporator
pressure
Pe
to
the
to
an
intermediate
pressure
Pi
and
temperature
remaining
Tc
followed
by
an
isothermal
compression
process
that
is
from
point
2
to
point
3
that
is
state
point
2
to
state
point
3
from
the
intermediate
pressure
Pi
to
the
condenser
pressure
Pc.
Though
with
this
modification
the
problem
of
wet
compression
is
avoided,
but
still
this
modified
system
is
not
practical
because
of
the
difficulty
in
achieving
number
one
true
isothermal
compression
and
using
high
speed
compressors
and
the
other
one
is
use
of
two
compressors
in
place
of
one
is
not
again
economically
justifiable
right.
So
that
the
fundamental
thing
you
see
when
you
are
compressing
right
when
you
are
compressing
a
gas
between
this
with
a
piston
that
what
is
happening
this
piston
is
coming
and
compressing
this
right.
So,
what
is
happening
the
pressure
here
was
say
Pe
and
here
the
pressure
say
Pi
according
to
our
this
modified
dry
compressor .
So
what
is
happening
the
pressure is increasing obviously , Pi is greater than Pe.So
pressure
is
increasing
the
moment
pressure
is
increasing
and
obviously ,
from
the
piston
you
see
the
volume
is
also
decreasing
from
whatever
volume
here
it
was
the
other
volume
at
Pi
at
this
point.
It
is
next
to
impossible
from
this
P
v
is
equal
to
RT
that
relation
keeping
change
both
P
and
V
keeping
T
constant
right.
So
keeping
T
constant
means
it
is
becoming
isothermal.
So
isothermal
compression
is
practically
very
very
difficult.
So
we
cannot
use
the
isothermal
compression
besides
using
two
compressors
is
also economically  not justifiable.
Then
what
happens?
Then
from
this
discussion
we
can
say
that
it
is
clear
that
from
practical
considerations
the
Carnot
refrigeration
system
need
to
be
modified
and
not
only
dry
compression
with
a
single
compressor
that
is
required.
If
the
isothermal
heat
rejection
process
if
the
isothermal
heat
rejection
process
is
replaced
by
isobaric
heat
rejection
process.
So
isobaric
heat
rejection
means
as
you
know
it
is
P
is
constant
right
that
is
the
isobaric.
So
under
constant
pressure
that
isothermal
heat
rejection
process
is
replaced
with
isobaric
heat
rejection
process.
If
this
can
be
done
one
another
change
that
is
the
isentropic
expansion
process
that
was
isentropic
expansion
process
was
if
you
remember
in
this
was
isentropic
expansion
right
from
point
3
to
point
4.
So
this
was
isentropic
expansion
process
and
that
can
be
replaced
by
an
isenthalpic
throttling
process.
So
that
means
enthalpy
H
is
constant.
So
if
these
two
are
done
or
replaced
achievable
then
a
refrigeration
system
which
incorporates
these
two
changes
is
known
as
Evans-Perkins
or
reverse
Rankine
cycle.
So
what
did
you
do?
We
have
replaced
one
isothermal
expansion
with
isobaric
expansion
or
heat
rejection
and
the
other
one
is
that
isentropic
expansion
was
also
replaced
by
isenthalpic
throttling
process
and
this
is
known
as
Evans-Perkins
or
reverse
Rankine
cycle.
This
is
the
theoretical
cycle
on
which
the actual vapour compression refrigeration system  is based on right.
So
what
we
can
do?
We
have
seen
it
that
one
isobaric
and
one
isenthalpic
these
two
process
we
have
to
incorporate
for
modification
of
the
Carnot
right.
Now
if
we
look
at
the
Carnot
efficiency
in
the
earlier
class
we
had
shown
you
also
that
Carnot
efficiency
if
we
take
a
problem
a
Carnot
heat
engine
operating
between
a
high
temperature
source
at
900
Kelvin
and
rejected
heat
to
a
low
temperature
reservoir
at
300
Kelvin
determine
the
thermal
efficiency
of
the
engine
number
1.
Now
if
the
temperature
of
the
high
temperature
source
is
decreased
incrementally
how
is
the
thermal
efficiency
changes
with
temperature?
This
problem
part
we
have
done
earlier
right.
Now
if
we
look
at
this
problem
that
we
have
found
out
yeeta
thermal
this
was
66.7
percent
this
we
have
done
earlier also.
Now
if
we
fix
T
L
at
300
Kelvin
and
lower
T
H
then
what
will
happen?
Yeeta
thermal
that
becomes
1
minus
300
by
T
H
right.
So
if
T
H
is
increased
then
this
ratio
is
decreased
that
means
1
minus
this
ratio
is
increased
that
means
yeeta
thermal
is
increased
right
thisis
true
and
we
can
we
can
show
it
from
here
that
yeeta
thermal
this
is
T
H
or
T
L
depending
on
which
one
you
are
taking
right.
So,
this
is
T
L.
So,
what
we
said
that
with
a
fixed
T
L
that
is
here
with
a
fixed
T
L.
So
here
we
take
the
T
H
or
thermal
efficiency
that is here if we increase T H then this  300 by T H that fraction reduces.
So,
1
minus
that
fraction
is
increased
that
means
yeeta
thermal
is
getting
increased
right.
So,
the
higher
the
temperature
the
higher
is
the
quality
of
the
energy
and
more
work
can
be
done
right
and
if
we
have
this
was
for
fixed
T
L.
Now
if
we
do
for
fixed
T
H
right
if
the
T
H
is
constant
at
900
Kelvin
and
we
increase
T
L
right.
So,
if
T
L
is
increased
then
this
ratio
is
decreasing
then
1
minus
this
ratio
that
is
increasing.
So,
yeeta
thermal
is
also
increasing right.
So,
this
is
900
and
this
say
was
300
say
now
you
made
it
to
600.
So,
this
ratio
when
it
was
300
it
was
1
by
3
that
is
0.3
when
you
made
it
600
then
it
is
2
by
3
right
it
is
0.6.
When you once again when  you increased when you keeping 900 constant it was 300.
So,
300
by
900
that
is
one
third
that
is
0.3.
So,
1
minus
0.3
is
0.7
right
whereas,
when
you made it 600.
So,
600
by
900
so
that
means
6
by
9
that
means
2
by
3
2
by
3
is
0.6
that
means
1
minus
0.6
is
0.4.
So,
it
is
decreasing
right
if
for
a
fixed
T
H
if
you
are
increasing
the
T
L
value
then  1 minus this is decreasing that means yeeta thermal is decreasing is it.
So,
T
H
like
that
and
this
we
have
also
said
earlier
right.
Now ,
the
question
then
comes
that
Carnot
efficiency
that
if
we
summarize
that
similarly
the
higher
the
temperature
of
the
low
temperature
sink
the
more
difficult
for
a
heat
exchange
engine
to
transfer
heat
into
it.
Thus
lower
thermal
efficiency
also
which
we
have
just
shown
right
sorry
which
we
have
just
shown
and
one
is
to
increase
the
thermal
efficiency
of
a
gas
power
turbine
one
would
like
to
increase
the
temperature
of
the
combustion
chamber .
However ,
that
sometimes
conflict
with
other
turbine
requirements
and
example
of
it
could
be
that
the
turbine
blades
cannot
withstand
high
temperature
gases.
So,
this
leads
to
early
fatigue
of
the blades.
Solution
could
be
better
material
that
can
be
found
out
or
research
can
be
done
on
that.
So
that
it
can
replace
them
or
innovative
cooling
that
design
can
be
incorporated
right.
So
this
is
the
second
third
one
is
work
is
in
general
more
valuable
compared
to
heat
since
work
can
since
work
can
convert
to
heat
almost
100
percent,
but
not
the
other
way
round
right.
Work
can
be
converted
almost
to
100
percent
to
heat,
but
heat
cannot
be
converted
100
percent
to
work
or
near
to
that.
So,
heat
becomes
useless
when
it
is
transferred
to
low
temperature
sources
because
the
thermal
efficiency
will
be
very
low
according
to
TH is equal to 1 minus T L over T H right that is the thermal ef ficiency .
So
it
says
that
when
heat
is
transferred
to
a
low
temperature
source
this
is
very
much
useless
because
the
thermal
efficiency
will
be
very
low
and
according
to
the
efficiency
definition
that
yeeta
thermal
is
equal
to
1
minus
T
L
over
T
h.
So,
this
is
why
there
is
a
little
incentive
to
extract
the
massive
thermal
energy
stored
in
the
oceans
and
lakes.
Yeah
every
you
hope
you
have
seen
ocean
and
every
second
you
have
seen
that
waves
are
coming
and
heating
right.
So,
the
question
comes
why
cannot
use
that
wave
energy.
So,
that
is
what
it
is
that
this
is
why
there
is
a
little
incentive
to
extract
the
massive
thermal
energy stored in the oceans or lakes right.
So,
with
this
our
time
is
up
today .
So,
we
have
concluded
the
Carnot
efficiency
and
also
shown
the
effect
of
the
high
that
is
high
temperature
or
low
temperature
on
the
Carnot
efficiency
right.
We
have
also
introduced
dry
compression
we
also
have
said
time
is
very
limited. So, let us tell it in  the next class. Thank you very much.
