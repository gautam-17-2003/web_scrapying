Types
and
Process
Description
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharwami.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology,
Kharagpur.
In
this
particular
module
we
will
continue
with
the
discussion
on
the
Aerobic
Waste
Water
Treatment
Systems
and
today
we
will
start
with
the
discussion
on
the
trickling
filter.
The
concepts
that
I
will
be
covering
today
is
the
overview
of
trickling
filter,
its
process
descriptions,
physical
descriptions
of
trickling
filter,
the
types
of
trickling
filter,
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
some
design
equations
and
one
numerical
as
well.
To
start
with
we
all
know
that
there
are
like
two
different
types
of
in
terms
of
attachment
of
bacteriological
parameters
and
also
we
have
attached
growth
biological
systems
and
biological
treatment
systems
and
suspended
growth
biological
treatment
system.
We
already
designed
one
suspended
growth
biological
treatment
system
that
is
what
activated
sludge
process.
So,
today
we
will
start
with
the
attached
growth
biological
treatment
system.
In
case
of
attached
growth
biological
treatment
system
it
can
also
be
subdivided
into
three
categories.
First
is
unsubmerged
attached
growth
where
the
fixed
bed
support
is
provided
and
the
bed
is
actually
stationary,
but
it
is
not
submerged
completely .
Then
we
have
submerged
attached
growth
process.
It
is
also
stationary
bed
and
the
fixed
bed
support
is
provided.
However,
the
whole
process
the
whole
growth
bed
is
in
submerged
condition.
And
the
third
one
is
the
moving
bed
attached
growth
process.
In
this
case
the
media
is
keep
on
moving
inside
the
reactor.
So,
there
is
one
example
I
will
share
you
in
like
you
know
in
next
to
next
slide
also
next
to
next
I
mean
like
the
lecture
module
also
lecture
material
also
it
is
about
the
moving
bed
bar
frame
reactor.
So,
there
you
will
get
to
know
about
this
moving
bed
attached
growth
systems
and
you
will
also
design
it
by
yourself
and
you
understand
how
it
performs.
So,
today
our
motto
is
to
understand
this
unsubmerged
attached
growth
reactor
which
is
also
known
as
the
trickling
filter.
So,
trickling
filter
it
is
a
type
of
unsubmerged
attached
growth
process
where
the
wastewater
is
distributed
from
the
top
of
the
filter
media
and
it
slowly
trickles
down.
So,
that
is
why
it
is
called
the
trickling
filter.
So,
you
can
see
in
this
picture
you
can
see
this
distribution
arms.
In
this
distribution
arms
the
wastewater
is
trickled
or
does
like
you
know
sprayed
over
the
surface
of
thisbiomedia.
And
this
biomedia
is
actually
a
useful
for
like
you
know
for
forming
the
micro
biofilm
layer
small
biofilm
slime
layer
on
top
of
it.
So,
this
biofilm
only
now
consume
let
us
start
consuming
the
organic
matter
present
in
the
wastewater
and
it
starts
growing
on
itself.
So,
this
what
is
happening
there?
There
are
this
wastewater
all
whenever
it
is
when
it
is
sprayed
over
the
top
of
this
biomedia
those
biofilm
present
in
the
biomedia
or
the
surface
of
this
biomedia
consume
those
nutrient
present
in
the
wastewater
and
by
the
time
it
will
reach
to
the
bottom
it
is
or
it
is
theoretically
there
are
will
be
some
amount
of
removal
of
organic
matter
nitrogen
phosphorus
etcetera.
We
will
discuss
about
it
in
more
in
detail.
So,
this
is
like
overall
picture
that
I
want
to
share
with
you
like
how
it
looks
like
and
this
biofilm
which
normally
comprises
it
is
majorly
the
active
aerobic
microorganism
of
bacteria
protozoa
fungi
and
also
it
major
role
is
to
remove
the
ammonia
or
the
nitrogen
compound
and
as
well
as
the
organic
matter
present
in
the
wastewater .
So,
if
you
see
the
physical
description
so,
in
general
what
are
the
different
components
that
it
has
first
one
is
the
filter
media.
Filter
media
is
you
can
see
in
the
middle
we
provide
the
filter
media
that
main
motto
is
to
provide
some
space
for
the
microorganism
to
grow
as
easy
as
that
you
understand.
So,
this
microorganism
will
start
growing
on
the
surface
of
this
biomedia
and
it
will
start
to
catalyze
the
oxidation
reaction
on
the
of
the
organic
matter
in
the
wastewater .
In
case
of
conventional
low
rate
and
high
rate
trickling
filter
this
filter
media
has
around
3
meter
of
a
media
depth.
In
case
of
super
rate
trickling
filter
we
will
discuss
about
all
these
things
low
rate
high
rate
as
well
as
the
super
rate
trickling
filter.
In
case
of
super
rate
trickling
filter
the
media
depth
is
around
8
millimeter
8
meter
and
with
the
minimum
clearance
of
15
centimeter
has
to
be
provided
in
the
distribution
arms
because
this
rotary
distribution
arms
it
spread
the
wastewater
on
top
of
this
filter
media.
The
gap
between
this
top
surface
of
this
filter
media
and
the
spraying
nozzle
of
individual
distribution
arms
this
should
be
the
gap
should
be
at
least
15
centimeter
ok.
Now,
this
rotary
distributor
systems
rotary
distribution
system
is
nothing,
but
it
consists
of
a
central
feeder
pipe
and
then
supports
two
or
more
horizontal
arms
with
a
number
of
nozzles
through
which
the
wastewater
is
sprayed
over
the
surface
of
this
filter
media
ok.
Now
there
is
this
under
drainage
system
you
can
see
in
the
bottom
there
is
this
under
drainage
system.
It
has
a
couple
of
purposes
first
of
all
it
is
all
the
after
the
treated
wastewater
is
treated
that
wastewater
it
carries
along
with
it
along
other
than
that
it
also
carries
the
solid
which
discharge
from
the
filter
media
because
what
is
happening
in
the
filter
media
with
time
the
bioprimes
start
growing.
So,
when
it
start
growing
after
certain
millimeter
of
depth
what
happened
after
certain
millimeter
of
depth
what
will
happen
it
will
the
outer
layer
will
keep
on
going,
but
inside
layer
they
will
die.
So,
with
time
once
the
inside
layer
they
will
start
dying
they
come
out
of
the
surface
of
thisbiomedia.
So,
this
phenomena
is
called
the
slogging
of
phenomena.
So,
this
biomedia
when
it
come
out
of
this
surface
this
slime
layer
you
will
see
taken
one
small
slime
layers
like
structure
it
will
come
out
of
the
surface
and
it
comes
at
a
as
a
as
a
grow
structure.
So,
it
will
directly
go
inside
go
in
the
bottom
in
the
under
drainage
system
we
collect
those
slogged
of
biomedia
slogged
of
biofilm
and
that
also
carries
by
in
the
in
the
secondary
in
the
next
step
in
the
clarifier
we
collect
those
this
biomass
and
we
easily
dispersed
it
as
a
sludge.
Another
very
important
job
that
it
performs
is
the
ventilation
system
because
of
certain
gap
that
it
provide
that
we
provide
on
the
under
drainage
system
in
the
bottom
it
provides
some
ventilation
to
the
filter
in
order
to
maintain
the
free
air
circulation
in
for
the
aerobic
environment
to
prevail
ok.
So,
in
general
the
floor
of
the
under
drainage
system
has
to
have
at
least
1
to
5
percent
of
slope
towards
the
main
drainage
channel
and
with
a
minimum
velocity
of
0.6
meter
per
second
to
avoid
the
deposition
of
this
slogged
biofilm
ok.
So,
it
should
the
biofilm
should
keep
on
coming
in
the
bottom
and
hopper
bottom
like
structure.
So,
from
there
the
main
effluent
channel
is
there
from
there
we
collect
the
this
biomass
and
then
slogged
biomass
and
we
simply
separated
in
the
next
system
in
the
clarifier
and
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank
called
clarifier.
So,
what
are
the
different
types
of
trickling
filter?
First
to
start
with
the
low
rate
or
high
rate
trickling
filter
and
then
the
super
rate
trickling
filter
is
there.
So,
what
is
low
rate
or
high
rate
trickling
filter
as
you
can
see
in
this
picture
in
this
low
rate
simply
we
have
trickling
filter
then
we
have
a
secondary
sedimentation
tank
to
collect
the
sludges
to
like
you
know
sediment
all
the
slogged
biomass.
Then
the
effluent
will
the
super
rate
will
go
out
it
comes
as
effluent.
In
case
of
high
rate
trickling
filter
what
happened
the
after
the
effluent
trickling
filter
process
the
some
amount
of
effluent
is
we
are
returning
and
again
after
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank
also
whatever
the
sludge
is
there
the
sludge
also
we
some
portion
of
the
sludge
is
actually
we
return
it
back
to
the
primary
sedimentation
tank
for
and
for
further
treatment
and
from
there
the
sludge
is
actually
collected
for
in
the
digester
in
the
collected
for
the
sludge
handling
units
and
all.
So,
in
this
case
this
is
called
the
high
rate
trickling
filter
and
also
further
treatment
efficiency
is
quite
high
quite
efficient
in
case
of
high
rate
trickling
filter
systems.
In
general
the
circulation
it
helps
in
providing
the
seeding
to
the
filter
bed
during
the
initial
startup
and
during
the
normal
operation
also
it
in
case
normal
operation
it
also
dilutes
the
organic
matter
concentration
in
the
influent
waste
water
by
which
actually
it
helps
actually
to
for
like
you
know
to
reduce
the
influent
BOD
load
and
which
is
the
one
of
the
major
limitation
in
case
of
trickling
filter.
So,
that
is
why
the
super
rate
high
rate
technique
filter
operates
much
with
much
better
efficacy.
Then
there
comes
the
super
rate
technique
filter
or
the
roughing
filter
or
famously
known
as
bio
tower
ok.If
you
see
now
it
is
bio
tower
is
most
prominently
used
this
word
is
most
prominently
used
then
the
super
rate
trickling
filter.
So,
what
is
happening
there
we
when
we
have
a
organic
load
of
more
than
1.6
kg
of
BOD
per
meter
cube
per
day
we
normally
provide
this
kind
of
structure
bio
tower.
In
case
of
bio
tower
what
is
happening
what
is
you
can
see
this
picture
both
the
picture
the
in
case
of
low
rate
or
high
rate
trickling
filter
we
are
not
providing
any
external
means
of
air
circulation
we
just
make
some
space
in
the
bottom
ok
that
is
it
and
on
the
top
that
is
it.
So,
basically
from
here
we
have
a
exhaust
fan
which
purposefully
pulls
the
air
through
the
system
and
there
is
a
vent
provided
on
the
both
the
side
like
I
mean
like
the
on
its
peripheral
region.
So,
through
which
the
air
will
enter
air
will
enter
and
it
will
pass
through
those
biomedia
and
reaches
to
the
top.
So,
because
of
that
there
is
a
active
aeration
taking
place
because
of
this
active
aeration
the
it
generates
its
maintains
the
aerobic
environment
inside
the
trickling
filter
ok.
Another
type
of
system
is
there
you
can
see
in
the
next
one
this
3B
in
this
figure
there
is
in
the
in
the
in
the
in
the
peripheral
structure
of
it
there
is
blower
placed
in
the
bottom.
So,
this
blower
it
blows
the
air
it
takes
the
air
from
outside
and
blows
it
inside
and
the
air
will
and
there
is
a
vent
on
the
top
and
through
which
the
water
the
air
will
pass
through
this
biomedia
it
will
reach
to
the
atmosphere.
So,
this
way
in
either
of
this
configurations
are
useful
for
making
it
a
bio
tower
considering
it
at
a
bio
tower
or
super
rate
trickling
filter.
It
normally
has
a
diameter
of
around
3
to
70
meter
with
a
air
blower
or
exhaust
fan
in
it
and
there
is
a
normally
in
case
of
absence
of
external
air
circulation
normally
we
provide
the
shallow
depth,
but
in
case
of
artificial
air
draft
it
can
be
constructed
up
to
12
meter
depth
with
a
5
to
8
meter
typically
adapted
depth.
The
synthetic
material
such
as
plastic
modules
can
be
used
for
filter
media
as
it
provide
high
specific
surface
area,
high
void
ratio
and
low
density
on
which
the
biofilm
can
be
formed.
In
this
kind
of
plastic
media
interlocking
plastic
surfaces
are
arranged
to
produce
a
honeycomb
like
structure
which
is
highly
porous
clog
resistance
and
this
permits
the
application
of
higher
organic
and
the
hydraulic
loading
rates
of
this
type
of
filters.
In
case
let
us
discuss
about
more
in
details
majorly
the
mechanisms
like
flocculation
and
sedimentation
in
the
void
of
this
bed
material
also
assist
in
overall
treatment
process.
This
diameter
of
this
trickling
filter
it
depends
on
the
mechanical
rotary
distributor
we
used
for
spraying
the
waste
water
on
the
top
commonly
more
than
12
meter
for
single
filter
unit.
In
case
of
rotary
arm
when
it
rotates
it
is
a
result
of
the
jet
reaction.
What
do
you
mean
by
the
jet
reaction
means
suppose
it
is
rotating
like
this
over
a
single
point.
Because
what
happens
is
it
act
like
a
lever
action
and
what
happen
when
the
water
will
move
from
say
one
direction
from
the
right
hand
side
arm
in
the
left
hand
side
arm
say
it
ismoving
from
the
opposite
direction.
So,
what
will
happen
it
will
literally
because
of
the
Newton's
third
law
it
will
put
a
additional
jet
action
on
the
top
on
the
arm
because
the
arms
are
almost
free
moving.
So,
it
will
move
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
flow
of
water.
Like
you
know
spray
the
side
from
which
the
your
spraying
action
is
going
taking
place.
So,
because
of
that
it
takes
it
is
naturally
it
started
rotating
on
the
top
of
this
things
because
of
this
jet
action.
So,
you
do
not
have
to
provide
any
additional
means
of
rotor
or
motion
like
energy
sources
to
move
that
arm
move
the
arms
of
this
distribution
channels.
So,
then
this
in
general
this
technique
filter
with
the
small
diameter
of
less
say
less
than
6
meter
we
normally
provide
the
power
driven
rotary
arms.
In
case
of
it
is
more
than
that
we
do
not
provide
it
happens
naturally
using
the
jet
action.
In
order
to
avoid
the
filter
clogging
a
maximum
specific
surface
area
of
100
square
meter
per
meter
cube
is
recommended
for
carbonaceous
viewed
removal
and
up
to
300
meter
square
per
meter
cube
for
nitrification
also
if
you
want
to
also
go
ahead
with
the
nitrification
process.
Because
the
nitrifiers
are
slow
having
a
very
slow
growth
rate
ok.
The
overall
performance
of
the
trickling
filter
it
depends
upon
the
hydraulic
and
the
organic
loading
rate
applied
wastewater
pH
operating
temperature
and
air
availability
through
the
natural
draft
within
the
pores
and
mean
time
of
contact
of
wastewater
with
biofilm.
The
mean
time
of
contact
is
related
to
the
filter
depth
applied
hydraulic
loading
rate
and
the
nature
of
filter
packing.
The
contact
time
in
general
it
is
estimated
by
the
equation
1
where
t
is
the
mean
detention
time,
d
is
the
depth
of
filter
bed
and
q
is
the
hydraulic
loading
rate
in
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
and
C
and
n
are
the
constants
ok.
Please
remember
this
equation
it
will
be
useful
for
us
write
it
down
it
will
be
useful
for
us
in
coming
slides
t
equal
to
C
t
by
q
to
the
power
n
for
finding
out
the
mean
detention
time
ok.
To
understand
more
about
the
process
biology
what
is
happening
in
general
the
wastewater
trickles
down
through
this
filter
media
and
this
biological
slime
layer
is
developed
on
the
surface
of
this
filter
media.
This
biofilm
which
is
formed
over
the
media
surfaces
it
consists
of
microorganism
responsible
for
biodegradation
of
organic
matter.
The
major
population
of
this
biofilm
over
this
slime
layer
which
form
just
right
next
to
the
bio
biomedia
they
are
majorly
aerobic
anaerobic
or
facultative
nature
ah
bacteria
ah
other
than
that
algae,
fungus,
protozoa,
rotifiers,
snails,
flies,
worms
can
also
be
there
because
of
its
favorable
condition
that
we
provide.
Usually
usually
up
to
a
depth
of
0.1
to
0.2
millimeter
of
slime
layer
can
have
the
aerobic
properties
beyond
this
the
aerobic
anaerobic
zone
started
developing
0.1
to
0.2
millimeter
not
more
than
that
ok.
And
insufficient
food
and
limited
oxygenability
lead
to
the
microorganisms
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
in
the
state
of
starvation.
So,
what
will
happen
when
the
lower
portion
I
mean
like
the
outer
layer
it
still
has
some
food,
but
the
lower
portion
it
does
not
penetrate
that
food
and
also
it
started
growing
like
old.
So,
what
will
happen
this
slime
layer
it
becomes
thicker
and
with
time
it
completely
get
out
of
this
surface
I
mean
like
get
they
die
and
they
get
out
of
this
surface
like
in
along
with
the
fresh
biofilm
as
well.
So,
this
is
called
the
this
is
called
the
slogging
phenomena
as
I
told
you.
This
slogged
biomass
is
removed
from
the
system
via
this
under
drain
system
and
it
subsequently
removed
in
the
clarifier
by
settling
ok.
So,
this
is
how
the
process
looks
like.
So,
how
nitrification
is
taking
place
nitrification
can
be
achieved
in
the
triggering
filter
when
operated
at
low
organic
loading
rate
and
suitable
temperature.
The
process
gets
initiated
at
a
BOD
concentration
less
than
20
milligram
per
liter
and
also
the
total
nitrogen
removal
efficiency
of
up
to
35
percent
can
be
achieved
in
the
trickling
filter
systems.
And
nutrient
removal
efficiency
of
treatment
filters
depends
on
the
operating
conditions
like
high
removal
of
ammonia
and
no
capacity
of
trickling
filter
for
nutrient
removals
it
depends
like
you
know
different
condition
operating
conditions
and
all.
Sludge
retention
the
sludge
which
is
retained
in
the
trickling
filter
for
very
long
time
as
compared
to
the
activated
sludge
process
typically
the
mean
cell
residence
time
of
almost
100
years
or
100
days
or
more
can
be
easily
achieved.
And
sludge
generation
in
the
trickling
filter
is
generally
60
to
70
percent
lower
than
the
ASP
treating
the
same
wastewater .
Because
in
ASP
the
sludge
generation
is
quite
high
the
amount
of
organic
matter
which
converted
into
the
biomass
is
quite
high,
but
in
case
of
sludge
which
is
generated
in
the
over
the
top
of
trickling
filter
I
mean
like
the
here
also
actually
theoretically
speaking
the
biomass
the
conversion
is
almost
the
happens
in
the
same
procedure,
but
what
happened
it
keeps
on
like
you
know
like
you
know
generating
the
slime
layer
on
the
top
of
this
biomedia
and
there
are
huge
number
of
biomedia
with
a
huge
number
of
specific
surface
area.
So,
it
takes
time
for
the
bioprim
to
actually
reach
to
that
state
when
it
will
be
considered
as
sludge
and
then
you
get
rid
of
those
things
ok.
So,
the
sludge
generation
process
is
quite
low
in
case
of
trickling
filter
compared
to
the
ASP.
Air
supply
in
case
of
low
rate
or
high
rate
trickling
filter
the
natural
air
draft
is
used
through
the
filter
bed
which
is
responsible
for
the
air
supply,
but
in
case
of
super
speed
super
in
case
of
say
like
in
a
super
air
trickling
filter
what
is
happening
there
the
you
are
applying
some
artificial
additional
means
of
air
supply
either
through
a
blower
from
the
bottom
or
from
the
blower
from
the
top
I
mean
like
fan
from
the
top
you
can
have
those
air
circulation
additional
air
circulation
on
the
biomedia
bed
ok.
This
design
values
as
recommended
for
the
design
of
different
type
of
trickling
filter
see
low
rate
high
rate
and
for
the
superrate
trickling
filter
and
the
hydraulic
loading
rate
what
it
should
be
the
depth
the
volumetric
loading
rate
the
recirculation
ratio
the
power
requirement
the
dosing
interval
the
slugging
of
phenomena
and
the
effluent
quality.
So,
all
these
things
actually
will
vary
and
I
will
request
you
to
please
go
through
this
slide
again
and
please
write
it
down
in
your
notebook
to
have
a
overall
idea
that
which
type
of
trickling
filter
is
more
efficient
in
which
type
of
in
general
obviously,
the
super
rate
trickling
filters
are
most
the
best
performing
one,
but
it
comes
with
certain
economic
advantages
and
also
because
it
involves
the
additional
you
have
to
employ
some
additional
power
because
of
the
blowers
and
all
that
you
need
to
install.
Anyway
so,
about
the
detailing
about
the
rotary
arm
in
general
it
rotates
with
a
very
slow
rotational
speed
of
0.5
to
2
rpm
that
means,
0.5
to
2
rotation
revolution
or
rotation
per
minute
you
can
imagine
how
slow
it
is
ok.
The
peripheral
speed
of
this
two
arms
will
be
0.5
to
4
meter
per
minute
not
more
than
that
the
arm
length
could
be
as
low
as
3
meter
and
as
high
as
35
meter
depending
on
the
diameter
of
the
filter
bed.
The
rotary
arm
delivers
the
waste
water
about
15
centimeter
above
the
filter
bed
as
I
already
discussed
and
the
velocity
should
be
more
than
0.3
meter
per
second
to
prevent
the
deposition
of
solid
inside
this
rotary
arm
ok,
thus
inside
those
nozzles.
Minimum
two
arms
are
provided
obviously,
two
in
order
to
counterbalance
each
other
and
then
if
you
can
have
more
like
instead
of
4,
6,
8
number
of
arms.
In
general
if
you
see
the
guidelines
it
is
given
in
the
table
1.
What
are
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
trickling
filter?
The
major
advantages
are
it
can
be
operated
under
a
wide
range
of
organic
and
hydraulic
loading
rates.
It
can
resist
to
the
shock
loading
it
is
one
of
the
best
thing
about
the
trickling
filter
that
it
can
resist
the
shock
loading
whereas,
activated
sludge
process
it
cannot
resist
the
it
cannot
it
started
performing
poorly
when
there
is
a
shock
load
ok.
There
is
a
certain
problem
you
start
facing
a
lot
of
issues
when
it
is
a
there
is
a
certain
organic
shock
happening
organic
shock
load
is
taking
place
inside
the
in
the
inside
the
treatment
plant.
In
general
it
is
more
efficient
nitrification
can
be
achieved
with
a
low
organic
loading
rate
and
high
effluent
quality
in
terms
of
BOD
and
suspended
solid
removal
low
power
requirement
and
not
land
intensive
treatment
system
as
compared
to
the
stimulation
points
and
all.
However,
it
is
quite
intensive
compared
to
the
activated
sludge
process.
High
capital
cost
which
is
one
of
the
major
disadvantage
the
additional
treatment
may
be
required
to
meet
the
better
discharge
standards.
It
requires
the
expert
design
and
constructions
requires
constant
source
of
wastewater
flow
and
regular
monitoring
the
major
problem
is
vector
and
order
of
are
the
major
problem
in
the
nearby
for
the
nearby
like
people
who
are
living
in
the
farming
and
plantarea.
Pre-treatment
of
wastewater
is
necessary
and
obviously,
the
unit
to
supply
it
need
to
pass
it
through
the
primary
setting
primary
treatment
units
and
the
risk
of
clogging
is
relatively
high
which
can
drastically
cause
a
huge
problem
to
your
systems
and
air
to
do
the
air
flushing
is
possible
or
water
flushing
back
flushing
is
possible,
but
it
requires
huge
amount
of
bulk
amount
of
water
to
do
this
kind
of
a
job.
So,
some
issues
are
there
which
needs
to
be
we
need
to
tackle
it.
The
design
formulation
of
trickling
filter
have
been
given
by
several
famous
scientists
like
NRC
formulas,
sludge
formulas
and
they
can
filter
formulas
and
all.
So,
in
general
in
formula
to
calculate
the
rotational
speed
of
rotary
distributor
is
given
by
equation
2
n
=
(1
+
R
)(
q
)
(10
3
mm/m)
/
NA
)(
DR
)(60
min/h)
whereas,
this
R
is
nothing,
but
the
recycle
ratio
q
is
the
influent
hydraulic
loading
rate
in
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
hour
N
a
is
the
number
of
arms
in
the
rotary
distributor
assembly
and
d
r
is
the
dosing
rate
in
millimeter
of
per
pass
of
the
distributor
arms.
So,
it
will
give
you
the
value
of
N
in
rpm
rotational
speed
in
rpm.
The
NRC
formula
for
design
of
trickling
filter
suppose
you
have
a
fast
edge
filter
where
this
NRC
equation
from
is
given
by
equation
3
So,
whereas,
this
E
1
is
the
efficiency
of
BOD
removal
in
fast
edge
filter
at
20
degree
Celsius
including
recirculation
and
sedimentation
whereas,
in
percentage
and
L
is
nothing,
but
the
BOD
loading
at
to
the
filter
in
kg
of
BOD
per
day
and
V
is
the
volume
of
the
filter
media
and
in
meter
cube
and
f
is
the
recirculation
factor
which
can
be
easily
find
out
by
this
equation
3
which
is
given
as
Recirculation
factor
F
=
1
+
R
/(1
+
0.1
R
)
2
So,
this
R
is
the
recirculation
ratio.
In
case
of
2
stage
trickling
filter
the
equation
becomes
whereas,
this
E
2
is
the
efficiency
of
BOD
removal
in
second
stage
of
treatment
second
stage
trickling
filter
at
20
degree
Celsius
and
E
1
is
the
efficiency
of
BOD
removal
in
the
first
stage
and
L
2
is
the
BOD
loading
rate
in
the
second
stage
filter.
So,
with
this
equation
we
can
easily
calculate
with
this
calculate
the
efficiency
of
the
BOD
removal
in
first
stage
and
second
stage
filters.
We
can
use
the
Rankine's
formula
also
in
using
the
Rankine's
formula
the
BOD
to
the
BOD
of
influent
of
the
filter
shall
not
exist
3
times
the
BOD
required
for
certain
effluent.
So,
in
this
case
this
is
the
only
criteria
here
we
can
it
can
be
easily
expressed
by
equation
5
or
equation
6
is
nothing,
but
or
whereas,
S
2
is
the
BOD
of
settled
effluent,
S
4
is
the
BOD
of
trickling
filter
effluent
after
SST
and
R
1
is
the
recirculation
ratio
and
E
is
the
efficiency
of
BOD
removal.
So,
it
can
again
be
written
like
expressed
like
in
equation
7
whereas,
this
R
is
nothing
R
is
the
value
of
recirculation
which
can
be
easily
calculated
by
Q
t
minus
Q
by
Q.
So,
Q
t
is
what
total
flow
including
the
recirculation
Q
is
the
wastewater
flow
that
needs
to
be
treated.
In
case
of
second
stage
second
stage
filter
the
same
equation
like
in
this
the
the
condition
can
be
represented
by
equation
9
and
equation
10
whereas,
the
S
6
if
you
see
whereas,
S
4
is
the
BOD
of
effluent
ah,
influent
in
the
second
stage
filter
and
S
6
is
the
effluent
of
BOD
of
second
stage
ah,
trickling
filter
after
SST
and
R
2
is
the
recirculation
ratio.
So,
equations
are
very
easy
it
is
a
very
easy
formula
this
Rankine's
formula
once
you
know
those
numbers
ah,
you
can
easily
get
the
value
of
the
unknown
ones
ok.
In
case
of
Ekenfeld's
formula
it
is
developed
by
the
Ekenfeld's
in
1961
for
filter
performance
while
treating
the
municipal
wastewater
the
second
order
reaction
kinetics
is
followed
while
developing
the
kinetics.
So,
the
equation
will
become
remember
this
is
different
to
the
first
order
or
the
pseudo
first
order
in
first
order
or
pseudo
first
order
ds
by
dt
is
equal
to
minus
equal
to
minus
ks
or
equal
to
ks,
but
in
this
case
is
the
second
order
equation.
So,
it
follows
the
equation
11.
So,
whereas,
this
x
is
the
mass
of
organism
present
in
the
filter
bit
capital
S
is
the
BOD
concentration
k
is
the
reaction
rate
constant
and
integrating
this
to
ah,
with
time
0
to
t
and
solving
the
equation
11
we
will
get
the
equation
number
12
the
So,
it
is
you
can
substitute
So,
please
remember
that
this
c
is
can
be
ah,
it
is
nothing,
but
ah,
it
is
a
kind
of
a
you
can
the
first
c
in
the
after
the
equation
12
the
when
you
calculate
the
substitute
it
with
the
t
you
can
easily
calculate
all
those
constant
S
0
k
x
and
also
the
c
you
can
put
all
these
things
in
a
same
constant
c
and
the
equation
will
become
equation
12
will
become
ah,
as
you
can
see
from
the
equation
13
So,
whereas,
this
ah
S
t
is
the
BOD
5
of
the
effluent
in
milligram
per
liter
S
0
is
the
BOD
of
the
influent
in
milligram
per
liter
c
is
the
constant
typical
value
is
5.358
and
or
you
will
be
given
in
the
in
any
problem
or
you
have
to
find
out
ah,
with
the
known
ah,
parameters
and
d
is
the
filter
depth
which
is
provided
in
meter
and
ql
is
the
hydraulic
loading
rate
per
unit
area
of
the
bed
in
meter
square
per
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
Later
on
this
Echelfinter
he
has
also
again
developed
a
performance
equation
of
specific
rate
of
substrate
removal
using
the
pseudo
first
order
reaction
as
well.
If
it
is
like
In
this
case
ah,
the
this
1
by
x
into
dx
by
dt
represents
the
specific
rate
of
substrate
utilization
that
is
mass
of
substrate
divided
by
microbial
mass
into
time.
dS
by
dt
is
the
rate
of
substrate
utilization
only
and
k
is
the
rate
constant
and
S
is
the
substrate
concentration
in
mass
per
volume.
So,
if
you
rearrange
this
equation
number
14
for
ah,
the
you
integrate
it.
So,
it
will
become
So,
because
this
k
is
a
average
cell
mass
concentration
in
mass
per
volume
and
S
0
is
the
substrate
concentration
applied
over
the
ah,
filter
bed
that
is
resulting
after
recirculation
and
S
t
is
the
substrate
concentration
over
time.
If
you
integrate
it
the
you
will
get
this
following
equation
in
the
equation
16
which
is
Where
this
x
is
the
proportional
to
the
surface
area
of
the
media
ok,
which
is
almost
ah,
equal
ok.
And
this
main
contact
time
t
in
this
filter
bed
is
given
by
this
Holland's
equation
where
ah,
in
the
equation
1
if
you
remember
we
did
it
in
the
very
beginning
ah,
in
this
equation
1
if
you
remember
ok,
t
equal
to
C
t
by
q
into
n
ok.
Please
you
remember
this
equation
t
equal
to
C
t
by
q
into
n.
So,
q
to
the
power
n.
So,
we
will
use
this
equation
here
in
the
equation
number
12
and
we
will
replace
the
no
sorry
we
will
use
it
in
the
equation
number
ah,
16
we
will
replace
it
with
it
and
we
will
become
we
will
get
the
equation
number
17.
Whereas
this
ah,
m
this
A
S
to
the
power
m
this
m
is
a
constant
ah,
specific
to
the
media
configuration
and
type
of
wastewater
being
treated
and
the
value
of
it
can
be
experimentally
determined
and
similarly
the
value
of
n
which
is
q
l
to
the
power
n,
n
depends
on
the
flow
characteristics.
So,
the
packing
and
the
usually
the
value
is
around
0.5
to
0.67.
For
specific
wastewater
and
filter
media
equation
17
can
further
be
simplified
ah,
by
you
know
combining
k
A
S
and
m
into
1
constant
k
and
it
will
become
and
this
value
of
k
t
can
be
easily
find
out
if
you
know
the
k
20
value
ah,
k
t
is
equal
to
k
20
into
1.35
that
is
the
temperature
correction
factor
to
the
power
t
minus
20.
With
the
same
we
have
done
it
for
the
in
case
of
BOD
modeling
also
in
we
have
used
the
same
formula
for
ah,
in
airation
airation
ah,
system
design
as
well.
So,
temperature
coefficient
is
like
you
know
correction
factor
From
there
you
can
easily
get
the
value
of
k
t
at
any
particular
temperature.
So,
now,
we
have
a
very
good
idea
about
ah,
the
different
equations
different
modeling
that
we
can
be
can
be
used
in
trickling
filter.
So,
let
us
solve
one
problem
ah,
for
design
problem.
So,
it
will
be
easier
for
us
to
understand
the
whole
concept.
So,
let
us
design
a
low
rate
trickling
filter.
So,
design
a
low
rate
trickling
filter
for
secondary
treatment
of
sewage
generated
from
a
residual
academic
campus
with
a
population
of
30000
residents
with
a
rate
of
water
supplies
130
LPCD
liter
per
capita
per
day.
You
know
LPCD
right
liter
per
capita
per
day
of
uses
ok.
And
the
BOD
5
of
after
pre
treatment
primary
treatment
is
110
milligram
per
liter
and
BOD
5
of
final
effluent
should
be
less
than
or
equal
to
20
milligram
per
liter
the
value
of
C
is
also
given.
If
you
remember
we
can
we
can
use
the
equation,
if
you
remember
this
equation
we
can
use
it
So,
from
here
you
already
know
let
us
say
the
let
us
take
the
value
of
D
is
around
0.1.5.
So,
average
sewage
flow
we
can
easily
calculate
because
the
total
number
of
resident
in
your
city
is
30000.
So,
total
number
of
water
that
you
supply
total
amount
of
water
that
you
are
supplying
per
capita
per
per
per
day
is
170
liter.
So,
170
liter
2
you
can
convert
it
into
meter
cube,
but
multiplying
it
with
10
to
the
power
minus
3.
Then
whatever
the
water
you
are
you
know
you
are
supplied
with
there
is
a
general
thumb
rule
that
80
percent
of
that
water
actually
goes
out
from
your
household
as
a
waste
water
ok.
So,
as
for
it
connects
with
your
sewerage
line.
So,
I
mean
like
it
goes
to
as
a
sewage
and
it
connects
with
it
goes
to
your
sewerage
line
to
the
treatment
plant.
So,
80
percent
of
your
total
water
supply
so
that
means,
water
total
water
supply
is
170
into
170
into
10
to
the
power
minus
3
into
30000
multiplied
by
0.8
you
will
get
the
total
average
sewage
that
is
being
generated.
Average
sewage
flow
=
30,000×
170×
0.80×
10
–3
=
4080
m
3
/day
So,
what
is
that
value
it
is
around
4080
meter
cube
per
day
ok.
Now
what
you
need
to
do
you
just
simply
solve
this
this
S
t
is
given
to
you
final
effluent
final
effluent
BOD
should
be
20
initial
effluent
BOD
is
how
much
110
milligram
per
liter
you
C
is
given
to
you
5.358
a
D
is
given
to
you
1.5
you
need
to
find
out
the
value
of
Q
L
right.
So,
value
of
Q
L
if
you
solve
this
equation
you
will
get
2.441
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
So,
what
will
be
the
total
plan
plan
plan
area
required
for
the
trickling
filter
we
know
that
flow
rate
is
sewage
flow
is
=
1671.45
m
24 0 8 02.4 4 1
So,
you
will
get
the
area
as
1671.45
square
meter
so
that
means,
meter
square
so
that
means,
the
the
area
of
your
plane
area
through
at
which
the
you
know
your
waste
water
needs
to
be
sprayed
should
be
1671
meter
square.
So,
what
will
be
the
diameter
required
for
your
trickling
filter
you
just
simply
calculate
it
like
you
know
from
the
equation
pi
r
square
or
pi
D
square
by
4
from
there
you
can
easily
calculate
the
diameter
the
D
value
will
come
as
46.14
ok.
So,
either
you
can
have
the
single
filter
with
a
diameter
of
46.14
or
you
can
have
2
rate
filter
with
each
having
a
diameter
of
32.65
you
just
simply
divided
by
16.71
divided
by
2
and
then
make
it
you
know
you
know
into
2
difference
trickling
filter
you
can
easily
calculate
the
diameter
and
so
that
you
know
the
diameter
and
you
know
the
depth
you
have
chosen
at
1.5
meter
that
is
it
your
design
is
done
and
so
now,
you
put
up
a
certain
amount
of
biomedia
percentage
wise
and
then
you
calculate
the
design
the
rest
of
the
portions
like
you
know
the
rotary
arms
and
all
this
things
ok.
So,
this
is
how
you
can
easily
design
the
low
rate
trickling
filter
ok
very
good.
So,
we
had
a
very
good
discussion
about
the
trickling
filter
and
we
I
hope
we
understood
the
trickling
filter
in
depth
and
so
that
we
can
use
it
in
you
know
I
mean
like
you
can
actually
design
it
by
yourself
in
future
ok.
So,
in
conclusion
we
discussed
about
the
trickling
filter
physical
structure
we
discussed
about
the
operational
aspects
types
and
configurations
the
benefits
of
bio
tower
and
the
biological
mechanism
that
involves
and
what
are
these
advantages
and
disadvantages
and
that
we
also
get
to
know
that
it
has
very
good
for
wide
range
of
loading
rate
it
can
resist
to
the
shock
load
and
it
has
a
efficient
nitrification
and
the
low
power
requirement
ok.
So,
that
is
very
good
for
us
to
here.
So,
these
are
the
paper
that
I
would
request
paper
and
journals
that
I
would
request
you
to
go
through
it
for
more
in
depth
getting
a
more
in
depth
idea
about
the
system.
Thank
you
so
much
see
you
on
the
next
video.
