Performance
factors
affecting
efficiency
and
design
recommendations
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Gaurav
Dhar
Bhaumik.
I
am
a
faculty
in
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology
Kharagpur .
So,
this
is
the
last
lecture
of
module
4,
where
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
primary
sedimentation
tank.
As
you
have
already
might
have
understood
the
process
flow
for
primary
treatment
units.
So,
earlier
we
discussed
about
the
different
type
of
screens,
we
discussed
and
designed
about
different
types
of
grid
chamber .
So,
and
the
skimming
time
now
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
primary
sedimentation
tank.
In
the
primary
these
are
the
concepts
that
will
be
covering
the
purpose
of
primary
sedimentation
tank,
the
flocculent
settling,
the
removal
efficiency
of
primary
sedimentation
tank,
design
parameter
for
primary
sedimentation
tank
and
the
design
recommendation.
To
start
with
after
we
remember
we
discussed
about
the
screen
and
then
we
discussed
about
the
grid
chamber ,
then
the
skimming
tank
and
sometimes
the
combination
of
both,
but
after
then
what
to
do?
As
we
already
know
that
we
after
going
through
the
screening
and
the
grid
chamber ,
we
already
get
rid
of
majority
of
the
suspended
inorganic
solids
right.
So,
we
consider
that
all
the
I
mean
like
the
all
the
this
inorganic
solids
it
is
already
removed
ok.
So,
now,
our
target
is
to
remove
the
organic
solids
ok.
So,
organic
solids
which
are
in
like
you
know
in
suspended
form
and
all.
So,
get
rid
of
them.
It
is
very
hard
to
get
rid
of
them
in
which
are
in
dissolved
form.
So,
we
will
discuss
about
it
how
to
get
rid
of
this
dissolved
organic
solid
also
in
the
secondary
treatment
unit,
but
majorly
in
primary
treatment
unit
our
target
is
to
remove
the
suspended
or
like
or
the
or
the
organic
solid
which
are
in
suspended
form
ok.
So,
this
is
our
major
target
to
remove
the
suspended
organic
solids
from
theour
treatment
line
by
using
the
primary
sedimentation
tank.
So,
in
general
we
normally
try
to
settle
the
lightweight
organic
matter
in
a
primary
sedimentation
tank
and
which
eventually
helps
us
removing
almost
30
to
40
percent
of
the
total
biochemical
oxygen
demand
and
also
for
50
to
70
percentage
of
suspended
solids
from
the
raw
sewage.
So,
you
might
have
confused
like
how
come
BOD
is
getting
removed.
You
understand
like
so,
when
we
remove
any
organic
matter
definitely
BOD
is
kind
of
a
indication
of
the
amount
of
organic
matter
present
in
your
wastewater
right
we
have
we
already
know
about
that.
So,
if
the
organic
matter
can
be
removed
definitely
the
BOD
will
also
be
removedtheoretically
and
in
a
way
if
the
BOD
removes
that
means,
your
treatment
efficiency
is
getting
enhanced.
That
means,
you
are
getting
you
are
treat
you
are
treating
your
wastewater
in
a
much
holistic
way
ok.
So,
this
primary
sedimentation
tank
is
used
for
removing
30
to
40
percent
of
the
total
biochemical
oxygen
demand
and
which
stands
for
almost
70
percentage
of
suspended
solid
which
can
be
removed
from
the
raw
sewage.
In
general
these
are
some
considerations
that
you
need
to
remember
the
flow
through
velocity
is
normally
kept
as
1
centimeter
per
second
at
average
flow
with
a
detention
period
of
around
90
to
150
minute.
Try
to
understand
here
organic
solids
are
removed
by
the
help
of
the
gravity
right.
So,
when
it
gets
sedimented
over
a
certain
period
of
time
if
we
keep
that
water
stable
or
you
know
keep
it
some
I
mean
like
in
a
large
container
or
the
tank
the
primary
sedimentation
tank
what
we
call.
So,
the
what
will
happen
all
the
solid
particles
are
suspended
solid
particles
organic
solid
will
start
settling
down
on
the
bottom.
So,
that
is
our
major
goal
here
ok.
So,
for
that
we
need
certain
little
bit
higher
amount
of
time
higher
amount
of
retention
time
or
detention
time
in
the
system
itself.
So,
it
can
be
as
high
as
100
and
150
minutes
to
be
kept
in
inside
the
primary
sedimentation
tank.
Horizontal
velocity
which
removes
the
organic
solid
suspended
solid
of
above
0.1
millimeter
and
the
wire
loading
less
than
185
meter
cube
per
meter
of
length
per
day
is
normally
used
for
designing
the
effluent
wire
length
ok.
So,
it
can
be
as
high
as
500
meter
cube
per
meter
per
day,
but
in
general
185
meter
cube
per
meter
either
length
or
width
wherever
we
are
placing
the
wire
based
on
the
length
we
this
is
the
standard
recommendations
given
by
the
like
you
know
scientist.
So,
when
we
do
when
we
design
a
primary
simulation
tank
we
need
to
start
with
certain
considerations
certain
recommendations
right.
So,
to
start
with
whether
we
should
go
for
circular
or
the
rectangular
type
it
depends
on
the
average
dry
weather
flow
and
also
we
can
check
with
the
peak
flow
conditions
also
we
can
check
with
the
availability
of
the
land
and
also
we
can
check
with
you
know
the
design
efficiency
that
you
are
expecting.
So,
based
on
all
these
parameters
you
can
either
choose
a
rectangular
or
circular
primary
sedimentation
tank.
The
diameter
if
it
is
a
circular
tank
it
may
be
in
the
range
of
6
3
to
60
meter
up
to
45
meter
is
typical
length
and
is
governed
with
the
structural
requirement
of
trusses
and
all
if
it
is
a
rectangular
tank
it
should
be
the
length
should
not
be
more
than
90
meter .
Even
it
is
90
meter
also
it
is
not
standard
we
in
the
standard
practice
we
do
not
if
the
length
is
more
than
40
meter
we
try
to
avoid
you
know
having
more
than
that
length
ok.
So,
in
case
if
we
our
requirement
is
more
than
40
meter
we
can
have
another
tank.
So,
we
can
bifurcate
our
flow
or
when
I
can
literally
divide
our
sewage
inflow
into
both
thesedimentation
tank
like
primary
sedimentation
tank
or
PST
is
in
short
when
we
call.
So,
remember
that
the
length
in
standard
we
can
go
up
to
90,
but
do
not
go
more
than
40
meter
that
is
like
it
is
unnecessary
occupying
the
place
I
mean
like
the
land
footprint
isn't
it.
So,
40
meter
is
our
standard
practice.
The
depth
of
the
mechanical
clean
tank
should
be
as
shallow
as
possible
with
the
minimum
of
2.15
meter
because
if
it
is
more
than
that
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
clean
the
bottom
the
sludge
that
is
getting
deposited
over
time.
And
also
the
average
depth
of
the
tank
normally
used
in
practice
is
3.5
meter
including
2.25
meter
of
sludge
zone
and
0.325
meter
of
freeboard
on
the
top
on
the
surface
even
above
the
top
of
the
surface
of
the
water
body
ok.
So,
all
total
around
3.5
meter
of
average
depth
of
the
tank
is
in
standard
practice.
The
floor
of
the
tank
is
to
be
provided
with
a
slope
of
6
to
16
degree
or
8
to
12
degree
typical
for
circular
tank
and
2
to
88
degree
for
rectangular
tanks.
So,
why
to
have
this
slope?
So,
that
the
waste
the
sludge
that
is
getting
that
is
getting
collected
can
be
collected
from
a
certain
area.
If
it
is
a
circular
tank
on
the
bottom
you
have
the
hooper
line.
So,
from
there
you
can
have
you
can
collect
the
sludge
or
if
it
is
like
rectangular
one
particular
one
angle
from
one
side
you
can
collect
the
all
the
sludges
ok.
So,
that
is
the
standard
practice.
The
scrappers
normally
attached
to
the
rotating
arm
in
case
of
circular
tank
and
because
it
is
much
easier
the
scrappers
will
actually
scrap
the
sludges
and
in
the
scrappers
it
has
a
certain
angle
it
makes
it
a
certain
angle.
So,
the
sludge
will
actually
go
to
a
certain
edge
or
it
will
come
towards
the
towards
inside
or
outside
based
on
our
design.
In
general
it
goes
the
design
in
made
such
a
way
that
it
will
come
towards
the
center .
So,
once
it
comes
towards
the
center
from
the
in
circular
shape
say
like
cylindrical
shape
the
tank
in
a
circular
tank.
So,
what
will
happen?
This
the
sludge
can
be
easily
collected
from
the
center
central
hopper
line.
In
case
of
rectangular
tank
we
have
a
endless
chain.
So,
endless
chain
it
is
like
you
know
it
is
like
a
like
a
rectangular
in
shape.
So,
it
goes
to
the
up
till
the
bottom
it
goes
like
continuously
it
goes
like
you
know
like
it
is
keep
on
moving
on
this
on
the
from
the
bottom
to
the
surface
of
this
rectangular
tank
and
it
by
this
way
it
will
actually
move
or
push
the
sludge
towards
a
certain
edge
certain
side.
So,
from
that
side
you
can
actually
collect
the
sludge
or
the
sedimented
organic
solid.
So,
when
we
design
the
primary
sedimentation
tank
the
sludge
hoppers
which
collect
the
sludge
either
at
the
influent
end
normally
at
the
influent
end
of
the
rectangular
tank
or
if
it
is
a
circular
it
is
in
the
in
the
center .
The
scrapper
velocity
should
be
around
0.6
to
1.2
meter
per
minute
0.9
meter
per
minute
is
typical
in
a
rectangular
tank
and
with
the
flatspeed
of
around
0.0
to
2.05
revolution
per
minute
0.3
is
typical
in
a
used
in
case
of
circular
tank.
Scum
removal
management
is
there
to
provide
ahead
of
the
effluent
wire.
So,
in
all
the
PSTs
so,
in
case
there
are
some
scum
that
slowly
float
that
on
the
surface
of
it.
So,
that
froth
can
be
that
scum
can
be
removed
ok.
Surface
overflow
rate
in
general
we
keep
around
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
and
for
design
for
the
average
flow
and
in
even
in
case
of
peak
flow
also
it
should
not
increase
the
value
120
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
Please
remember
this
value
120
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
because
this
is
a
very
standard
this
is
a
typical
value
that
we
can
have
for
SOR
or
surface
overflow
rates.
The
wire
loading
rate
less
than
185
meter
cube
per
meter
per
day
is
used
for
designing
the
effluent
wire
length
in
normally
in
the
range
of
125
to
500
meter
cube
per
meter
per
day
as
I
have
already
discussed
and
the
loading
rate
can
be
300
meter
cube
per
meter
days
acceptable
under
peak
flow
condition,
but
in
general
you
try
to
make
it
185
meter
cube
per
meter
per
day
not
more
than
that.
Wire
loading
rate
means
wire
loading
rate
means
what
after
the
wastewater
is
filled
after
the
treatment
is
done
then
what
happened
that
it
the
wastewater
goes
it
crosses
the
wire
and
then
it
goes
to
a
certain
collection
line
and
from
there
it
goes
to
the
effluent
effluent
line
further
for
the
further
treatment.
In
that
wire
where
normally
wire
is
normally
we
use
it
for
you
know
it
is
a
we
can
for
the
quantity
estimation
and
also
there
from
there
you
can
collect
that
water
and
you
can
collect
it
in
the
fall
out
treatment
line.
The
detention
time
as
I
was
mentioning
it
should
be
somewhere
around
60
minutes
to
150
minutes
or
1
hour
to
2.5
hour.
See
in
the
in
the
right
hand
side
the
picture
the
first
picture
actually
showcases
you
like
gives
you
an
idea
about
the
rectangular
tank
how
it
looks
like
see
the
in
the
in
the
influent
line
only
there
is
a
sludge
hooper
on
the
bottom
because
in
the
influent
line
when
the
water
enters
it
hits
the
baffle
one
in
the
baffle
and
then
maximum
of
the
solid
gets
deposited
there
itself.
But
with
time
if
there
are
time
there
is
enough
time
if
you
maintain
the
flow
in
such
way
that
it
will
stay
there
for
couple
of
at
least
a
hour
or
so.
What
will
happen
slowly
see
this
scraper
it
is
endless
it
is
keep
on
rotating
ok.
This
endless
scrappers
it
is
scrapping
all
the
suspended
I
mean
like
all
the
sedimented
organic
solid
on
the
bottom
and
push
it
towards
the
inlet
side
and
in
the
inlet
side
you
can
see
there
is
a
here
what
is
happening
to
this
inlets
here
the
all
the
sludge
is
getting
collected
from
there
the
sludge
can
be
easily
take
it
out
we
can
easily
take
out
the
sludge
and
from
here
this
is
the
wire
the
water
at
the
water
is
actually
of
the
baffle
it
actually
like
you
know
jumps
through
this
wire
and
comes
to
this
comes
to
this
effluent
wire
main
line
and
through
this
effluent
wires
actually
you
can
install
couple
of
them
based
on
the
design
requirement
and
you
can
then
connect
directly
connected
to
the
effluent
line
ok.
So,
this
is
how
the
circular
sedimentprimary
sedimentation
tank
look
looks
like
if
you
see
these
baffles
the
waste
water
influent
is
here
influence
is
provided
from
here
you
can
see
this
is
the
scrapper
this
is
this
like
it
is
like
two
wing
it
keeps
on
moving
rotating
towards
the
I
mean
like
I
mean
like
over
the
I
mean
like
the
how
to
say
like
the
surface
I
mean
like
the
bottom
of
this
circular
tanks
and
it
is
scrapping
the
all
the
sludges
and
it
makes
it
has
a
certain
angle
certain
angular
blade
which
blades
are
actually
moving
all
the
sludges
towards
the
inside.
So,
in
the
inside
there
is
a
in
the
in
the
center
where
there
is
a
circular
you
can
see
the
sludge
withdrawal
line
is
there
from
there
we
collect
the
sludge
also.
So,
from
here
we
have
the
inlet
line
it
will
float
from
like
it
flows
like
a
fountain
on
the
other
side
then
you
have
this
how
to
say
this
scrappers
through
this
scrappers
you
can
collect
the
sludge
from
either
of
this
side
from
the
center
side
center
only
and
then
the
effluent
wire
through
effluent
wire
the
fresh
I
mean
like
they
are
not
fresh
I
mean
like
the
waste
water
after
removing
after
it
is
the
solid
organic
solid
is
getting
removed
that
goes
through
the
safe
line
to
the
follow
up
treatment.
What
should
be
the
follow
up
treatment
here
in
general
it
should
be
the
secondary
treatment
units,
but
sometimes
if
there
is
a
fluctuation
in
flow
we
also
install
equalization
basin.
So,
in
general
after
primary
sedimentation
tank
the
standard
practice
is
to
go
for
secondary
treatment
unit,
but
sometimes
in
cases
case
to
case
basis
we
also
install
equalization
basin
to
regularize
the
flow.
So,
this
equation
by
CAM
can
be
used
for
to
calculate
the
critical
velocity
which
is
the
horizontal
velocity
that
will
that
will
just
produce
the
scar
on
the
bottom.
So,
that
is
the
maximum
velocity
that
we
can
actually
approach.
So,
this
is
like
8β𝑓𝑔𝑆−1()𝐷⎡⎣⎤⎦
So,
here
beta
is
the
constant
which
is
0.04
for
uni
granular
and
0.06
for
nongranular
sticky
material,
f
is
the
Darcy
Weisbach
friction
factor
0.02
to
0.03,
g
is
the
gravity
acceleration
due
to
gravity
and
the
s
is
the
specific
gravity
of
the
particle
to
be
removed.
In
general
we
target
like
targets
material
target
out
say
particle
in
primary
sedimentation
tank
is
having
a
specific
gravity
of
1.2
to
1.6
generally
1.25
and
the
diameter
of
the
particle
is
denoted
by
d.
In
general
suppose
if
you
all
the
other
equation
all
the
other
factors
the
constants
are
given
and
the
organic
solid
size
of
0.1
meter
millimeter
and
the
specific
gravity
of
1.25
meter
this
the
critical
velocity
will
become
0.063
meter
per
second.
So,
that
is
the
maximum
0.063
meter
per
second
is
the
critical
velocity
for
average
particle
size
of
0.1
millimeter
with
a
specific
gravity
of
1.25
in
primary
sedimentation
tank.
So,
now
let
us
do
a
couple
of
example
couple
of
numerical.So,
once
we
do
this
numerical
the
concept
will
be
much
more
clearer
and
you
can
actually
design
the
primary
sedimentation
tank
by
yourself
ok.
So,
please
go
through
this
material
again
and
again
I
will
first
share
the
I
will
do
the
discussion
first
and
I
would
request
you
to
have
your
calculator
and
pen
and
notebook
ready .
So,
that
you
can
do
it
along
with
me.
So,
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
understand
the
flow.
So,
the
it
is
asked
to
design
a
primary
sedimentation
tank
to
treat
wastewater
with
average
flow
rate
of
10
million
liter
per
day
and
the
peak
flow
of
22.5
million
liter
per
day.
If
you
remember
10
million
liter
per
day
is
the
average
flow
and
peak
flow
is
22.25
million
liter
per
day
that
means,
the
peak
factor
is
2.25.
But
anyway
so,
I
am
what
the
main
important
factor
here
is
that
the
peak
flow
is
the
we
discussed
right
that
what
at
which
conditions
there
is
a
chances
of
peak
flow
and
how
we
can
actually
how
our
design
can
actually
being
affected
because
of
the
peak
flow.
So,
we
will
see.
So,
in
general
we
have
to
assume
a
surface
settling
rate
of
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
as
it
is
mentioned
in
the
last
slide
also.
So,
you
have
to
first
take
the
surface
settling
rate
of
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
not
more
than
that
because
this
is
the
minimum
time
it
is
minimum
like
settling
rate
that
it
requires
for
your
solid
to
settle
on
the
bottom.
So,
if
you
consider
this
value
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
and
so,
you
can
easily
find
out
the
surface
area
you
know
the
average
flow
10
million
liter
per
day
if
it
is
like
10
million
liter
per
day.
So,
million
liter
means
10
to
the
power
6.
So,
10
into
10
to
the
power
6
liter
per
day
liter
2
you
can
easily
convert
into
meter
how
you
can
convert
into
meter
with
the
10
to
the
power
minus
3
because
1000
liter
is
1
meter
1
meter
cube.
So,
from
there
you
will
become
10
into
10
to
the
power
3
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
this
10
into
10
to
the
power
3
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
say
the
surface
area
is
given
is
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
So,
10
into
10
to
the
power
3
divided
by
40
it
will
become
250
ok
250
meter
square.
So,
this
250
meter
square
is
the
surface
area
of
tank
that
you
require.
So,
you
know
that
the
surface
area
should
be
250
meter
square.
Now ,
check
for
the
peak
flow
condition
in
case
of
peak
flow
condition
you
check
that
this
area
is
enough
or
not
in
case
of
peak
flow
condition
what
is
the
flow
22.5
million
liter
per
day
that
means,
22.5
into
10
to
the
power
3
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
250
it
will
become
90
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
You
remember
the
recommendation
value
recommended
value
for
the
recommended
value
is
120
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
it
should
not
be
more
than
that.
So,
as
the
in
case
of
peak
flow
also
the
value
is
90
which
is
less
than
120
that
means,
your
design
is
ok.
So,
that
means,
you
can
go
ahead
with
250
square
meter
of
area
that
much
of
areasurface
area
is
sufficient.
Now ,
assume
a
width
of
6
meter
you
do
not
take
more
than
6
meter
of
width
because
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
design
the
endless
chain
ok.
So,
in
general
one
when
we
are
talking
about
the
design
is
here
majorly
the
rectangular
primary
simulation
tank
as
you
can
understand.
So,
if
you
have
a
length
of
6
meter .
So,
what
will
be
the
theoretical
width
of
6
meter
what
will
be
the
theoretical
length
250
square
meter
is
the
surface
area
divided
by
length
6
you
will
become
it
will
become
41.66
which
is
more
than
40
meter .
So,
when
it
is
more
than
40
meter
what
I
have
told
you
that
let
us
have
two
sedimentation
tank.
Do
not
I
mean
like
do
not
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
like
you
know
in
that
case
it
will
reduce
the
footprint
and
also
I
mean
like
it
will
actually
help
us
to
control
the
process
parameter
in
a
very
easy
way.
So,
total
length
of
the
each
tank
now
first
we
discussed
it
is
like
41.6
is
divided
by
2
plus
2
meter
plus
2
meter
inlet
and
outlet
you
have
to
give
some
additional
excess
place
in
2
meter
plus
2
meter
here
and
there.
So,
it
is
coming
around
40
24.83
say
like
24.85
meter .
So,
each
PSTs
primary
sedimentation
tank
for
your
design
has
having
a
length
of
24.83
meter
and
the
width
is
6
meter .
Now ,
we
know
that
the
flow
rate
into
retention
time
flow
rate
into
retention
time
it
represents
the
volume
because
suppose
the
flow
rate
is
1
meter
cube
per
hour
and
your
retention
time
in
your
chamber
is
say
2
hour.
That
means,
what
is
the
volume
of
your
reactor
how
much
time
it
will
take
for
the
water
to
fill
up
1
meter
cube
per
hour
and
area
total
time
is
2
hour.
So,
2
meter
cube
so
that
means,
the
volume
is
2
meter
cube.
So,
that
is
how
we
calculate.
So,
flow
rate
into
detention
time
is
equal
to
volume
plus
depth
into
surface
area
that
is
also
volume
ok.
So,
out
of
these
4
parameters
which
are
the
2
you
known
to
us
flow
rate
we
know ,
detention
time
as
of
now
we
do
not
know ,
depth
we
do
not
know ,
surface
area
we
know
surface
area
how
much
we
took
we
take
250
square
meter
and
the
flow
rate
is
also
known
to
us.
So,
flow
rate
by
surface
area
you
will
get
the
depth
into
detention
time
isn't
it.
So,
you
just
interchange
it
flow
rate
into
detention
time
equal
to
depth
into
surface
area
surface
area
goes
in
the
left
side
it
will
become
depth
by
detention
time
and
which
is
also
the
surface
settling
rate
and
surface
rate
is
how
much
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
So,
from
there
if
you
provide
say
take
a
detention
time
of
around
1.5
hour
you
can
easily
calculate
the
depth
how
1.5
multiplied
by
40
isn't
it.
So,
which
is
like
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
surface
settling
rate.
So,
1.5
into
40
so,
1.5
hour
to
convert
it
into
day
1.5
divided
by
24
into
40
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day.
So,
it
will
become
2.5
meter .
Now ,
we
know
the
depth
so,
depth
is
we
find
out
the
depth
now.
So,
now,
once
the
depth
is
known
to
us
we
can
easily
findout
the
flow
through
velocity
what
is
the
flow
through
velocity
flow
through
velocity
is
like
in
the
depth
I
mean
like
it
is
like
a
you
cut
that
rectangular
PST
say
like
half.
So,
what
will
be
this
area.
So,
it
is
a
majorly
the
depth
into
width
ok.
So,
depth
into
width
and
there
are
two
two
number
of
tanks
are
there.
So,
if
you
have
a
initial
flow
rate
initial
flow
rate
is
how
much
40
MLD
sorry
10
MLD
10
MLD
you
do
the
calculation
by
yourself
10
MLD
if
you
convert
it
into
10
MLD
into
say
10
into
10
to
the
power
3
meter
cube
per
day
isn't
it.
MLD
to
meter
cube
per
day
just
multiplied
with
10
to
the
power
10
to
the
power
3.
So,
10
MLD
is
now
become
10
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
10
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
10
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
how
much.
So,
if
you
say
10
into
sorry
10
MLD
into
10
to
the
power
3
that
is
what
I
was
I
meant.
So,
10
MLD
means
10
into
10
to
the
power
3
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
10
into
10
3
meter
cube
per
day
if
you
convert
it
into
second
what
will
become.
So,
you
have
to
divide
it
with
86,400
isn't
it
because
86,400
seconds
are
there
in
a
day.
So,
10
into
10
3
divided
by
86,400
if
you
do
that
calculation
it
will
become
0.116
meter
cube
per
second.
Please
do
it
with
your
calculator
to
confirm
it.
So,
0.116
meter
cube
per
second
is
now
we
know
that
this
is
the
average
flow.
So,
this
average
flow
is
the
flow
at
which
water
is
going
and
this
is
the
say
like
surface
area
there
the
area
cut
sectional
area
cut
sectional
area
and
the
surface
flow
if
the
surface
flow
divided
by
cut
sectional
area
you
will
get
the
velocity
isn't
it.
So,
the
flow
rate
divided
by
area
you
will
get
the
velocity .
So,
the
flow
rate
is
0.116
meter
cube
per
second
or
cubic
meter
per
second
divided
by
surface
area
surface
area
is
how
much
2.5
meter
is
the
depth
6
meter
is
the
y
width
and
2
number
of
tanks
are
there
2
into
2.5
into
6.
So,
a
flow
through
velocity
becomes
0.0039
meter
per
second
if
you
do
the
calculation
it
will
become
0.0039
meter
cube
meter
per
second.
So,
which
is
less
than
1
centimeter
per
second
so
that
means,
our
design
is
ok.
Our
target
is
the
flow
through
velocity
should
not
be
more
than
1
centimeter
per
second.
If
it
is
more
than
1
centimeter
per
second
there
is
a
chance
that
the
suspended
solid
I
mean
a
suspended
organic
that
organic
solid
will
not
sediment
properly .
So,
our
target
is
to
reduce
have
the
flow
through
velocity
less
than
1
centimeter
per
second.
In
given
in
case
of
peak
flow
let
us
do
the
design
for
the
peak
flow
even
for
the
peak
flow
which
is
22.5
milliliter
per
day.
So,
22.5
into
10
to
the
power
3
that
much
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
same
2
into
625
now
it
becomes
750
meter
per
day
divided
by
86,400.
So,
it
will
become
in
second.
Since
second
if
you
see
it
is
coming
0.0087
meter
per
second
meter
per
second
that
means,
that
still
it
is
much
less
than
the
1
meter
per
1
centimeter
persecond
of
I
would
say
like
the
roof
the
deadline
that
we
added
value
that
we
have
ok.
So,
in
it
is
always
better
to
have
the
horizontal
velocity
should
be
checked
for
non-scoring
velocity
which
is
less
than
0.06
meter
per
second
and
that
is
what
the
standard
practice.
So,
that
means,
1
centimeter
per
second
is
obviously ,
our
target,
but
even
in
case
of
any
emer gency
it
should
not
be
more
than
6
centimeter
per
second
ok.
So,
we
can
provide
at
so,
what
will
the
total
depth
of
the
reactor
I
mean
if
the
tank
2.5
meter
we
already
found
out,
but
now
we
have
to
place
around
0.5
meter
say
like
for
free
board
on
the
top
and
on
the
bottom
we
have
to
provide
0.25
meter
of
depth
for
sludge
accumulation
you
know .
So,
all
total
will
become
so,
it
becomes
total
3.25
meter
the
total
height.
Now ,
wire
loading
rate
even
in
general
if
I
if
you
only
install
the
wire
on
the
one
side
of
the
how
to
say
the
width
wise.
So,
suppose
in
this
design
where
if
you
remember
in
this
design
where
is
the
wire
here
on
the
width
wise
ok.
If
you
width
wise
you
provide
only
wire
I
mean
like
one
wire
what
will
happen.
So,
width
means
how
much
is
the
width
in
this
calculation
6
meter .
So,
you
have
2
tanks
so,
6
plus
6
12
meter .
So,
you
are
considering
that
your
flow
rate
flow
is
only
your
effluent
is
only
going
through
from
here
it
will
go
through
this
effluent
wire
and
you
are
collecting
it.
So,
but
you
have
a
limitation
of
185
meter
cube
per
meter
per
day
that
calculation
also
is
there
isn't
it.
So,
that
also
we
need
to
be
considered
about.
So,
now,
let
us
first
find
out
what
will
happen
if
we
only
install
in
width
wise.
So,
10
into
10
to
the
power
3
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
12
meter
12
meter
is
the
width
that
we
have.
So,
now,
the
wire
loading
becomes
833.
So,
that
is
not
a
good
design.
So,
we
are
not
we
will
not
it
is
not
enough
the
wire
that
we
have
provide
on
the
effluent
wire
that
we
have
provide
on
the
one
side
of
the
width
of
the
tank
is
not
enough.
So,
we
need
to
provide
couple
of
more
how
what
is
the
actual
length
of
wire
that
we
require
if
we
provide
this
185
meter
cube
per
meter
per
day
of
wire
loading
rate.
So,
we
can
easily
find
out
by
total
average
flow
divided
by
185
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
per
meter
per
day
sorry .
So,
from
there
you
can
easily
find
out
the
length
of
wire
that
is
required
as
54.05
meter .
So,
what
you
can
do
you
can
have
you
already
know
you
can
have
the
27.1
meter
of
wire
length
for
each
tank
and
this
can
be
divided
into
you
know
2.
So,
because
we
have
2
tank
already .
So,
one
tank
we
can
have
27.1
another
tank
also
have
we
have
27.1
say.
So,
in
27.1
how
we
can
divide
it
into
your
tank
you
place
it
on
the
2
effluent
channel
across
the
width
at
the
at
the
outlet
end.
So,
outlet
end
if
you
are
providing
2
outlet
wire.
So,
each
one
willbe
having
how
much
what
is
the
length
here
what
is
the
total
width
here
6.
So,
6
into
6
there
12
12
into
12
if
you
like
all
total
you
will
get
24
plus
you
have
a
side
wire
of
1.55
meter
on
each
side
ok.
So,
in
general
it
is
always
better
to
have
like
you
know .
So,
in
that
case
you
this
way
you
can
actually
successfully
actually
install
amount
of
wire
that
you
require
that
you
it
is
required
and
in
your
design
is
complete.
So,
the
same
way
we
can
do
this
same
problem
also.
So,
this
is
almost
the
same
procedure
you
can
see
here
also
the
1.12
million
liter
per
day
is
the
average
flow
and
peak
factor
is
peak
factor
is
2.
If
the
peak
factor
is
2
that
means,
what
is
the
peak
flow
24
MLT
isn't
it.
So,
from
there
you
can
see
here
also
you
can
do
the
this
problem
by
yourself.
So,
that
you
will
get
an
idea
because
it
is
the
same
as
earlier ,
but
once
you
do
it
by
yourself
and
you
check
with
the
solution
it
will
be
giving
you
a
much
easier
interpretation
ok.
So,
I
am
not
going
into
details
again
I
am
not
going
to
discuss
it
all.
So,
I
am
leaving
it
to
you
so,
that
you
go
through
it
and
actually
do
the
calculation
by
yourself.
So,
to
it
will
be
it
will
give
you
a
one
kind
of
a
exercise
for
actual
design.
So,
in
conclusion
we
got
to
know
about
the
necessity
of
primary
sedimentation
tank
and
its
crucial
role
that
it
plays
in
wastewater
treatment
by
removing
the
organic
matter
and
suspended
organic
matter
from
the
solid.
And
this
now
this
is
normally
placed
after
the
grit
removal
tank
grit
I
mean
like
the
grit
chamber
and
normally
it
has
a
we
know
certain
calculations
and
certain
understanding
assumptions
also
we
understood
and
what
is
the
basis
of
it
also
we
understand
and
we
now
will
continue
with
further
treatment
unit
design.
So,
these
are
the
references
and
here
only
I
will
stop
with
the
fourth
module.
So,
and
we
will
continue
with
the
fifth
module
in
a
coming
lecture.
Thank
you
so
much.
