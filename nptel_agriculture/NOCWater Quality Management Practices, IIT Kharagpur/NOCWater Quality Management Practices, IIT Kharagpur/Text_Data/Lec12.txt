Order
of
Reaction
and
Types
of
Reactors
Used
in
Wastewater
Treatment
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharwami
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology
Kharagpur.
So,
with
continuation
of
the
lecture
11,
we
will
be
discussing
in
the
module
3
about
the
fundamentals
of
reactor
engineering
and
self
purification
of
natural
waters.
In
this
particular
lecture,
I
will
be
discussing
about
the
order
of
reaction
and
the
types
of
reactors
used
in
wastewater
treatment.
The
concept
that
will
be
covered
are
the
order
of
reactions,
the
types
of
reactor,
the
reaction
rate
constant,
the
types
of
reactions,
the
homogeneous
and
the
heterogeneous
reactions
and
the
catalyst
in
the
reactions.
To
start
with
order
of
reaction
are
it
is
a
very
important,
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
understand
the
you
know
the
I
would
say
the
quality
of
the
reactions
and
the
what
are
the
nature
of
the
reactions
and
how
it
will
involve
the
substrates
or
the
final
byproducts
of
the
products.
So,
in
general
order
of
reaction
by
definition
it
is
the
relationship
between
the
rate
of
change
of
concentration
of
the
reacting
substance
and
the
concentration
of
that
substance
over
time
in
that
particular
reactor
or
particular
setup
ok.
So,
say
mathematically
if
I
say
ds
by
dt
is
equal
to
k
into
s
to
the
power
n.
𝑑𝑆𝑑𝑡=𝐾×𝑆𝑛
What
is
this
?
This
suppose
is
the
rate
of
change
of
concentration
of
a
substrate
s𝑑𝑆𝑑𝑡𝑑𝑆𝑑𝑡
and
what
is
s
is
the
concentration
of
the
reacting
substance
ok.
And
k
is
the
reaction
rate
constant
and
this
n
is
a
very
it
is
very
important,
this
n
denotes
the
order
of
the
reaction
ok.
So,
whereas,
the
t
is
the
time
taken
during
the
reactions
and
also
this
k
is
equal
to𝑑𝑆𝑑𝑡 
.
This
a
number
value
in
s
n
value
of
n
is
actually
the
one
that
will
determine
the𝐾×𝑆𝑛
order
of
the
reaction
ok.
What
are
the
importance
of
it?
This
determines
the
rate
of
reactions
in
order
to
successfully
operate
the
treatment
plant.
It
provides
an
indication
of
how
changing
the
concentration
of
the
reactant
will
affect
the
reaction
speed
and
the
other
product
by
product
recovery
of
the
product
recovery
of
the
system.
Suppose
n
is
1
this
will
become
k
into
s
isn't
it.𝑑𝑆𝑑𝑡And
suppose
it
would
be
considered
as
a
first
order
reaction
then
suppose
that
the
n
value
of
n
is
2
that
means,
ds
by
dt
will
become
k
into
s
to
the
power
2
ok.
It
is
a
second
order
reaction
and
so
on
so
forth.
So,
at
which
case
it
will
be
called
0th
order
reaction?
What
will
be
the
value
of
n
in
case
of
0th
order
reaction?
Definitely
0
if
the
value
of
n
is
0
S
0
means
1
if
any
unit
to
the
power
0
is
1
anything
about
to
the
power
0.
So,
S
0
is
1.
So,
ds
by
dt
will
become
constant
that
is
why
it
is
called
the
0th
order
reaction.
But
in
case
of
0th
order
reaction
what
will
happen
what
does
that
mean?
That
means,
the
change
of
substrate
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
inlet
I
mean
like
the
nothing
to
do
with
the
concentration
of
the
reacting
substance
it
is
anyway
constant
ok.
So,
and
what
are
the
different
factors
at
which
this
rate
constant
are
affected
on?
First
of
all
the
temperature,
temperature
of
the
reaction,
temperature
of
the
nearby
area
when
the
reaction
is
taking
place,
the
nutrient
present
in
the
waste
water
or
the
water
or
the
reaction
when
it
where
it
is
taking
place
the
toxicity.
The
presence
of
the
toxicity
will
definitely
change
the
characteristics
of
the
microorganism
the
presence
of
microorganisms
at
a
whole.
So,
which
will
also
drastically
change
the
reaction
rate.
And
then
there
comes
the
catalyst
sometimes
we
add
catalyst.
What
is
the
basic
definition
of
catalyst?
It
somehow
it
will
not
act
on
it
will
not
directly
involve
by
itself
in
the
as
a
substrate
or
as
a
product
it
will
be
only
useful
this
catalyst
to
somehow
accelerate
or
decelerate
the
reaction
that
is
why
it
is
called
catalyst
ok.
That
is
why
we
call
it
catalytic
reactions
in
the
sometimes
it
can
be
accelerating
the
reaction
it
can
be
decelerating
the
reaction
ok.
So,
based
on
this
catalyst
presence
of
catalyst
also
the
rate
constant
will
change
isn't
it?
Then
comes
the
zeroth
order
as
I
was
discussing
the
N=0.
Rate
is
constant
it
is
independent
of
the
substrate
concentration
what
is
the
example?
Certain
catalytic
reactions
in
certain
catalytic
reactions
you
add
some
catalyst
it
is
you
are
you
know
that
your
the
substrate
I
mean
like
the
substrate
concentration
it
does
not
have
any
effect
on
the
change
in
substrate
I
mean
change
in
substrate
over
time
ok.
So,
the
rate
of
change
in
substrate
over
time.
First
order
the
rate
is
proportion
directly
proportional
to
the
concentration
of
the
reacting
substance
most
of
the
most
of
the
cases
are
decomposition
of
single
substance
as
I
was
discussing
in
the
earlier
lecture
also
if
you
remember
that
suppose
you
have
a
sugar
solution
it
has
only
the
sugar
ok.
Suppose
the
only
one
particular
chemical.
So,
the
rate
of
change
of
this
reaction
will
be
obviously,
directly
proportional
to
the
concentration
of
the
reacting
substrate.
The
more
the
reacting
substance
the
more
the
sugar
that
you
add
it
will
take
more
amount
of
time
which
is
quite
directly
proportional
unless
until
some
additional
factors
are
also
taking
into
like
you
know
started
playing
amajor
role
here
ok.
We
will
discuss
about
that
also
in
this
particular
example
please
remember.
Next
is
second
order
in
some
cases
the
rate
of
change
of
this
reactions
is
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
concentration
of
the
reacting
substance.
For
example,
some
attached
growth
biological
processes
like
super
rate
trickling
filter
and
all
we
will
be
discussing
about
it
what
is
super
rate
trickling
filter.
This
trickling
filter
we
are
hearing
a
lot.
So,
you
will
be
understanding
it
in
a
very
finer
way
in
a
coming
modules
that
how
this
trickling
filter
comes
into
the
picture
what
is
this
and
how
it
actually
works
this
is
a
very
fascinating
treatment
unit
ok.
Anyway
before
that
we
have
to
understand
what
is
attached
growth
also.
There
are
attached
growth
process
and
suspended
growth
process
we
will
be
discussing
more
in
coming
lecture,
but
to
give
you
a
glimpse
suspended
growth
means
suppose
you
have
a
column
of
water
if
a
cylinder
of
waste
water
in
the
waste
water
there
you
are
aerating
and
some
amount
of
some
kind
of
microorganisms
will
start
grow
into
it.
Those
microorganisms
will
consume
the
substrate.
So,
once
it
will
consume
the
substrate
it
will
grow
it
will
if
it
will
not
attach
to
the
boundary
wall
or
it
will
not
attach
to
the
peripheral
wall
or
it
will
not
attach
to
the
on
the
bottom
it
will
be
floating
freely
floating
on
like
floating
on
you
know
like
in
a
moving
or
around
the
column
of
this
water
column
what
it
will
happen
it
will
be
called
as
a
suspended
it
is
not
it
is
not
in
attached
growth
one
it
is
a
kind
of
like
you
know
freely
moving
one
ok.
So,
then
there
is
come
there
is
come
there
come
some
kind
of
microorganisms
which
needs
some
place
to
attach
then
only
they
will
grow
further
we
call
it
attached
growth.
So,
there
is
one
type
of
suspended
growth
another
one
is
attached
growth
ok.
You
understand
this
attached
growth
this
trickling
filter
is
a
type
of
attached
growth
process
that
means,
you
need
to
provide
some
media
some
material
on
which
over
the
surface
or
inside
of
some
area
is
available
for
microorganism
to
grow.
So,
when
the
microorganisms
will
grow
it
will
also
reduce
the
substrate
concentration
it
will
reduce
the
pollutant
concentration.
So,
that
is
how
it
works
ok.
In
biological
reactions
definitely
the
order
of
reaction
are
in
it
is
very
crucial
because
you
know
it
will
give
us
an
idea
about
that
how
pollutants
will
be
removed
and
the
impact
of
different
environmental
conditions
on
the
treatment
process.
It
also
helps
us
to
optimize
the
treatment
systems
for
more
efficacy
like
biological
stabilization
of
organic
matter
or
etcetera.
So,
when
we
talk
about
the
biological
stabilization
of
organic
matter
it
is
it
is
a
very
fascinating.
So,
in
general
when
we
were
discussing
about
the
simple
sugar
solution
I
told
you
it
is
a
first
order
equation
in
general
right.
It
feels
like
you
know
if
you
have
theonly
you
keep
on
adding
the
sugar
it
will
take
more
amount
of
time
for
your
organic
for
your
biological
treatment
system
to
consume
it
I
mean
like
the
microorganisms
to
consume
it.
However,
though
it
looks
like
a
first
order
reactions
it
is
actually
pseudo
first
order
reactions
also
we
can
mention.
Because
what
happens
sometimes
it
may
have
some
say
like
some
amount
of
additional
foreign
matter
particles.
Normally
on
the
most
of
the
reaction
in
the
organic
matter
when
we
add
in
the
wastewater
treatment
unit
it
has
a
different
kind
of
organic
matter
which
does
not
follow
the
individually
they
follow
the
say
like
first
order
reactions,
but
when
it
comes
they
comes
along
with
each
other
along
with
some
environmental
parameters
also
come
into
the
picture.
So,
those
environmental
parameters
also
control
the
reaction.
So,
at
that
time
it
becomes
the
pseudo
first
order
reaction.
That
means,
the
rate
of
reaction
is
proportional
to
the
organic
matter
concentration
at
favorable
parameter
and
which
is
controlling
the
reactions
provided
those
parameters
are
favorable
to
them
then
only
it
will
be
considered
as
first
order
otherwise
it
is
a
pseudo
first
order
and
that
is
why
it
is
it
has
certain
you
know
like
the
controlling
parameters.
So,
because
of
that
it
is
called
the
pseudo
first
order
reactions.
What
is
pseudo
zero
order
reactions?
The
organic
matter
concentration
is
maintained
constant
within
a
narrow
range
and
the
rate
of
reaction
is
practically
constant.
That
means,
suppose
your
treatment
unit
is
receiving
same
amount
of
waste
for
same
amount
of
waste
for
a
very
small
amount
small
range
of
time
and
all
ok.
But
I
mean
a
small
amount
of
for
a
longer
period
of
time
in
a
very
the
I
mean
like
the
change
of
concentration
is
very
narrow
ok.
So,
it
is
almost
receiving
the
same
amount
of
waste
over
time.
Once
it
will
receive
the
same
amount
of
waste
over
time
all
the
reaction
parameters
will
actually
looks
like
it
is
constant
because
it
is
not
changing
the
the
the
the
it
is.
So,
it
becomes
the
zeroth
order
reaction.
So,
it
is
called
it
looks
like
a
zeroth
order
reaction,
but
it
is
actually
a
first
order
reaction.
So,
it
makes
it
little
bit
ambiguous
to
each
other.
So,
that
is
why
we
call
it
pseudo
zero
order
reaction
ok.
In
general
the
complex
substrate
present
in
the
waste
water
or
the
sewage
it
may
appear
as
first
order
reactions
with
individual
substrate
exhibiting
the
zero
order
reaction
kinetics
and
all
ok.
What
is
the
reason?
Initially
this
reaction
will
be
much
higher
because
of
the
higher
utilization
of
the
easily
biodegradable
waste
and
then
rate
becomes
slower
with
respect
to
time
due
to
more
complex
substrate
left
in
the
reactor.
The
most
more
complex
substrate
will
be
there
it
will
take
more
time
for
the
microorganism
to
consume
it
with
time.
The
reactions
in
the
reactor.
So,
one
of
the
major
important
thing
is
here
the
temperatureeither
some
reactions
are
heat
liberating
or
the
exothermic
we
call
it
some
are
heat
absorbing
or
the
endothermic
in
nature.
So,
operating
temperature
is
thus
the
very
important
factor
for
designing
a
reactor.
The
reaction
in
a
reactor
can
be
called
homogeneous
when
it
occurs
only
in
single
phase
and
when
it
heterogeneous
that
means,
when
it
occurs
in
at
least
in
the
presence
of
two
phases
you
can
see
the
picture
you
can
understand
like
you
know
in
the
homogeneous
phase
and
you
have
a
heterogeneous
phase
ok.
So,
then
we
have
the
catalytic
reactions
the
reactions
occurring
in
a
reactor
may
be
classified
as
catalytic
or
non
catalytic
based
on
what?
Based
on
the
presence
of
catalyst.
If
the
catalyst
are
used
is
neither
reactant
nor
product,
but
it
can
either
accelerate
or
hinder
a
rate
of
reaction
as
I
was
discussing.
So,
this
is
called
a
catalytic
reactions.
In
general
wastewater
treatment
or
treatment
processes
is
generally
achieved
in
the
reactors
through
physical
chemical
and
the
biological
process
facilitating
the
treatment
provided
we
sometimes
add
some
catalytic
reaction
also
in
it
and
it
can
be
homogeneous
or
heterogeneous
in
nature.
What
are
the
types
of
reactor
based
on
the
you
know
the
like
the
treatment
process
that
will
be
following
in
order
to
achieve
more
better
treated
water
with
no
minor
or
say
almost
no
modification
in
the
installed
infrastructure
we
need
to
design
a
reactor
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
add
the
flexibility
of
retrofitting,
it
will
add
it
will
actually
do
the
job
that
we
are
targeting
in
a
minimum
operational
land
requirement
or
the
footprint
we
call
it.
The
reactors
of
the
wastewater
treatment
systems
also
have
should
have
a
different
performance
characteristics
and
also
different
direct
impacts
on
the
environment
as
I
was
discussing
and
the
system
modification
is
achievable
only
by
the
simple
alteration
of
the
process
for
a
quality
parameters.
This
is
also
very
important
for
us
to
understand
whenever
we
will
be
designing
a
reactor.
So,
you
can
see
that
in
general
how
it
looks
like
it
is
a
very
symbolic
very
nice
picture
if
you
see
in
the
bottom
the
wastewater
comes
this
rack
or
the
screens
then
it
goes
to
the
grid
chamber
the
grids
were
settled
down
in
the
bottom
then
it
goes
to
the
clarifier
for
primary
sedimentation
then
it
goes
to
the
activated
sludge
tank
is
nothing,
but
the
biological
treatment
unit
from
activated
sludge
tank
the
secondary
treatment
start
the
biological
or
biochemical
treatment
start.
Then
it
goes
to
the
immobilized
lacquers
chambers
and
then
it
goes
to
the
flocculation
on
the
filtration
tank
and
then
it
goes
to
the
after
the
filtration
everything
is
done
then
it
goes
to
the
water
which
is
coming
out
of
the
treatment
plant
is
almost
clean
water
or
you
see
we
call
it
clarified
water
that
clarified
water
it
is
almost
clean
almost
adhering
to
the
guidelines
given
by
the
regulatory
bodies
in
general.
So,
let
us
discuss
about
the
types
of
reactor
ok,
why
it
is
very
important
for
you
to
understand
when
you
will
design
a
wastewater
treatment
unit
or
the
plant
ok.
Based
onthe
type
what
are
the
different
types
of
reactors?
Batch
reactor,
plug
flow
reactor,
continuous
flow
state,
tank
reactor,
arbitrary
flow
reactor,
packed
bed
reactor
and
the
fluidized
bed
reactor
ok.
What
is
batch
reactor?
It
is
very
easy
for
you
to
understand
suppose
you
have
a
container
you
have
a
container
you
fill
it
with
the
wastewater
and
leave
it
for
say
like
one
day.
After
one
day
say
when
it
will
you
are
sure
that
there
are
the
substance
I
mean
like
the
organic
organic
matter
concentration
goes
down
a
bit
then
you
take
out
the
take
out
the
supernatant
and
the
sludge
you
put
it
in
the
different
bucket
then
you
clean
it
and
then
use
the
same
tank
same
I
mean
like
the
container
for
new
wastewater
and
use
it
for
another
one
day.
So,
this
is
like
the
fill
reaction
settle
decant
and
idle.
So,
this
is
called
the
batch
reactor
means
like
you
are
using
the
same
reactor
and
using
you
are
waiting
for
the
reaction
to
take
place
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
you
do
this
all
the
5
operation
at
the
same
time
then
you
start
a
new
one
in
the
same
reactor
it
is
called
the
batch
process
ok.
They
are
normally
operated
as
a
fill
and
draw
process
fill
and
draw
type
fill
and
draw
type
you
fill
it
and
make
the
wait
it
for
some
reaction
to
take
place
then
settle
it
when
the
settle
solid
is
there
and
then
you
have
you
have
you
have
the
decant
it
and
then
you
let
it
idle
for
some
time
or
wash
it
and
use
the
new
batch
again
ok.
So,
this
is
called
the
batch
reactor
ok.
You
can
easily
understand
BOD
bottles
we
discussed
about
the
how
BOD
we
analyze
the
BOD
reactors
and
all
this
BOD
bottles
are
incubated
in
a
incubator
chamber
for
analysis
of
BOD
is
a
type
of
batch
reactor
ok.
Another
important
is
a
sequencing
batch
reactor
or
SBR
remember
this
name
SBR
we
will
be
discussing
about
it
a
lot
and
in
future
and
it
is
a
very
advanced
treatment
unit
that
nowadays
all
over
world
people
are
working
on
SBR
sequencing
batch
reactor
SBR.
It
drastically
reduces
the
footprint
required
for
a
treatment
plant
instead
of
having
a
lot
of
treatment
unit
it
can
it
can
has
it
has
the
capacity
to
reduce
the
footprint
like
anything
ok.
Then
there
comes
the
continuous
flow
steer
tank
continuously
mixed
reactor
we
call
it.
Suppose
you
have
a
system
where
you
are
keep
on
mixing
the
water
you
know
by
some
by
using
some
mixer
by
using
some
say
agitator
or
some
aeration
some
by
some
means
you
are
keep
on
mixing
the
water
continuously .
So,
the
what
will
happen
when
you
add
the
influent
you
cannot
distinguish
you
can
take
sample
from
any
random
point
and
the
water
constituents
the
homo
like
you
know
same
characteristics
the
I
mean
like
the
whole
reactor
will
have
a
same
homogeneous
content.
This
is
called
the
continuous
flow
steer
tank
reactor
and
all
ok.
Then
you
when
you
keep
on
adding
with
proper
calculation
has
to
be
done
you
add
with
a
certain
influent
characteristics
and
the
effluent
has
to
be
collected
which
will
be
having
which
will
be
having
less
than
the
parameter
that
is
having
that
is
there
in
the
influentone
another
ok.
So,
this
is
this
is
quite
interesting
this
continuous
flow
reactor
and
all.
Then
there
comes
the
plug
flow
or
the
tubular
flow
reactor
it
is
very
easy
to
understand.
It
is
more
like
you
know
you
have
a
it
is
more
like
a
you
have
a
system
where
you
put
the
water
from
one
side
and
from
the
other
side
it
will
go
out.
So,
the
time
taken
inside
this
inside
this
say
reactor
is
exactly
the
time
for
which
the
water
will
stay
in
the
system
you
understand.
So,
it
is
like
you
know
the
first
water
molecule
when
it
enters
to
the
systems
it
stay
there
for
like
say
like
2
days
and
exactly
after
2
days
that
water
molecule
will
exit
the
system.
So,
whenever
new
water
molecule
come
in
the
in
the
in
the
second
one
second
one
will
come
exactly
in
the
second
position
second
to
the
first
one
when
it
will
leave.
So,
it
will
all
the
water
molecules
I
mean
like
theoretically
it
should
have
exact
amount
of
time
to
stay
inside
the
reactor
ok.
So,
it
is
like
you
know
the
I
mean
like
the
it
has
this
proper
system
proper
you
know
you
know
it
is
like
you
know
we
call
it
this
is
called
this
is
why
we
call
it
plug
flow
or
tubular
flow
reactors
you
understand.
This
is
the
all
the
particles
remain
in
the
tank
has
a
for
a
time
is
equal
to
the
theoretical
detention
time.
Then
there
comes
the
arbitrary
flow
or
flow
what
is
arbitrary
flow?
It
is
more
like
you
know
it
has
a
it
is
a
mixture
of
say
the
continuous
mixed
continuous
type
and
continuously
mixed
time
and
also
the
plug
flow
time.
So,
it
has
a
intermixing
or
dispersed
flow,
but
it
is
somewhere
lies
between
the
ideal
plug
flow
reactor
and
the
ideal
completely
mixed
reactor
ok.
So,
it
also
we
use
arbitrary
flow
quite
a
quite
a
good
amount
of
time
in
actual
real
field
where
the
treatment
plants
are
actually
designed
before
the
equillation
tank
was
installed.
If
equillation
tank
is
not
installed
because
they
have
a
arbitrary
flow
in
the
system.
Then
there
comes
the
packed
bed
reactor
packed
bed
reactor
is
nothing
you
have
a
media
and
waste
water
is
in
like
you
know
come
kind
how
to
say
introduced
to
the
system
from
the
bottom
and
then
say
like
we
have
a
media
or
it
can
be
done
from
the
upper
side
also
ok.
It
is
not
necessary
that
it
should
be
bottom
in
this
picture
it
is
shown
the
off
flow
one
there
can
be
down
flow
one
also
ok.
So,
I
mean
like
in
general
the
off
flow
one
if
you
see
the
picture
how
it
looks
like
the
waste
water
has
to
flow
through
a
media
then
the
effluent
will
come
out
from
the
top
and
it
will
be
discharged.
How
it
is
important
because
this
media
this
is
packed
bed
that
means,
this
packed
bed
in
this
bed
bed
means
this
is
a
region
where
the
microorganisms
can
develop
easily
ok.
So,
when
the
aeration
is
also
supply
in
this
particular
case
if
you
see
the
aerobic
bacteria
will
grow.
So,
air
along
with
the
waste
water
enters
to
the
media
enters
to
the
media
bed
and
it
will
cross
the
media
bed
and
it
will
go
out.That
means,
the
aerobic
bacteria
will
grow
there
in
a
very
nicest
fashion
and
it
will
actually
consume
the
huge
amount
of
pollutant
from
the
waste
water
and
then
waste
water
once
it
will
be
consumed
this
waste
water
will
go
out
of
the
system
ok.
This
is
called
the
packed
bed
reactor.
Then
there
comes
a
fluidized
bed
reactor
it
is
also
type
of
packed
bed
only
the
only
difference
is
the
it
is
expanded
to
because
of
the
upward
movement
of
the
fluid.
In
case
of
packed
bed
we
are
not
letting
in
general
the
standard
one
the
conventional
one
we
do
not
let
the
bed
to
move
much.
However,
in
case
of
fluidized
bed
the
it
is
looks
like
the
bed
is
in
boiling
it
is
like
you
know
it
is
keep
on
boiling
it
is
like
you
know
I
mean
like
it
is
goes
up
down
like
you
know
there
is
a
certain
movement
this
is
called
the
fluidized
bed
as
if
like
the
bed
is
in
fluidized
condition
ok.
And
because
of
the
it
can
be
done
because
of
the
flow
rate
also
higher
amount
of
flow
rate
that
you
can
maintain
or
there
is
a
chance
because
of
the
aeration
additional
aeration
also
you
can
do
that.
So,
this
is
called
the
fluidized
bed
reactor
ok.
In
this
fluidized
bed
because
of
the
presence
of
fluid
of
the
air
we
make
the
bed
in
a
floating
condition
this
kind
of
like
system
like
or
very
advanced
very
advanced
and
nowadays
people
are
using
it
like
anything.
In
general
the
moving
bed
biofilm
reactor
or
moving
bed
reactor
this
is
also
called
the
this
fluidized
bed
is
also
type
moving
bed
is
also
type
of
fluidized
bed
reactor.
In
this
concept
nowadays
very
much
encouraged
in
the
washable
treatment
by
properly
selecting
the
media
material
which
has
a
specific
gravity
close
to
that
washed
water.
So,
that
it
will
make
this
flotation
possible
I
mean
like
floating
thingy
like
fluidized
thingy
possible.
So,
these
are
the
different
types
of
reactor
that
we
discussed.
It
is
very
important
for
you
to
understand
this
different
types
of
reactor
ok.
So,
first
one
we
you
remember
batch
reactor
it
is
like
fill
and
draw
type,
second
one
we
discuss
the
continuous
flow
type,
third
one
we
discuss
about
the
plug
one
you
enter
the
it
will
take
exact
amount
of
time
to
it
will
stay
there
and
the
next
batch
will
go
from
the
other
side
of
it
ok.
This
is
called
the
plug
flow
reactor,
fourth
one
is
arbitrary
flow
reactor,
fifth
one
is
packed
bed
reactor
and
the
sixth
one
is
fluidized
bed
reactor.
Placked
bed
how
it
is
very
hard
to
treat
it
in
a
very
hard
to
because
it
may
get
like
you
know
how
to
say
clogged
very
easily
there
is
a
chance.
In
order
to
reduce
the
clogging
and
all
this
phenomena
fluidized
beds
are
installed
like
introduced
ok.
So,
good
that
you
understand
the
basics
of
different
kind
of
reactors
you
understand
the
necessity
of
different
type
of
order
of
reactions
and
what
is
the
order
of
reaction
in
the
biological
stabilization
processes
and
the
value
the
order
of
reactions
denoted
at
n
can
be
varying
from
0
order
where
the
reaction
rate
is
constant
to
first
order
where
the
rate
is
proportional
to
the
substance
concentration.
Sometimes
it
can
be
also
the
value
can
bealso
to
in
some
specific
type
of
trickling
filters
and
all
ok
that
also
we
discussed.
We
also
discussed
the
different
environmental
parameters
how
those
can
affect
the
reaction
rate
constant
and
also
the
reactors
used
in
the
wastewater
treatment
can
be
classified
into
various
types
including
batch,
plug
flow,
continuous
mix,
arbitrary,
packed
bed
and
fluidized
bed
ok
very
good.
So,
we
understand
it
is
a
it
is
a
very
crucial
to
understand
this
this
informations
this
is
the
references
that
can
be
followed
to
understand
it
more
in
details.
So,
I
hope
you
got
to
know
some
very
interesting
nomenclatures
and
also
understand
something
very
new
in
this
lecture
module.
We
will
be
discussing
more
in
details
about
all
this
informations
in
the
coming
lecture,
but
before
that
I
would
like
to
request
you
to
please
go
through
this
lecture
once
more
to
you
know
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
nomenclature
of
the
discussions
that
we
had
and
if
you
have
any
queries
and
all
please
raise
it
in
the
forum
in
our
in
the
NPTEL
module
and
all
ok.
Thank
you
so
much
see
you
in
the
next
lecture
video.
