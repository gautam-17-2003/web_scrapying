Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav,
Professor
Gaurav
Dhar
Bhaumik.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology.
In
this
lecture
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
USB
reactor,
the
design
of
anaerobic
reactors
majorly
the
airflow
anaerobic
sludge
blanket
reactor.
So,
this
design
and
the
one
numerical
design
will
be
solving
in
like
in
the
coming
lecture.
Design
part
will
do
it
today
I
mean
like
the
functionality
and
all
we
will
discuss
about
it
today
and
in
the
coming
lecture
we
will
be
solving
one
problem
design
problem.
So,
that
it
will
be
will
be
able
to
do
it
in
a
real
life
situation
and
we
will
be
doing
it
like
you
know
in
how
it
is
to
be
done
and
it
is
not
that
difficult
once
you
will
do
it
you
will
be
able
to
understand
it
much
clearly.
So,
coming
to
today's
lecture
so,
the
concept
that
we
will
be
covering
today
the
design
of
anaerobic
reactors.
The
important
nomenclature
like
the
hydraulic
retention
time,
hydraulic
loading
rate,
organic
loading
rate,
solid
loading
rate
and
the
airflow
velocity
we
all
know
a
bit
about
it
I
will
be
going
through
it
more
in
details
in
today's
lecture.
Design
of
USB
reactor,
the
design
of
the
system,
design
of
the
gas
liquid,
a
solid
separator,
the
effluent
collection
systems,
design
of
feed
inlet
systems
etcetera.
To
start
with
we
all
know
we
already
have
experienced
I
have
been
even
using
this
term
in
the
design
problem.
So,
let
us
let
us
do
a
you
know
quick
check
upon
the
on
the
existing
nomenclatures
that
we
have
already
learned.
The
first
one
is
the
hydraulic
retention
time
in
the
hydraulic
retention
time
it
normally
refers
to
the
average
time
of
residence
of
the
liquid
present
inside
the
reactor.
So,
it
calculated
by
using
the
volume
by
flow
rate.
So,
in
this
figure
if
you
see
it
is
suppose
if
you
have
a
cube
of
cubical
of
200
meter
cube
and
200
cubic
meter
and
you
have
100
meter
cubic
meter
per
hour
of
flow
rate
is
given.
So,
what
will
be
the
hydraulic
retention
time
that
is
θ
=
V/Q
where
it
is
2000
divided
by
100.
So,
that
is
20
hour
this
20
hour
is
then
the
hydraulic
retention
time
or
HRT.
Hydraulic
loading
rate
hydraulic
loading
rate
is
what
it
is
a
load
it
is
means
the
volume
of
wastewater
that
we
apply
per
unit
area
of
filter
packing
medium
of
the
anaerobic
filters
or
any
USB
reactor
what
is
the
total
and
what
is
the
surface
area
that
they
have.
So,
this
hydraulic
loading
rate
which
is
like
nothing,
but
the
can
be
have
an
unit
of
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
which
is
nothing,
butHLR
=
Q/A
Q
is
the
average
inflow
flow
rate
that
is
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
the
surface
area
of
the
packing
medium
or
surface
area
of
the
reactor
this
anaerobic
reactor
ok.
Now
comes
the
organic
loading
rate
organic
loading
rate
means
it
is
the
it
is
simply
the
volumetric
organic
loading
rate
or
simply
organic
loading
rate
or
OLR
also
we
call
it.
It
refers
to
the
load
of
organic
matter
applied
daily
per
unit
volume
of
the
reactor
load
of
organic
matter.
So,
what
is
the
unit
of
organic
matter
BOD
here
right
BOD
or
COD.
So,
what
how
you
will
calculate
it?
So,
you
will
calculate
it
total
organic
matter
that
is
coming
into
the
picture
that
is
say
like
the
inflow
flow
rate
the
inflow
rate
multiplied
by
the
COD
of
the
inflow
COD
of
the
influent
wastewater .
So,
if
you
multiply
the
COD
of
the
influent
wastewater
with
the
inflow
rate.
L
v
=
(Q
×
S
0
)/V
So,
you
will
get
the
total
amount
of
like
you
know
the
organic
load
that
is
coming
into
the
picture
divided
by
the
volume
of
the
reactor.
So,
that
is
the
V
by
this
equation
you
will
be
able
to
understand
the
organic
loading
rate
that
per
unit
volume
how
much
organic
you
are
supplying
to
the
system
ok.
So,
because
it
is
very
important
because
based
on
this
only
the
reactor
performance
will
depend
ok.
Then
there
comes
a
solid
loading
rate.
What
is
a
solid
loading
rate
or
the
sludge
loading
rate?
It
refers
to
the
amount
of
organic
matter
applied
daily
to
the
reactor
per
unit
of
mass
of
biomass
present
in
a
reactor.
L
s
=
(Q
×
S
0
)/M
It
is
more
like
how
much
food
you
are
providing
for
your
microorganisms
with
in
terms
of
amount
of
microorganism
present
as
easy
as
that.
So,
that
is
why
it
sometimes
represents
also
sometimes
known
as
the
food
to
microorganism
ratio
ok.
So,
this
food
to
microorganism
ratio
how
you
are
going
to
calculate
this
food
to
microorganism
ratio?
First
of
all
you
can
you
need
to
calculate
the
amount
of
food
that
you
are
supplying.
What
is
this
amount
of
food
that
is
organic
matter?
It
is
like
the
an
influent
like
flow
rate
average
influent
flow
rate
meter
cube
per
day
multiplied
by
the
influent
substrate
concentration
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
or
gram
per
like
you
know
or
obviously,
if
you
have
a
gram
per
liter
if
you
have
you
know
the
milligram
per
liter
to
gram
per
liter.
Now,
you
use
this
as
0
into
10
to
the
power
minus
3
in
that
case
to
convert
it
into
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube.So,
that
is
the
total
food
and
what
is
the
total
mass
present
there?
I
mean
like
the
unit
mass
of
organism
present
in
the
systems.
This
mass
of
organisms
present
in
the
system
is
the
kg
of
VSS
per
meter
cube.
How
you
will
calculate
this
kg
of
VSS
per
meter
cube?
That
is
nothing,
but
the
mixed
liquor
volatile
suspended
solid
ok.
If
you
calculate
this
mixed
liquor
volatile
suspended
solid
multiplied
by
the
volume
of
the
reactor
this
m
into
the
volume
of
the
reactor
from
there
you
will
get
the
total
amount
of
mass
present
in
the
system
ok.
So,
from
like
using
that
equation
also
you
can
easily
calculate
the
L.
So,
here
the
(Q
×
S
0
)/M
and
if
it
is
possible
some
in
some
cases
you
if
it
is
a
food
to
microorganism
ratio
if
you
talk
about
there
you
need
to
be
specific
about
the
mass
of
microorganisms
present
in
the
reactor
multiplied
by
the
volume
ok.
So,
from
there
you
will
be
able
to
calculate
the
exact
amount
of
the
solid
loading
rate
of
your
system.
Off
flow
velocity
also
known
as
surface
overflow
rate
in
some
cases
what
do
what
do
I
mean
the
off
flow
velocity
suppose
your
wastewater
is
coming
from
the
bottom
and
it
goes
up.
So,
off
flow
velocity
it
is
like
you
know
if
you
have
a
say
a
cylindrical
reactor
you
cut
it
in
like
say
in
you
use
one
cut
sectional
one
cross
sectional
cut
you
if
you
do.
So,
what
will
happen
because
of
through
this
cross
sectional
area
amount
of
how
you
get
the
off
flow
velocity
you
need
to
know
the
flow
rate
say
in
meter
cube
per
hour
and
if
you
know
the
this
area
this
surface
area
ok.
So,
that
is
say
like
something
say
like
some
a
meter
square
meter.
So,
this
Q
meter
cube
cubic
meter
per
day
divided
by
the
a
square
meter
you
will
get
it
in
the
velocity
what
is
the
exact
velocity
of
water
which
is
crossing
that
boundary
crossing
this
each
boundaries
of
this
cut
section
that
is
v
=
Q/A
So,
from
this
equation
you
will
be
able
to
understand
the
off
flow
velocity
or
in
some
cases
it
will
be
considered
the
same
equation
will
be
useful
for
get
in
the
value
of
surface
overflow
rate
ok.
The
V
is
that
off
flow
velocity
and
the
a
Q
is
the
flow
rate
mean
meter
cube
per
hour
a
is
the
area
of
the
cross
sectional
of
the
reactor
or
in
case
the
surface
area
in
some
cases.
Alternatively
this
off
flow
velocity
can
also
be
expressed
by
height
by
h
r
t
how
because
if
you
see
Q
by
V
a
right
V
equal
to
Q
by
a,
a
means
V
by
h
volume
by
height
so,
the
volume
will
stay
in
the
bottom
h
will
go
to
the
numerator
ok.
So,
in
the
numerator
it
now
it
will
become
v
=
(Q
×
H)/V
=
H/
θNow
Q
by
V
means
or
V
by
Q
means
we
already
calculated
what
is
the
how
we
will
calculate
this
hydraulic
retention
time
volume
by
the
flow
rate.
So,
same
way
V
by
Q
in
the
bottom
you
will
replace
it
with
the
theta
that
is
the
h
r
t.
So,
V
equal
to
capital
H
by
theta
the
height
of
the
reactor
divided
by
h
r
t.
So,
if
you
know
the
height
of
the
reactor
if
you
know
the
h
r
t
you
will
be
easily
tell
the
what
will
be
the
velocity
off
flow
velocity
same
way
as
Q
by
a
ok.
Sludge
production
sludge
production
in
it
is
always
represents
by
this
equation
7,
P
s
=
Y
×
COD
rem
where
P
s
is
the
select
production
of
biosolid
in
the
system
in
kg
of
V
s
s
per
day
and
y
is
the
sludge
yield
or
the
production
coefficient
in
kg
of
V
s
s
per
kg
of
COD
remaining
and
COD
remaining
is
the
COD
load
that
removed
or
from
the
system
in
kg
of
COD.
So,
values
of
y
it
is
actually
normally
normally
stays
between
1
0.06
to
0.15
kg
of
V
s
s
per
kg
of
COD
removed
ok.
So,
this
equation
you
remember
it
will
be
useful
for
calculating
the
sludge
production.
What
will
be
the
biogash
production?
How
you
will
be
able
to
quantify
the
biogash
production?
It
is
by
equation
COD
CH4
=
Q
×
(S
0
−S)
−
Y
obs
×
Q
×
(S
0
−S)
Whereas,
the
COD
with
this
Q
is
the
average
influent
flow
S
0
and
S
is
the
influent
and
effluent
COD
concentration
in
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
and
y
OBS
is
the
coefficient
of
solid
produced
in
the
system
production
in
the
system
in
terms
of
COD
that
normally
stays
0.08
to
2
0.20
kg
of
COD
sludge
per
kg
of
COD
removed
ok.
When
we
design
a
USB
reactor
now
we
discuss
about
all
the
nomenclature
very
important
nomenclature
already.
Now,
let
us
focus
on
the
design
of
an
of
a
of
an
USB
reactor.
So,
when
we
design
of
a
of
flow
anaerobic
sludge
blanket
reactor
higher
loading
rate
it
is
initially
not
possible,
but
in
in
some
cases
theoretically
compared
to
the
activator
sludge
process
or
other
aerobic
treatment
processes
higher
loading
rate
is
compared
to
those
there
is
there
is
there
are
the
loading
rate
can
be
very
high
in
case
of
USB
systems
and
all.
When
we
design
the
USB
reactor
the
COD
concentration
of
this
reactor
wastewater
is
normally
suitably
divided
into
4
categories
to
propose
the
adapt
loading
condition
as
you
can
see
in
this
table.
Low
strength
the
COD
if
it
is
less
than
750
milligram
per
liter
where
we
can
find
this
in
thesewage
in
the
sewage
the
municipal
sewage
it
never
goes
more
than
750
milligram
per
liter
of
COD.
So,
in
that
case
it
is
a
low
strength
wastewater .
So,
in
this
case
organic
loading
rate
of
1
to
3
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day
is
enough
and
solid
loading
rate
of
0.1
to
0.4
kg
of
COD
per
kg
of
VSS
per
day
is
good
and
with
an
HRT
of
6
to
18
hours
is
sufficient
and
liquid
airflow
velocity
has
to
be
maintained
between
0.25
to
0.7
meter
per
hour
ok.
So,
in
case
of
medium
strength
wastewater
like
when
the
wastewater
COD
in
the
influence
COD
in
let
us
influence
COD
will
range
between
750
to
3000
milligram
per
liter.
In
that
case
the
organic
loading
rate
should
be
225
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day,
the
solid
loading
rate
should
be
0.2
to
0.5
kg
of
COD
per
kg
of
VSS
per
day
and
HRT
will
be
6
to
24
hour
and
with
a
liquid
airflow
velocity
of
0.25
to
0.7
meter
per
hour.
In
case
of
high
strength
it
will
be
somewhere
between
3000
to
10000
if
it
is
more
than
10000
if
it
is
a
it
is
a
very
high
strength
ok.
Like
the
tannery
wastewater
like
the
processing
wastewater
there
is
it
is
possible
to
have
a
very
high
petroleum
wastewater .
So,
it
may
have
a
very
high
strength
of
wastewater
these
are
very
high
strength
wastewater
it
may
have
COD
more
than
12000,
15000,
20,000,
30,000
something
like
that
ok.
So,
in
this
cases
the
organic
loading
rate
should
be
as
high
as
5
to
15
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day,
SLR
can
be
0.2
to
1
kg
of
COD
per
kg
of
VSS
per
day,
HRT
can
be
as
high
as
240
hour
that
means,
for
10
days
as
at
all
as
well.
And
also
the
liquids
of
offload
velocity
of
0.05
to
0.3
that
has
to
be
maintained
because
it
should
be
very
much
reduced
to
increase
the
chances
of
the
consumption
of
this
pollutant
by
the
microorganism
present
in
the
USB
system
ok.
In
general
the
based
on
the
recommendation
of
HRT
and
the
offload
velocity
from
this
table
you
will
choose
the
height
and
the
area
you
will
work
out
the
height
and
the
area
required
for
the
reactor.
Also
based
on
the
suitable
value
of
OLR
this
organic
loading
rate
from
this
equation
from
this
table
the
volume
on
the
reactor
applied
can
be
easily
estimated
by
equation
3
at
the
given
COD
concentration.
If
you
remember
in
this
equation
3
we
from
here
if
you
know
the
organic
loading
rate
we
can
easily
calculate
the
volume
of
the
reactor
ok.
Then
the
suitable
SLR
if
for
the
suitable
SLR
we
can
calculate
we
can
choose
it
from
this
table
and
from
there
we
can
easily
calculate
the
we
can
easily
work
out
the
average
concentration
of
VSS
which
should
be
between
25
to
35
gram
per
liter
in
case
of
medium
and
high
strength
waste
water
and
for
from
20
15
to
25
gram
per
liter
in
case
of
low
strength
waste
water
ok.
The
HRT
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
less
than
6
hour
in
any
cases
typically
it
should
be
somewhere
around
8
to
10
hour
that
is
like
a
normal
practice
for
low
or
medium
strength
waste
water
ok.
Volume
of
sludge
it
should
be
less
than
20
50
to
60
percent
of
the
reactorvolume
estimated
based
on
the
OLR
to
avoid
the
overloading
of
the
reactor
with
the
respect
to
SLR
otherwise
reduce
the
organic
loading
rate
in
case
if
you
cannot
do
that.
At
very
high
a
flow
velocity
greater
than
1
to
1.5
meter
per
hour
the
inoculum
may
get
washed
out
during
the
startup.
So,
that
is
why
you
should
not
be
in
any
case
the
a
flow
velocity
liquid
a
flow
velocity
should
not
exit
more
than
1.2
to
1.5
meter
per
hour.
The
a
flow
velocity
in
the
range
of
0.2
to
0.8
meter
per
hour
are
favorable
for
granular
biomass
growth
and
maximum
a
flow
velocity
of
1.5
meter
per
hour
should
be
checked
for
peak
flow
condition
ok.
But
a
taller
reactor
can
be
designed
to
reduce
the
plane
area
and
also
cost
of
GLS
device
and
influence
distribution
arrangement,
but
you
cannot
go
beyond
a
certain
limit
ok.
So,
you
cannot
in
general
to
minimize
the
channeling
of
minimum
depth
of
the
sludge
bed
of
around
1.5
meter
is
present
we
normally
consider
and
in
that
case
the
minimum
height
of
the
reactor
should
be
restricted
to
4
meter.
Preferably
the
maximum
height
should
be
8
meter
and
in
between
8
meter
like
4.5
to
8
meter
and
6
meter
is
typically
used
for
design
of
the
USB
reactors
ok.
After
finalizing
the
volume
and
now
the
height
now
the
plane
area
can
be
easily
worked
out
and
based
on
that
suitable
design
of
the
dimension
of
the
reactor
can
be
adopted.
Maximum
diameter
of
this
or
the
side
length
of
single
reactor
should
be
kept
less
than
20
meter
ok.
Now,
the
design
of
the
gas
liquid
solid
separator
on
the
top
that
is
like
a
dome
like
structure.
You
see
this
picture
in
this
picture
this
h
and
the
del
h
those
are
the
very
important
height
of
the
dome
and
the
the
wt
which
is
like
the
available
area
for
the
biogas
collection
in
the
in
the
the
width
of
the
dome
each
dome
each
GLS
separator
is
wb
with
the
theta
is
the
angle
of
inclination
and
wa
is
the
settling
compartment.
You
see
in
the
settling
compartment
this
is
the
aperture
like
you
know
length
that
is
available
or
the
width
that
is
available
for
the
settling
phenomena
to
happen
it
will
to
for
the
effluent
to
reach
the
that
side
of
the
that
side
of
the
chamber.
Then
in
the
bottom
you
have
a
deflector
in
the
deflector
what
is
happening
that
is
that
the
deflector
the
width
should
be
wa
that
aperture
width
plus
0.02
meter.
And
this
way
and
this
is
the
in
the
right
side
in
the
in
the
left
side
if
you
see
this
is
the
side
wall
of
the
USB
reactor.
So,
if
you
see
in
this
case
the
aperture
width
is
2
into
wa
right
because
wa
in
the
bottom
and
half
of
wa
in
the
left
side
and
the
half
of
w
in
the
right
side
that
aperture
width.
So,
total
width
total
in
case
of
2
number
of
dome
the
total
number
of
like
the
aperture
will
be
total
width
of
the
aperture
will
be
wa
2
into
wa
ok.
So,
this
is
you
picturize
this
thing
this
wa
is
very
important
wb
is
very
important
the
the
GLS
at
the
each
domes
the
width
of
each
dome
wt
is
very
important
this
the
width
of
the
biogas
collection
line
h
is
very
important
h
is
the
height
of
the
GLS
separator
and
the
del
h
that
will
also
be
useful.
So,when
we
design
a
GLS
separator
of
this
short
so,
that
the
what
is
what
is
the
purpose
of
GLS
separator.
So,
that
the
when
the
gas
liquid
solid
this
mixture
will
come
in
contact
with
this
systems
because
of
a
certain
slope
and
all
what
will
happen
the
liquid
and
solid
will
start
settling
the
liquid
will
obviously,
like
the
solid
will
start
settling
down
and
the
liquid
and
the
gas
and
liquid
because
of
this
deflectors
and
all
because
of
the
presence
of
this
dome
this
gaseous
will
escape
from
the
system.
So,
it
will
escape
from
the
systems
and
will
have
to
maintain
a
certain
surface
overflow
rate.
So,
that
the
water
will
not
be
able
to
escape,
but
I
mean
like
water
will
escape
from
the
effluent
line,
but
it
will
not
be
carrying
more
amount
of
biogas.
So,
it
will
release
the
maximum
amount
of
biogas
possible
from
its
from
we
have
to
design
it
in
such
a
way
ok.
So,
this
is
how
the
gas
liquid
a
solid
separator
is
designed.
If
you
see
we
when
we
design
a
gas
liquid
separator
we
have
to
provide
enough
gas
water
interface
area
inside
this
gas
dome.
So,
that
this
interface
will
act
as
you
know
so,
release
the
help
the
help
releasing
the
gases
from
the
gas
collection
line.
It
should
provide
sufficient
settling
area
outside
the
biogas
collection
dome
to
control
the
surface
overflow
rate.
It
should
provide
sufficient
aperture
opening
at
the
bottom
to
avoid
the
turbulence
due
to
high
inlet
velocity
because
this
what
will
happen
when
the
surface
area
is
small
the
water
will
go
it
will
rush
right
the
velocity
will
increase.
So,
and
because
of
that
there
may
be
chances
of
generation
of
turbulence
we
do
not
want
that.
So,
because
of
that
we
need
to
provide
sufficient
this
opening
of
this
aperture.
The
gas
water
interface
inside
the
gas
collection
dome
is
considered
to
be
the
depth
of
del
H
you
see
this
is
the
area
where
this
gas
water
interface
inside
the
biogas
collection
dome
is
considered
in
the
figure.
In
del
H
normally
is
provided
in
the
range
of
0.3
to
0.5
meter
at
the
beginning
the
height
of
the
GLS
separator
can
be
considered
as
25
percentage
of
the
total
reactor
height.
So,
total
reactor
height
if
it
is
4
meter
the
gas
the
H
value
will
be
1
meter
that
means,
almost
1
meter
of
dome
height
should
be
provided
GLS
separator
should
be
provided
height
of
the
GLS
separator.
The
angle
of
inclination
it
is
better
to
be
kept
between
45
to
75
70
degree
so,
that
enough
amount
of
slope
is
provided
for
the
sludge
to
settle
on
the
bottom
solid
to
settle
on
the
bottom
and
that
area
that
will
be
used
for
you
know
the
separation
of
a
biogas
from
the
liquid.
How
we
can
estimate
the
number
of
domes
required?
Initial
angle
of
the
dome
say
like
assume
45
degree
ok.
Now
the
base
width
of
the
dome
the
W
b
can
be
easily
estimated
by
this
equation
2
into
H
plus
del
H
divided
by
tan
theta
isn't
it.
So,number
of
domes
that
is
required
for
any
given
diameter
per
length
is
can
be
estimated
by
dividing
the
reactor
length
or
diameter
by
W
b
ok.
Since
W
b
is
the
W
small
b
and
W
small
a
this
small
b
is
the
width
of
the
aperture
opening
and
can
be
0.2
to
0.3
ok.
And
this
W
b
the
total
is
W
capital
B
is
W
small
b
that
is
the
width
of
the
each
GLS
separator
and
W
is
the
width
of
the
aperture
opening
ok.
So,
now
the
area
of
aperture
what
is
the
area
of
aperture
it
is
normally
computed
on
the
minimum
on
the
basis
of
the
maximum
inlet
velocity
of
a
liquid
to
be
allowed
and
it
is
essential
for
proportional
flow
rate
per
settling
zone
in
case
of
rectangular
reactor
or
central
settling
zone
in
case
of
circular
reactor
divided
by
the
maximum
velocity
to
be
allowed.
The
maximum
inlet
velocity
should
be
kept
around
less
than
3
meter
per
hour
which
is
considered
as
safe
for
medium
and
high
strength
waste
water
as
well
ok.
The
width
of
the
aperture
width
of
this
aperture
W
a
it
is
computed
as
aperture
area
divided
by
width
of
the
width
or
the
diameter
of
the
reactor
minimum
aperture
width
of
0.2
meter
is
recommended
the
number
of
domes
are
increased
if
width
are
required
more
than
0.5
meter.
So,
if
it
is
more
if
it
is
required
more
than
0.5
meter
you
have
to
increase
the
number
of
dome
in
the
system.
The
gas
production
is
expected
in
this
in
USB
reactor
can
be
estimated
based
on
the
OLR
selected
for
the
design
and
expected
COD
removal
efficiency
which
is
in
the
range
of
70
to
90
percent
in
general.
And
from
there
you
will
be
able
to
understand
the
smith
and
production
which
is
can
be
easily
estimated
by
0.35
meter
cube
per
kg
of
COD
removed
ok.
In
case
of
ambient
temperature
and
methane
content
of
65
to
70
percentage
in
biogas.
From
the
methane
production
at
in
the
biogas
collection
per
dome
we
can
easily
estimate
by
in
proportional
to
the
percentage
of
area
covered
by
the
dome.
And
this
biogas
loading
at
this
gas
water
interface
is
estimated
by
gas
collection
per
dome
divided
by
area.
And
the
loading
of
biogas
as
the
gas
water
interface
should
be
kept
between
less
than
the
80
meter
cube
cubic
meter
of
biogas
per
square
meter
per
day
which
is
about
3
meter
per
hour
ok.
Top
width
this
Wt
is
normally
kept
point
in
between
0.3
to
0.6
and
adapted
in
a
design
with
a
maximum
of
1
meter
that
is
the
top
width
of
the
this
GLS
separator
Wt
which
is
also
like
the
area
which
is
available
for
the
gas
to
escape
from
the
system
ok.
If
the
biogas
loading
is
greater
than
3
meter
per
hour
we
should
reduce
the
height
of
the
GLS
separator
device
to
at
least
20
percentage
and
repeat
the
earlier
steps
to
design
the
and
design
and
finalize
the
fresh
number
of
domes
required.
In
some
cases
we
also
provide
additional
layer
of
gas
collector
domes
if
the
checks
are
you
know
like
not
satisfying
even
with
the
reduction
in
height
of
the
GLS
separator.
When
two
or
more
layers
of
gas
collectors
are
used
with
the
height
of
each
layer
can
be
15
to
20
percent
of
the
overall
reactor
height
with
minimum
height
of
each
layer
is
1.2
meter
and
maximum
of
maximum
up
to
2
meter
ok.
So,
if
this
typical
two
layer
dome
structure
nowadays
started
becoming
quite
popular
and
this
providing
this
multi
layer
domes
it
can
keep
the
biogasloading
under
control
at
gas
water
interface
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater
with
a
COD
greater
than
10000
milligram
per
liter
that
means,
it
is
a
high
strength
wastewater
ok.
Excessive
gas
loading
at
this
gas
water
interface
which
lead
to
the
severe
foam
formations
and
this
turbulence
will
push
the
sludge
particles
in
the
gas
collection
pipe
along
with
the
foam
leading
to
the
gas
pipe
blockage
on
the
top
of
it
is
Wt
part
you
know.
The
width
of
the
water
surface
Ws
can
be
estimated
by
difference
of
total
length
of
reactor
minus
the
total
top
width
of
the
dome
and
then
divided
with
the
number
of
biogas
collection
dome
from
there
you
can
easily
calculate
the
width
of
the
water
surface
ok.
The
surface
overflow
rate
it
is
normally
estimated
by
hydraulic
flow
rate
per
dome
divided
by
the
area
of
the
settling
compartment.
We
discuss
about
it
remember
of
flow
velocity
this
surface
overflow
rate
this
way
also
we
can
calculate
it
by
just
we
just
need
to
provide
the
flow
find
out
the
hydraulic
flow
rate
divided
by
the
this
area
of
settling
compartment.
For
effective
settling
of
solid
surface
overflow
rate
should
be
less
than
20
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
at
average
flow
and
36
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day
in
case
of
peak
flow
conditions
ok.
The
minimum
height
should
be
restricted
to
4.5
meter
it
is
possible
with
4
meter
also
is
there
in
some
cases.
Deflector
baffles
of
sufficient
overlap
of
say
like
0.1
to
0.2
meter
should
be
provided
below
the
aperture
between
the
gas
collectors
to
avoid
the
entry
of
the
biogas
as
we
design.
As
you
can
see
in
the
earlier
figure
the
diameter
of
the
gas
exhaust
pipe
which
should
be
sufficient
to
guarantee
the
easy
removal
of
the
biogas
from
the
gas
collection
dome
in
ease
of
foaming
I
mean
like
so,
that
it
will
not
lead
to
the
froth
formation
on
the
top
of
it
ok.
Now,
the
effluent
collection
system
if
you
see
this
picture
in
the
left
side
say
like
in
the
on
the
inside
where
there
is
like
you
know
first
we
have
the
baffle
like
structure
then
we
have
this
you
know
this
90
degree
this
v
notches
this
v
notches
and
then
there
is
a
one
small
channel
and
this
after
the
channel
there
is
this
baffle
after
the
baffle
also
you
see
this
inside
of
the
reactor
in
the
left
side.
In
the
right
side
you
have
this
launders
effluent
launders
after
the
effluent
launders
water
is
collected
from
the
other
side
of
it.
In
the
this
side
in
the
left
side
we
have
this
waste
effluent
I
mean
like
the
USB
on
the
top
of
it
then
it
will
cross
the
this
baffles
after
this
baffles
you
have
a
certain
drainage
line
and
from
there
then
it
will
cross
this
v
notches
after
v
notch
it
will
there
is
a
cemented
laundering
structures
launders
we
call
it
this
launders
after
the
launders
it
will
reach
to
the
effluent
line
ok.
So,
in
general
we
provide
this
effluent
launders
which
are
designed
in
such
a
way
thattheir
wire
loading
should
be
should
not
exceed
the
maximum
value
which
is
185
meter
cube
per
meter
of
launder
per
day
ok.
The
width
of
this
effluent
collection
launders
may
be
maximum
minimum
of
0.2
meter
to
facilitate
the
cleaning
and
the
maintenance
and
the
depth
of
this
laundered
is
estimated
using
the
open
channel
flow
designs.
Additional
depth
of
0.1
to
0.4
meter
should
be
provided
to
facilitate
the
free
fall
of
treated
wastewater
into
the
launder
system
you
see
this
structure
is
given.
Additional
depth
of
the
on
both
side
of
the
launder
v
notches
should
be
provided
at
point
at
15
to
15
20
centimeter
center
to
center
distance.
That
means,
on
one
top
of
this
v
notch
to
another
top
of
v
it
is
the
distance
is
15
to
20
centimeter
ok.
When
effluent
launders
are
provided
with
scum
baffle
this
v
notches
will
be
protected
from
clogging
as
the
baffle
will
retain
the
floating
materials.
If
you
see
in
this
case
as
I
told
the
baffle
will
retain
the
floating
materials
then
there
is
a
certain
drop
and
then
this
water
will
pass
through
this
launder.
So,
this
additional
structure
this
v
notch
it
be
this
v
notches
will
not
be
affected
which
will
not
be
clogged
by
the
floating
materials.
A
scum
layer
may
form
on
the
top
of
the
reactor
and
sludge
accumulation
can
occur
in
the
launder.
So,
hence
the
periodical
cleaning
of
launder
and
as
well
as
the
removal
of
scum
from
the
top
from
the
surface
of
the
wastewater
I
mean
surface
of
this
USV
reactor
should
be
carried
out.
Design
of
the
feed
inlet
systems
which
is
very
important
proper
design
of
the
inlet
distribution
system
is
very
much
important
for
establishing
optimal
contact
between
the
sludge
available
inside
the
USV
reactor
and
the
organic
matter
present
in
the
wastewater .
Optimal
contact
it
will
help
the
channeling
the
wastewater
through
the
sludge
bed
and
normally
it
is
done
by
there
by
gravity
fed
from
the
top
or
pump
fed
from
the
bottom
only
through
manifold
of
the
laterals.
It
is
always
preferred
in
case
of
soluble
industrial
wastewater
this
pump
fed
ones,
but
in
case
of
gravity
fed
is
much
more
preferred
in
case
of
wastewater
with
the
high
suspended
solid
ok.
So,
what
is
happening
you
see
this
picture
this
is
this
picture
this
structure
is
called
the
splitter
box
ok.
This
is
called
the
flow
splitter
box
it
is
splitting
the
flow
from
the
bottom
actually
say
it
is
in
the
from
the
bottom
you
see
this
main
feeder
pipe
and
the
top
of
it
you
see
like
you
know
it
is
there
is
a
cover
is
there
and
it
is
it
is
connected
to
the
this
collection
system.
There
is
a
pump
which
will
lift
the
water
from
the
reservoir
this
wastewater
reservoir
and
it
will
pump
the
water
to
through
or
it
is
quite
a
good
amount
of
height
it
will
be
placed
on
top
of
the
USB
reactor
ok.
So,
if
the
USB
reactor
has
a
say
like
8
say
5
meter
height
or
6
meter
height
this
distribution
system
thisgravity
fed
inlet
distribution
systems
or
the
splitter
box
should
be
even
present
a
placed
on
top
of
it
on
top
of
this
6
meter
ok.
And
then
the
what
will
happen
the
wastewater
will
enter
I
mean
the
wastewater
will
be
pumped
through
this
main
feeder
pipe
and
it
will
flow
like
you
know
like
a
tiny
bit
of
a
fountain
on
right
next
to
it
and
then
it
will
fill
up
the
first
the
central
box
will
fill
up
and
then
it
will
be
equally
distributed
because
of
the
design
it
will
be
equally
distributed
into
this
12
number
of
different
boxes
you
see
there
are
12
boxes
are
there.
In
this
12
boxes
the
and
from
this
box
also
this
center
in
there
is
a
hole
flow
distribution
holes
are
there
which
is
connected
with
a
pipe
that
pipe
will
go
and
connect
in
the
directly
into
the
center
and
just
in
the
bottom
of
the
USB
reactor.
This
is
how
the
feed
is
inlet
a
feed
is
actually
distributed
in
the
USB
reactor.
In
general
the
area
served
per
inlet
point
should
be
between
1
to
3
square
meter
the
lower
area
per
inlet
points
about
1
square
meter
is
provided
for
reactor
design
for
lower
organic
loading
rate
and
higher
area
2
to
3
square
meter
per
inlet
point
for
organic
loading
rate
of
2
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day.
You
understand
this
inlet
point
right
like
the
number
of
inlet
point
will
definitely
vary
with
this
number
of
distribution
pipe
here
in
this
case
12
distribution
pipes
are
there.
So,
it
will
be
connected
with
the
12
number
of
inlet
point
ok.
So,
your
reactor
will
be
having
12
inlet
point
in
this
case
minimum
and
maximum
offload
velocity
through
this
feed
inlet
nozzles
should
be
considered
the
offload
velocity
of
this
nozzles
always
should
be
kept
well
in
between
0.5
to
4
meter
per
second
and
the
nozzle
with
the
diameter
of
less
than
20
millimeter
shall
be
avoided
due
to
the
possibility
of
clogging.
So,
it
should
be
much
more
than
that.
The
this
in
this
case
the
pictures
are
actually
for
demonstration
purpose
this
kind
of
this
kind
of
nozzles
cannot
be
used
actually
theoretically
speaking
it
is
impossible
almost
impossible
to
use
it
for
USB
reactors
you
can
have
those
nozzles
which
are
having
much
higher
you
know
the
nozzle
diameter
and
all
ok.
The
nozzle
in
the
equation
of
condition
for
maximum
power
transfer
through
the
series
of
nozzles
should
be
used
for
working
out
the
diameter
of
the
manifold
or
the
main
feeder
pipe
in
case
of
pump
feeding.
Number
of
laterals
which
attach
to
this
main
feeder
lines
are
located
on
the
specific
specified
spacing
on
this
later
clogging
of
this
nozzles
may
result
in
uneven
distribution.
So,
we
have
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
clogging
phenomena.
The
arrangement
should
be
provided
for
facilitating
cleaning
and
flushing
of
this
influent
distribution
systems
and
this
nozzles
are
normally
provided
at
the
downward
direction
with
the
angle
of
40
to
30to
45
degree
to
the
bottom
surface
of
the
your
USB
reactor
ok.
So,
in
case
to
avoid
the
blockage
in
case
the
lateral
is
touching
the
floor
of
the
reactor.
So,
in
conclusion
we
get
to
know
about
the
design
we
get
to
know
clear
our
concept
about
how
USB
reactor
looks
like
and
what
are
the
different
design
considerations.
It
may
still
you
may
still
feel
like
little
bit
confused
little
bit
skeptical
because
of
the
design
issues
that
involves
it
will
be
much
more
clearer
to
you
in
the
coming
lecture
once
we
will
actually
design
a
USB
reactor
then
it
will
be
much
more
clearer
to
you
will
be
able
to
actually
do
it
by
yourself
ok.
So,
do
not
get
confused
do
not
get
like
you
know
frightened
this
USB
reactor
it
has
a
lot
of
component,
but
it
is
quite
easy
to
design
and
we
are
not
asking
you
to
remember
it
this
kind
of
whenever
you
have
issues
whenever
you
were
asked
you
will
become
an
engineer
and
like
say
you
will
become
an
water
engineer
and
you
will
be
asked
by
your
client
to
design
a
USB
reactor
you
can
just
go
through
this
manual
this
papers
that
I
have
referred
to
in
this
material
in
this
lecture
plus
you
can
also
follow
the
this
lecture
video
just
go
through
this
lecture
video
this
one
and
the
next
one
you
will
be
able
to
understand
what
are
the
design
criteria
that
we
need
to
understand.
So,
it
is
not
a
very
rocket
science
it
is
very
easy,
but
it
need
involves
certain
involvement
ok.
So,
you
have
to
understand
the
you
have
to
write
it
down
this
whole
concept
it
should
be
better
for
you.
You
follow
this
both
the
papers
both
these
papers
and
the
books.
Thank
you
so
much.
So,
we
will
see
you
in
the
coming
lecture
with
the
design
of
this
USB
reactor
and
we
will
do
it
by
ourselves.
So,
it
will
be
easier
for
us
to
you
know
apprehend
that
how
that
USB
look
like
and
actually
how
to
actually
what
are
the
different
components
that
it
involves
ok.
So,
very
good.
So,
have
to
see
you
in
the
coming
lecture.
Thank
you
so
much.
