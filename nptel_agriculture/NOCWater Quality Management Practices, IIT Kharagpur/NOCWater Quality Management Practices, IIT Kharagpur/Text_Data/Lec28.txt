Role
of
enzymes
and
algae
in
biological
wastewater
treatment
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharbomik
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology
Kharagpur .
So,
in
this
particular
lecture
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
role
of
enzymes
and
the
algae
in
biological
wastewater
treatment
which
is
a
part
of
the
module
6
Fundamentals
and
Principles
of
Biological
wastewater
treatment.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture
video
lecture
material
I
would
say
like
in
we
will
be
covering
the
concepts
like
the
enzymes
and
their
mechanisms
of
enzymatic
reactions.
The
selection
of
enzymes
for
treatment
of
wastewater
the
different
enzyme
models,
the
role
of
microbial
enzyme
for
wastewater
treatment,
enhancing
the
wastewater
treatment
efficiency
using
enzyme,
algae
and
their
use
in
wastewater
remediation,
types
of
algae
used
in
wastewater
treatment,
application
of
algae
in
wastewater
treatment
etcetera.
To
start
with
we
all
know
that
what
is
a
what
is
an
enzyme.
It
is
a
it
is
a
actually
nothing,
but
a
versatile
high
molecular
weighted
proteins
ranging
from
1000
to
almost
20
lakh
Dalton
used
by
living
cells
that
act
as
efficient
biocatalyst
for
cellular
reactions
and
all.
So,
they
processes
highly
rated
catalytic
properties
compared
to
other
chemical
catalyst
because
this
is
considered
as
one
of
the
finest
biocatalyst
possible
and
it
actually
degrade
the
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater
and
produces
the
biological
macromolecules
from
this
from
the
complex
molecules
and
all.
It
generally
it
consists
of
at
least
one
polypeptide
myotene
and
it
is
normally
made
up
of
different
amino
acids
group
if
you
can
see
this
picture
in
this
primary
structure
of
an
enzyme.
So,
which
normally
associated
with
some
amide
or
the
peptide
bond
in
a
linear
chain
ok.
So,
what
are
the
advantages
of
this
bacterial
enzymatic
enzymes
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater?
Because
first
of
all
whenever
we
use
the
a
bacterial
enzyme
and
use
this
kind
of
enzyme
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater ,
it
normally
produces
the
pollutant
load
like
anything.
It
require
very
low
energy
because
it
is
a
biological
process.
It
is
cost
effective
and
it
they
cannot
complete
with
they
cannot
normally
compete
with
other
microbial
forms.
Hence
higher
performance
is
there
and
they
have
higher
reaction
kinetics
and
it
work
under
the
mild
reaction
conditions
like
you
know
like
ambient
temperature
or
the
pH.
Different
macro
and
microor ganisms
like
bacteria,
fungi,
nutrients
produces
enzymes
which
is
a
wide
scope
of
uses
across
the
industries
whether
it
be
food,
textile
etcetera.And
also
they
are
easily
adaptable
to
the
different
harsh
conditions
of
the
environment
and
all
ok.
So,
that
is
the
reason
why
we
need
to
go
ahead
with
the
enzymatic
processes
in
the
treatment
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater
and
which
is
very
widespread
in
nowadays
in
different
advanced
wastewater
treatment
systems
and
all.
So,
how
we
need
to
understand
that
how
this
enzymatic
action
takes
place,
how
enzymes
actually
works
on
treating
the
wastewater
pollutant,
the
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater
and
how
it
actually
performs.
First
one
first
of
all
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
an
enzyme
and
the
substrate
interaction.
The
catalytic
reaction
that
occurs
it
can
be
it
is
normally
it
normally
occurs
on
the
active
or
the
catalytic
site.
We
normally
call
the
active
site
of
enzymes
ok,
which
is
normally
constituted
of
some
amino
acid
joined
through
several
peptide
chains
and
all.
In
this
catalytic
site
or
this
active
sites,
the
side
chains
of
the
amino
acid
residue
provide
the
enzymatic
group
to
bind
with
a
specific
group
of
substrate
ok.
The
enzyme
normally
create
a
transition
state
complex
during
this
catalytic
reaction
and
it
returns
to
its
original
state
after
the
disassociation
of
the
products
in
the
reactions.
So,
so
there
are
two
different
models
which
are
mostly
very
famous
when
which
actually
very
nicely
describe
the
mechanism
of
enzymatic
reactions.
First
one
is
the
Fisher
template
model
or
also
known
as
the
lock
and
key
mechanism
lock
and
key
model
and
the
second
one
is
the
induced
feed
model
and
all
ok.
As
you
can
see
in
this
picture,
so
I
will
be
discussing
about
it
more
in
the
coming
in
the
coming
slide.
So,
we
will
be
able
to
understand
that
how
actually
this
Fisher
template
model
and
the
induced
feed
model
actually
works.
From
the
picture
you
can
see
the
enzyme
in
the
picture
a
enzyme
and
substrate.
So,
enzyme
has
a
particular
active
sites
which
is
exactly
designed
to
feed
the
substrate
like
a
lock
and
key
mechanism
and
that
is
why
the
enzymatic
substrate
complex
actually
performs
it
generates.
And
this
way
they
actually
consume
the
they
actually
reduces
the
pollutant
load
in
the
system.
But
induced
feed
model
says
that
the
active
site
is
not
fixed,
it
is
like
lightly
you
know
fixable
they
actually
fix
it
according
to
the
availability
according
to
the
size
of
the
substrate
and
the
based
on
that
they
literally
change
their
active
site
design
a
bit.
So,
that
it
will
or
it
will
particularly
preferably
like
you
know
fix
into
the
into
this
into
the
their
active
site
properly
and
this
is
how
the
product
is
developed.
So,
in
case
of
lock
and
key
mechanism
as
I
was
discussing
that
it
is
proposed
by
the
German
chemist
Emil
Fisher
in
1894.
So,
it
normally
it
elucidates
that
the
elucidates
that
the
interaction
between
the
substrate
used
in
the
enzymatic
reaction
and
enzyme
in
terms
of
the
lock
and
key
analogy
ok.
In
this
according
to
this
theory
both
the
enzyme
and
the
substrate
havecomplementary
geometric
shapes
and
orientations
which
each
other
in
which
they
feed
easily
just
as
a
key
feeds
into
the
lock.
So,
here
the
enzyme
the
active
sites
present
in
the
enzyme
represents
as
a
lock
and
have
the
ability
to
accept
the
specific
substrate
and
this
is
exemplified
as
a
keys
ok.
The
shape
of
both
the
enzyme
and
substrate
do
not
normally
affect
each
other
and
thus
the
substrate
remains
stabilized
for
long.
Then
there
come
the
induced
feed
model.
In
case
of
induced
feed
model
the
scientist
Koshland
he
like
in
1963
postulated
that
an
induced
feed
model
can
overcome
the
drawback
of
lock
and
key
model
because
of
the
flexibility
of
the
catalytic
site
in
of
an
enzyme.
Because
in
some
cases
Fisher
template
model
it
fails
to
you
know
kind
of
give
any
particular
search
any
particular
you
know
ideal
idea
to
this
concept
that
when
in
case
the
active
site
of
the
enzyme
is
not
fitting
to
the
substrate
what
happens
in
that
case.
So,
how
still
they
can
consume
it
and
how
they
still
they
can
perform
their
operations.
That
particular
drawbacks
can
be
easily
like
you
know
easily
showcased
by
this
induced
feed
model
where
they
have
seen
they
have
it
is
mentioned
that
the
substrate
induced
the
conformational
changes
in
its
catalytic
site
of
the
enzyme.
So,
that
the
substrate
can
perfectly
fit
on
its
active
site
in
a
convenient
manner
and
it
catalyzes
the
chemical
reaction
successfully ,
understood.
So,
this
model
also
proposes
the
competitive
inhibitions
allosteric
variations
and
the
denaturation
of
the
enzymes
during
the
inactivation
as
well.
What
type
of
enzyme
we
should
actually
select
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater?
There
are
majorly
6
functional
classes
of
enzymes
based
on
their
catalytic
reactions
hydrolysis,
the
oxido
reductase,
isomerases
like
transferase,
lyases
and
the
ligases.
So,
out
of
all
these
things
the
hydro
hydrolysis
and
the
oxido
reductases
are
the
widely
used
enzyme
in
the
wastewater
treatment
scenario
or
the
in
this
particular
subjects
due
to
their
wide
range
of
biocatalytic
properties
with
most
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater
ok.
Other
than
the
lacase
and
the
peroxidases
are
also
common
mostly
employed
for
eliminating
the
organic
micro
contaminant
from
the
wastewater
due
to
their
wide
ranging
substrate
specific
as
a
specificities
and
all
ok.
So,
however ,
you
just
try
to
remember
this
oxido
reductases
and
hydrolysis
are
one
of
the
most
commonly
used
enzymes
in
wastewater
treatments
in
a
in
this
particular
subject.
Now ,
selection
of
enzyme.
When
we
treat
the
wastewater
what
do
we
mean
by
the
treating?
Treating
means
we
have
to
somehow
get
rid
of
the
pollutant
load
from
the
system.
So,
when
we
try
to
get
rid
of
the
pollutant
load
from
the
systems
by
using
a
specific
treatment
procedure.
So,
whenever
we
use
the
enzyme
we
have
to
make
sure
that
thatenzyme
is
target
specific
that
the
pollutant
that
is
present
in
your
wastewater
is
actually
specific
to
that
kind
of
pollutant
only
you
introduce
the
enzyme
which
can
target
on
that
pollutant.
Normally
there
are
different
type
of
pollutants
like
we
can
say
like
carbohydrate
same
as
like
you
know
the
nutrient
available
in
the
in
our
food
it
is
majorly
like
that
only
we
have
carbohydrate
fat
a
protein
based
pollutants
and
all
right.
So,
and
sometimes
heavy
metals
sometimes
the
temperature
base
any
other
and
so
on
so
forth
we
already
discussed
about
these
things.
So,
for
degrading
the
animal
fat
oil
and
grease
we
can
target
the
enzyme
called
the
lipase.
For
targeting
the
protease
protein
component
we
can
we
can
incorporate
the
enzymes
called
the
protease.
For
tackling
the
phosphate
organophosphates
chlorinated
compounds
and
other
organic
compounds
we
can
target
the
carboxyl
esterases
and
all.
Like
this
organophosphates
compounds
can
also
hydrolyzed
via
the
phosphotry
esterases
enzymes
as
well
ok.
And
the
carbon
and
halogen
bonds
of
halogenated
aliphatic
compounds
can
cleave
by
haloalkine
di
halogens
and
all.
So,
based
on
the
type
of
the
pollutant
we
can
modulate
we
can
actually
choose
the
type
of
enzyme
that
we
need
to
provide
into
the
systems.
Like
for
the
horst
so
this
is
the
this
is
from
some
different
literatures
which
is
not
I
mean
like
not
very
specific,
but
you
can
definitely
get
some
idea
about
the
requirement
of
a
specific
enzyme
for
specific
type
of
pollutants
ok.
Like
different
kind
of
lacase
collected
from
the
this
choriolopsis
gallica
has
a
higher
and
the
speedier
oxidation
rate
compared
to
other
fungus
lacases.
Different
types
of
lipase
enzyme
hydrolysis
hydrolyze
the
animal
fat
vegetable
oil
and
floating
grease
present
in
the
food
waste.
Three
types
of
lipases
are
there
lipase
1,
2,
3
from
the
asper gillus
species,
candida
species
or
portion
species
degrade
the
animal
fat
vegetable
oil
and
the
floating
greases
respectively
and
respectively
and
all.
So,
this
is
like
very
specific
to
this
kind
to
this
to
the
pollutant.
So,
that
is
why
we
have
to
select
the
enzyme
based
on
the
type
of
pollutant
that
we
are
targeting.
In
general
what
is
the
role
of
microbial
enzyme
for
wastewater
treatment?
The
mixture
of
this
carbohydrates
and
the
protease
and
the
lipase
enzymes
it
can
remove
up
to
90
percent
of
the
COD
and
the
90
percent
of
the
BOD
from
the
BRIORI
wastewater
according
to
the
study
given
study
done
by
the
Eisen
et
al
in
2009.
So,
you
can
easily
understand
that
just
by
providing
this
biological
I
mean
like
this
compounds
like
you
know
this
enzymes
this
carbohydrates
and
protease
and
lipase
they
effectively
remove
this
90
percent
of
COD.
That
means,
if
suppose
you
have
a
suppose
you
have
a
1000
milligram
per
liter
of
COD
load
in
your
system.
So,
it
can
remove
up
to
900
milligram
per
liter
from
the
systems.So,
which
is
a
huge
and
this
much
of
removal
if
it
can
take
place
in
any
enzymatic
biological
treatment
processes
it
drastically
actually
I
would
say
like
outperform
all
the
existing
wastewater
treatment
systems
like
you
know
which
does
not
actually
employ
the
enzymatic
treatment
processes
and
all.
Because
most
of
the
aerobic
treatment
processes
or
the
aerobic
treatment
processes
it
somehow
stuck
up
to
80-85
percentage
of
COD
removal
and
all.
However ,
in
case
of
enzymatic
year
because
we
are
normally
providing
this
kind
of
enzymes
with
a
targeted
pollutant.
So,
our
efficiency
is
much
higher
the
chances
of
getting
much
higher
removal
efficiency
is
more
prominent
in
this
kind
of
reactors.
So,
that
is
why
this
enzymatic
specific
enzyme
based
biological
treatment
systems
are
actually
work
much
nice
much
better
way
than
the
existing
treatment
systems
which
only
randomly
when
we
put
the
aerobic
or
anaerobic
treatment
systems
you
understand.
So,
this
is
the
reason
why
the
role
of
microbial
enzyme
come
into
the
picture.
There
are
other
studies
with
the
enzymatic
treatment
duration
of
96
hour
the
combined
enzymes
reduces
50
percent
and
100
percent
is
of
total
suspended
solid
and
total
hydrocarbon
respectively
it
is
quite
huge.
The
two
major
nutrients
such
as
the
ammonium
nitrogen
and
the
phosphate
also
eliminated
with
the
removal
efficiency
of
100
percentage
and
91.6
percentage
respectively
from
brewery
wastewater .
That
means,
those
enzymes
are
capable
of
removing
100
percent
ammonium
nitrogen
from
the
system
ok,
which
is
one
of
the
best
I
mean
like
I
would
say
like
you
know
the
system
that
is
possible
and
you
need
we
can
employ
this
kind
of
system
this
kind
of
it
needs
some
certain
expertise
certain
you
know
the
experience
I
would
also
say
to
be
the
to
work
on
this
kind
of
systems,
but
however ,
once
it
is
developed
and
it
is
started
running
properly
your
treatment
since
treatment
plant
can
achieve
maximum
treatment
efficiency .
Maximum
COD
removal
efficiency
of
54.3
percent
is
achieved
with
the
pH
of
4.8
from
distill
wastewater
after
72
hour
in
the
aerobic
oxidation.
So,
you
can
see
the
difference
ok.
So,
this
is
to
just
to
give
you
one
example
this
is
not
actually
true
all
the
cases
like
it
is
not
that
low
COD
removal
in
some
cases
the
aerobic
oxidation
can
go
as
high
as
80
percent
85
percent
is
removal
of
COD
as
well
ok.
However ,
the
comparatively
the
enzymatic
reactions
are
much
more
efficient.
The
protease,
amylase
and
the
lipase
enzyme
extracted
from
the
organic
kitchen
waste
is
effective
for
the
removal
of
93.5
percentage
total
suspended
solid,
90.8
percentage
total
dissolved
solid,
94.3
percentage
of
total
oil
and
grease,
75
percentage
of
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand,
97.4
percentage
of
the
chemical
oxygen
demand
and
99.3
percentage
of
the
chloride
from
the
domestic
wastewater
as
per
the
research
done
by
Joseph
et
al
2020.If
you
want
to
read
this
paper
the
reference
in
the
reference
section
it
is
given
the
paper
details
you
just
go
through
it
and
try
to
understand
the
functionality
how
this
kind
of
enzymes
are
nowadays
employed
in
the
wastewater
treatment
system
the
advanced
design
of
wastewater
treatment
systems
and
it
is
it
performed
much
better
than
the
existing
ones
and
can
be
the
future
of
wastewater
treatment
system
design
I
would
say.
Forget
about
future
even
nowadays
also
lot
of
people
started
employing
in
the
real
life
real
field
scenarios
and
all.
In
general,
the
if
you
see
the
role
of
microbial
enzyme
the
detoxification
treatment
of
toxic
organic
and
inorganic
pollutant
using
different
type
of
microbial
enzymes
are
eco
friendly
and
sustainable
approach
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater .
Second
is
the
micro
enzymes
it
extract
the
energy
from
the
organic
matter
present
in
the
wastewater
through
this
energy
yielding
biological
reactions
which
facilitated
by
the
enzymes
when
pollutants
are
oxidized
by
the
microbiota.
Biological
treatment
through
this
microbial
enzyme
is
definitely
advantageous
due
to
its
action
due
to
the
action
of
enzyme
on
pollutants
even
when
they
are
present
in
a
very
dilute
solution.
This
is
a
very
important
thing
because
sometimes
what
happened
of
some
type
of
genobiotic
compound
it
stays
in
the
wastewater
treatment
systems
in
a
very
low
concentration.
Suppose
the
pharmaceutical
product
there
are
type
different
type
of
pharmaceutical
pollutant
which
stays
in
the
wastewater
in
the
hospital
wastewater
and
all
in
a
very
minute
amount
ok.
So,
in
this
because
of
this
minute
amount
in
say
like
in
nanogram
per
liter
level.
So,
once
it
is
in
nanogram
per
liter
level
so,
what
happens
it
is
very
hard
for
any
specific
type
of
treatment
to
work
on
it
on
any
generic
treatment
to
work
on
this
kind
of
pollutant
which
is
in
a
very
minor
amount.
However ,
it
is
still
detrimental
it
can
be
carcinogenic
it
can
be
very
dangerous
for
human
consumption
or
any
other
activities.
So,
still
the
those
pollutants
should
be
removed.
However ,
it
is
hard
to
remove
hard
to
be
removed
from
the
existing
systems.
So,
that
is
why
we
we
introduce
this
kind
of
enzymatic
reactions
enzymatic
treatment
systems
because
enzyme
can
work
on
it
particularly
targeting
that
particular
type
of
enzyme
particular
type
of
pollutant
and
remove
it
from
the
system.
And
this
is
where
the
this
kind
of
enzymatic
microbial
enzymatic
biological
treatment
systems
come
into
the
picture
more
and
more
with
time
to
come.
Then
oxidoreductase
enzymes
which
can
contribute
to
the
hemification
of
different
phenolic
compounds
that
are
produced
from
the
decomposition
of
lignin
in
soil
or
aqueous
environment.
Oxidereductase
also
can
remove
different
toxic
genobiotic
compounds
as
I
just
mentioned
like
phenolic
or
aniline
compounds
present
in
the
wastewater
via
polymerization
of
or
the
copolymerization
with
the
hemix
substances.
These
oxidoreductases
are
actually
quite
commonly
used
very
I
mean
say
famous
in
wastewater
treatment
systems
they
people
use
it
a
lot
and
in
there
are
different
studiesdone
in
the
microbial
fuel
cell
like
studies
also.
In
the
microbial
fuel
cell
means
it
is
where
we
use
some
fuel
cell
technology
where
we
have
the
anodic
and
the
cathodic
compartment
and
all.
In
this
anodic
compartment
we
use
a
specific
type
of
enzyme
and
it
reacts
it
actually
acts
on
the
type
of
pollutant
we
are
actually
supplying
in
a
targeted
manner .
And
because
of
that
it
not
only
reduces
the
pollutant
load,
but
also
it
generates
the
electricity
out
of
it
ok.
In
coming
lecture
in
the
end
of
this
lecture
series
I
will
be
discussing
about
those
systems
as
well
this
advanced
water
treatment
system
that
is
coming
into
the
picture.
Nowadays
all
over
world
people
are
working
on
it
that
needs
to
be
discussed
you
need
to
understand
those
advancement
in
the
water
treatment
technologies
as
well
wastewater
treatment
technologies
as
well.
There
are
species
like
you
know
candida
tropicalis
or
the
dibyromasis
polymorphos
and
this
filamentous
fungi
like
penicillium
gastivorus
and
also
ambelopsis
isabellina
yeast
which
decolorize
the
100
million
per
liter
of
synthetic
dye
using
the
manganese
dependent
oxalo
reductase
enzyme
within
16
to
48
hours.
This
removal
of
dye
is
a
major
problem
in
various
industries
and
all
like
whether
it
be
paint
industry ,
whether
it
be
other
industries
and
all
like
you
know
where
they
uses
some
synthetic
dye
and
all
like
in
the
textile
industries
and
all.
So,
in
order
to
get
rid
of
this
additional
synthetic
dye
which
is
very
hard
to
degrade
and
also
which
is
very
dangerous
for
the
human
consumptions
and
has
a
very
strict
law
by
most
of
the
governmental
body
all
over
the
world
and
it
needs
to
be
removed
before
it
reaches
to
the
surface
water
bodies.
So,
this
can
be
done
by
oxalo
reductase
enzyme
as
I
was
discussing.
So,
and
specific
and
you
can
see
the
removal
it
can
be
removed
completely
within
16
to
48
hour
by
different
studies.
It
also
could
remove
the
chlorinated
phenolic
compound
found
in
the
effluent
of
the
paper
and
pulp
industries.
This
white
row
fungi
releases
the
various
extracellular
oxalo
reductase
enzymes
from
their
mycelium
into
the
environment
that
assist
to
the
degrade
the
industrial
wastewater
content
in
different
genobiotic
and
phenolic
compounds.
Lacases
can
catalyze
the
oxidation
reduction
reaction
of
phenolic
compounds
and
methoxy
phenolic
acids
with
simultaneous
reduction
of
the
subatomic
oxygen
to
water .
So,
this
you
just
try
just
these
are
the
examples
of
how
beneficiary
how
how
the
wastewater
treatment
system
the
treatment
plant
designers
and
the
researcher
actually
benefited
by
introducing
the
enzyme
to
the
system
the
to
the
unit.
Different
microbiota
produces
intra
and
extracellular
a
lackages
which
can
catalyze
the
oxidation
of
different
phenolic
compounds.
The
three
different
types
of
fungal
a
lackages
collected
from
a
trimetes
species,
pycnoporous
species
and
the
plurota
species,
de-lignifies
the
high
quality
paperpulp
and
almost
90
percent
of
the
lignin
was
removed
after
the
lacase
mediator
treatment
via
H
2
O
2
bleaching.
So,
this
is
done
in
IIT,
KGB
itself.
So,
IIT
Kharagpur
itself
this
research
and
it
is
actually
the
it
showcases
the
advancement
of
the
treatment
system,
advancement
of
the
wastewater
treatment
system
using
a
different
type
of
enzymes
and
all.
We
can
further
enhance
the
treatment
capacity
of
efficiency
of
wastewater
treatment
systems
by
this
immobilized
enzymes
like
for
recyclability
require
the
low
maintenance,
easy
metal
and
nutrient
recovery
for
ecological
and
the
cost
effective
approach.
How
heavy
metal
and
mercury
is
recovered?
See
immobilized
papain
enzyme
on
sodium
alginate
matrix
can
remove
the
mercury
too
and
removal
efficiency
can
be
as
high
as
98.
88
percent
within
8
minutes.
Immobilized
U.S.
remove
the
heavy
metal
ions
such
as
mercury ,
copper ,
silver ,
zinc,
cadmium
from
the
wastewater .
Genetically
engineered
microor ganism
like
the
genomic
component
through
the
recombinant
deoxyribonucleic
acid
technology
it
create
the
strain
for
the
treatment
of
wastewater
that
can
survive
in
extreme
environmental
conditions.
So,
now,
we
are
not
only
introducing
those
enzymes,
but
we
also
genetically
engineered
them
so
to
make
it
more
effective
for
treating
the
wastewater
targeted
wastewater
and
all.
So,
we
use
some
recombinant
DNA
technologies
and
also
that
it
target
that
particular
type
of
waste,
a
particular
type
of
pollutant
in
our
wastewater
treatment
system
and
we
can
remove
those
pollutant
from
the
systems
in
a
much
efficient
and
highly
effective
way.
There
are
transgenic
plants
development
like
genes
from
the
animals,
microbites
and
other
plants
degrade
different
genobiotic
compounds.
This
cytochrome
P450
genes
enhances
the
metabolism
of
the
genobiotic
compound
like
herbicides
and
the
volatile
halogenated
hydrocarbons
from
the
contaminated
waste
groundwater .
There
are
studies
where
genetically
modified
microbes
can
also
be
utilized
as
a
microbial
biosensors
for
the
rapid
and
precise
detection
of
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater .
So,
how
it
works?
This
microbial
biosensors
it
is
nothing,
but
how
it
reacts
I
mean
like
suppose
it
is
once
you
final
once
you
have
a
particular
type
of
load
pollutant
load
say
your
BOD
is
100
milligram
per
liter
in
your
wastewater .
So,
once
you
introduce
a
particular
type
of
enzyme
after
say
2
hour
you
check
you
identify
that
the
final
wastewater
or
final
wastewater
like
you
know
it
comes
down
to
say
50.
So,
50
percent
removal
is
possible
within
2
hour
then
in
5
hour
it
is
a
say
100
percent
removal
is
possible.
So,
this
way
you
make
the
calibration
curve
and
all
and
then
at
different
COD
you
try
to
check
the
what
is
the
change
that
it
happens
when
the
when
it
is
instead
of
100
milligram
per
liter
when
we
introduce
200
milligram
per
liter
how
the
changes
arehappening
place
changes
are
taking
place
in
with
timely
manner .
Based
on
that
we
go
we
prepare
a
calibration
curve
and
from
there
when
we
introduce
that
system
to
a
unknown
pollutant
load
sample
that
from
unknown
pollutant
load
also
you
can
easily
from
the
from
the
removal
curve
that
you
will
get
after
within
a
couple
of
hour
you
will
be
able
to
tell
that
what
was
the
in
what
was
the
actual
pollutant
load
of
the
system.
So,
this
is
just
to
give
you
one
example
how
it
can
work
ok.
This
microbial
biosensors
are
so,
they
will
assist
you
to
understanding
the
pollutant
load
they
can
assist
you
to
understand
the
actual
target
pollutant
load
from
your
wastewater
and
all.
So,
what
is
the
potential
of
algae
in
the
wastewater
systems?
So,
we
already
discussed
about
the
enzymes.
So,
now,
let
us
discuss
about
the
algae
how
why
how
algae
is
more
important
and
how
it
is
performing
and
its
revolutionizing
the
wastewater
treatment
system
as
we
can
see
today .
So,
it
can
remove
the
pollutants,
nutrients
and
the
toxic
metals
and
the
pathogens
from
the
wastewater .
The
photosynthetic
algae
has
been
used
for
tertiary
wastewater
treatment
due
to
its
easy
adaptable
nature
in
the
aquatic
environment
along
with
the
high
biomass
productivity
compared
to
other
photosynthetic
microor ganisms.
And
also
algal
biomass
after
the
treatment
is
done
it
is
harvested
from
the
wastewater
and
can
be
used
for
the
feedstock
for
the
biofuel
production
and
all.
So,
that
is
also
something
of
additional
economic
benefit.
And
the
primary
and
secondary
treatment
in
normally
required
to
reduce
the
concentration
of
organic
matter
and
other
pollutant
concentration
if
present
in
the
wastewater .
But
further
this
kind
of
algae
based
tertiary
treatment
it
is
symbiotic
to
algae
and
bacterial
amyloids,
the
amyloids
the
treatment
efficiency
as
microalgae
remove
the
impurities
via
their
cellular
metabolism.
So,
our
target
is
to
increase
the
efficiency
and
algae
can
work
as
a
very
nice
polishing
treatment
technology
for
removing
further
impurities
from
the
wastewater .
In
general
this
algae
assisted
tertiary
treatments
it
provide
an
economic
approach
by
reducing
the
energy
consumption
and
carbon
footprint
of
the
conventional
wastewater
treatment
processes.
It
also
eliminate
has
a
capacity
to
eliminate
almost
90
percent
of
the
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
present
in
the
wastewater .
There
are
hundreds
of
study
available
in
the
in
the
in
the
Google
in
the
you
can
easily
search
for
it
where
they
have
found
that
this
efficiency
can
be
further
increased
with
time
with
the
with
the
more
efficient
design
of
algal
bioreactor
coming
into
the
picture
right
now.
Harvested
algal
biomass
can
be
transformed
into
valuable
carbon
neutral
biofuels
such
as
bioethanol,
biodiesel,
other
other
valuable
byproduct
like
biogas,
bio
fertilizer ,
cosmetics,
medicines
and
animal
feed
or
the
cattle
feed
etcetera.
There
are
like
the
hundreds
of
application
of
this
harvested
algal
biomass
once
it
is
utilized
in
the
once
it
is
utilized
for
consuming
the
wastewater
from
the
consuming
the
pollutant
from
thewastewater .
This
microalgae
assisted
wastewater
normally
it
provides
newer
revenues
to
the
biological
treatment
system
which
possess
a
significant
advantages
over
the
conventional
ones.
So,
also
it
normally
utilize
the
solar
light
and
atmospheric
carbon
dioxide
as
energy
and
carbon
source
and
also
it
can
be
classified
as
eukaryotic
or
prokaryotic
cyanobacteria
based
on
its
utilization
of
energy
and
the
carbon
source.
Different
type
of
unicellular
green
microalgae
species
like
chlorella
and
the
cenodesmus
species
and
all
they
are
widely
used
in
the
wastewater
treatment
system.
Diverse
group
of
algal
species
like
the
chlorophyc
like
you
know
chlorophyc
like
you
know
green
algae,
the
cyanophyc
like
you
know
the
blue
green
algae
or
the
chrysophyc
like
you
know
golden
algae
and
the
baserophyc
like
the
diatoms
are
found
in
different
wastewater
treatment
systems.
This
diatom
I
am
telling
you
just
go
through
it
and
try
to
understand
some
more
details
read
a
little
bit
more
about
this
diatom.
Diatom
is
will
be
the
future
of
wastewater
treatment
systems
has
a
capacity
to
be
the
future
of
wastewater
treatment
systems
for
its
huge
benefit
the
way
it
in
the
increases
its
biomass
it
is
a
huge
reproduction
rate
and
it
is
the
way
it
consumes
the
amount
of
the
consumes
the
amount
of
pollutant
from
the
wastewater
it
is
enormous
and
there
are
hundreds
of
literature
there
are
like
lot
of
people
all
over
the
world
now
focusing
on
diatom
application
in
the
wastewater
treatment
systems.
Algal
groups
which
are
classified
based
upon
the
different
types
of
intra
and
extracellular
structure
lifespan
and
the
pigmentation
and
the
storage
yields.
So,
in
general
how
we
where
we
apply
the
algae
in
the
wastewater
treatment
systems?
First
to
remove
the
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
this
kind
of
inorganic
substances
which
still
stays
in
the
system
even
after
employing
couple
of
treatment
units.
So,
primary
and
secondary
treatment
units.
So,
we
can
remove
those
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
using
the
microalgae.
It
can
be
we
can
be
used
for
removal
of
chemical
and
the
biochemical
oxygen
demons
COD,
BOD
removal
as
you
have
there
are
literature
where
they
found
out
that
mixed
concentration
of
this
filamentous
cyanobacteria
can
remove
98.2
and
84
percent
of
the
COD
and
the
total
organic
carbon
respectively
from
the
domestic
wastewater
treatment
system.
Reduction
of
polyform
and
the
other
pathogen
microalgae
can
also
remove
the
99
percent
of
the
total
polyform
successfully
from
the
municipal
wastewater
via
high
rate
algal
photobioreactor
with
22
gram
per
meter
square
of
meter
square
per
day
meter
square
per
day
of
biomass
production.
So,
it
is
not
only
helping
get
rid
of
the
pollutant
from
the
wastewater ,
but
also
it
produces
some
biomass
that
can
be
utilized
for
further
byproduct
recovery .
Other
than
that
it
also
can
remove
the
heavy
metal
by
the
process
of
biosurptions.
There
are
there
are
different
kind
of
literatures
which
showcases
that
it
canremove
100
percent
of
the
heavy
metal
from
the
systems
from
the
synthetic
wastewater
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
There
are
literatures
which
is
available
to
which
can
that
this
algae
can
remove
the
pesticide
and
other
genomic
compound
from
the
system
as
well.
As
you
can
see
from
this
example
this
study
where
this
Chlamydomonas
rain
hardity .
So,
they
effectively
degraded
100
percent
of
the
pesticide
trichloroform
or
TCF
commonly
known
as
a
TCF
from
the
synthetic
wastewater
with
a
maximum
concentration
of
100
milligram
per
liter
of
TCF
which
is
quite
huge,
but
still
that
algae
is
successful
in
removing
this
genomic
compounds
from
the
systems.
So,
if
you
can
see
this
five
example
that
is
given
it
is
the
one
of
the
major
nuisance
in
wastewater
treatment
system
which
still
can
present
even
after
the
primary
and
the
secondary
treatment
is
done.
So,
you
can
easily
identify
easily
understand
how
effective
how
important
it
is
to
employ
the
system
employ
procedures
like
you
know
this
algae
in
the
wastewater
treatment
scenarios
and
all
ok.
So,
in
general
we
come
to
the
conclusion
we
discussed
about
the
enzymes
which
comes
as
a
very
cost
effective
and
environment
environmental
friendly
solution
for
wastewater
treatment
and
its
crucial
role
in
a
diverse
and
because
of
its
diverse
catalytic
properties
it
can
act
as
a
crucial
it
can
play
a
crucial
role
in
wastewater
treatment
scenario.
The
use
majorly
in
the
wastewater
treatment
scenario
it
proves
to
be
much
more
advantageous
for
removing
the
contaminants
in
the
wastewater
with
a
focus
on
BOD
and
COD
removal.
Whereas
the
algae
are
found
to
be
the
one
of
the
play
can
play
a
major
role
in
removing
different
pollutants
nutrient
and
the
pathogens
and
very
emer ging
contaminants
that
is
that
is
coming
into
the
picture
day
to
day
basis
then
this
algae
can
act
a
very
good
role
in
removing
all
this
pollutants
and
all.
These
are
the
different
references
I
would
like
you
to
go
through
it
and
actually
read
those
paper
it
will
give
you
a
very
good
understanding
about
the
discussions
that
we
had
today
ok.
So,
thank
you
so
much
I
hope
you
understand
the
role
of
enzyme
and
the
algae
in
details
in
the
and
the
how
they
can
play
a
very
futuristic
role
in
the
in
the
wastewater
treatment
scenario
and
the
research
is
still
going
on
to
be
to
make
it
more
effective
in
future
ok.
Thank
you
so
much
I
hope
you
got
to
know
some
very
good
understanding
about
the
algae
and
the
application
of
enzymes
in
wastewater
treatment
systems
we
will
see
you
in
the
next
video.
Thank
you.
