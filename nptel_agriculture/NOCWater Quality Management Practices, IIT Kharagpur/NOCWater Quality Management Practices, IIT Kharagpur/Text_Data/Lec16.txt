–
Screens
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharbomi.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology
Kharagpur .
So,
in
this
fourth
module
we
will
be
starting
on
the
discussion
about
the
Physico-Chemical
Operations
and
Processes
and
we
will
be
starting
with
the
discussion
about
the
screen
and
we
will
also
be
discussing
about
the
how
we
can
design
the
screens.
So,
this
fourth
module
and
fifth
module
will
mainly
be
focusing
on
the
primary
treatment
units,
then
we
will
in
the
consecutive
modules
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
secondary
tertiary
and
some
case
studies
as
well.
So,
if
you
see
the
concepts
that
we
will
be
covering
in
this
particular
lecture
video
are
the
screens
as
a
unit
as
an
unit
operation.
You
requirements
in
the
specification
for
bar
screen
that
what
are
the
types
of
screen,
the
quantities
of
screening,
screen
chamber
design
and
the
disposal
of
disposal
of
those
screenings.
And
this
disposable
screenings
means
nothing,
but
the
screened
particles
the
filtered
particles
will
actually
need
to
dispose
in
the
scientific
way.
So,
that
is
called
the
disposable
of
screening.
If
you
see
the
screen
if
you
remember
when
at
the
very
beginning
when
we
were
I
was
discussing
we
were
discussing
about
the
different
type
of
primary
treatment
units.
Screen
is
one
of
the
major
and
one
of
the
very
important
one
that
we
need
to
be
at
least
employed
during
the
municipal
wastewater
treatment.
Even
in
some
kind
of
industrial
wastewater
treatment
also
we
normally
in
use
or
introduce
the
screen
at
the
very
first
stage
of
treatment
in
a
treatment
plant.
So,
if
you
see
this
particular
picture
if
you
see
in
the
left
side
when
it
is
like
in
the
in
the
I
mean
like
the
if
you
see
in
the
picture
which
is
in
the
upper
side
upper
picture
it
is
written
the
bar
it
is
dense
that
is
the
bar
screen.
And
after
the
bar
screen
you
see
the
draw
this
draw
is
nothing,
but
if
you
use
the
rack
or
some
by
say
like
if
it
is
like
in
a
not
the
mechanized
one
it
is
like
you
know
the
human
drag
one.
So,
we
can
use
it
we
can
clean
it
by
using
a
rack
and
we
can
just
put
those
the
screenings
or
the
those
screen
particles
and
all
we
can
put
it
in
the
draw .
And
whatever
the
water
level
if
you
can
see
in
the
just
before
the
screen
the
water
level
is
quite
higher
than
the
after
the
screen
right
because
there
is
a
change
of
head.
There
is
a
change
of
head
or
because
of
the
change
of
head
is
like
you
know
what
is
the
reason
behind
it
if
I
ask
you
what
is
the
reason
why
there
is
a
change
of
head
in
the
it
happens
during
the
screen.
Because
of
the
obstruction
the
restriction
that
the
screen
is
providing
and
because
of
the
there
is
a
chance
there
is
some
amount
of
foreign
particles
can
getclogged
on
to
the
into
this
bar
screens
it
can
actually
influence
to
the
screen
clogging
and
it
will
eventually
increase
obviously ,
influence
to
the
head
losses.
In
order
to
counter
the
head
loss
what
we
need
to
do
we
need
to
provide
some
additional
head
in
the
downside
of
the
screen.
If
you
see
just
in
the
upstream
side
in
the
downstream
side
there
is
a
direct
drop
this
drop
is
nothing,
but
this
drop
is
actually
purposefully
provided
in
order
to
nullify
the
head
loss
that
may
cause
because
of
the
introduction
of
the
screen
you
understand.
So,
we
will
discuss
about
it
we
will
be
doing
it
in
a
numerically
we
will
prove
that
why
this
head
loss
is
important
will
be
numerically
prove
it
in
this
lecture
video
only
at
the
later
slide.
So,
now,
I
just
want
you
to
be
having
a
over
overview
of
how
it
will
look
like
ok.
And
those
screens
if
you
see
the
plane
view
now
the
inlet
if
you
see
the
channel
is
quite
narrower
the
moment
it
enters
the
screen
the
cross
sectional
area
becomes
quite
higher .
That
is
one
thing
what
is
the
reason
behind
it
to
reduce
the
flow
to
reduce
the
there
is
a
chance
of
any
scouring
or
any
eddy
flow
current
that
can
generate
and
which
will
actually
kind
of
you
know
influence
the
screening
phenomena
that
is
happening
there.
Another
thing
if
you
see
from
the
plane
view
plane
view
if
you
see
it
has
this
bars
continuously
placed
like
you
know
parallelly
placed
bar
one
after
another
which
actually
helps
us
to
clean
the
wastewater
as
this
is
the
first
level
of
treatment
that
actually
wastewater
is
actually
introduced
I
mean
like
wastewater
is
facing
when
it
introduced
to
the
wastewater
treatment
plant.
So,
normally
it
used
to
remove
the
larger
size
of
particle
which
is
floating
or
suspended
in
nature.
And
we
normally
place
this
set
of
inclined
parallel
bars
fixed
at
a
certain
distance
apart
in
a
channel
and
the
screens
can
be
circular
or
rectangular
opening
in
nature.
And
if
you
if
you
realize
this
screens
these
are
like
parallel
rod
right
it
can
be
rod
it
can
be
bar
this
rod
that
it
can
be
of
any
metallic
rod
this
rod
can
be
rectangular
in
size
if
you
cut
the
if
you
cut
that
ah
rod
I
mean
like
the
cross
section
will
be
either
rectangular
or
circular
you
can
have
a
circular
rod
you
can
have
a
rectangular
shaped
rod.
So,
this
is
called
the
racks
this
ah
this
continuous
system
is
called
the
rack
and
this
screen
is
what
what
is
it
doing
what
is
the
basic
purpose
to
protect
the
palm,
valve,
pipe
plants
and
other
accessories
from
ah
damaging
or
clogging
by
racks
and
the
other
larger
size
particles.
And
also
it
also
helps
us
to
get
rid
of
those
particles
which
may
either
other
way
influence
or
may
create
a
quite
a
bit
of
a
nuisance
in
the
follow
up
treatment
unit.
So,
that
is
why
we
need
to
introduce
the
screens.
So,
as
I
was
discussing
this
cross
section
of
the
screen
chamber
is
always
greater
than
the
ah
incoming
sewer
almost
200
to
300
percent
if
you
can
see
in
the
ah
ah
bottom
right
picture
the
incoming
sewer
line
is
thinner ,
but
the
actual
ah
the
the
the
concentration
area
available
for
the
screen
chamber
is
quite
higher
almost
200
to
300
percent
is
higher .
Because
to
prevent
the
eddy
currentthat
can
generate
it
makes
this
because
of
this
eddy
current
it
can
actually
influence
the
flow
influence
the
operation
in
the
screen.
There
are
the
different
different
types
of
screen
depending
on
the
opening
size
it
can
be
coarse
screen
or
the
bar
screen
that
I
was
discussing
and
there
is
can
that
can
be
another
one
can
be
the
fine
screen.
Depending
on
the
cleaning
operations
we
can
have
manually
cleaned
one
or
the
mechanically
cleaned
one
manually
cleaned
one
we
just
simply
have
a
rack
like
structure
we
just
go
and
do
it
by
ourselves
that
is
also
possible
or
you
can
have
a
continuous
mechanical
cleaning
there
will
be
periodical
mechanical
rack
is
there
which
will
naturally
clean
it
after
a
certain
period
of
time.
The
coarse
screen
if
you
see
this
picture
they
that
is
how
like
it
looks
like
in
general
it
can
have
a
like
you
know
it
may
be
ah
coarse
woven
wire
screen
also
or
maybe
sometimes
we
the
communitors
we
I
will
show
you
what
is
communitors
what
it
is
like
and
how
it
looks
like
and
this
is
the
the
example
is
given
right
side
that
one
is
the
bar
screen.
In
general
this
bar
screen
are
provided
ahead
of
the
pump
or
grid
removal
facility
and
so,
to
and
it
can
be
manually
cleaned
or
the
mechanically
cleaned
and
the
size
the
average
I
mean
like
this
clear
spacing
in
between
two
rack
if
you
can
see
the
spacing
you
can
see
those
spacing
are
normally
in
the
range
of
15
millimeter
to
40
millimeter
ok.
So,
what
is
grinder
and
communitor
this
grinder
communitor
is
nothing,
but
it
is
used
normally
in
conjunction
with
coarse
screens
to
you
know
grind
or
cut
the
screenings.
Sometimes
those
screenings
can
be
of
you
know
higher
sized
and
which
can
actually
clog
the
screen
in
a
very
faster
rate.
So,
that
is
why
we
normally
introduce
this
communitor
communitor
or
grinders
which
will
actually
thread
like
you
know
having
this
shredding
tooth
and
all
which
will
actually
cut
those
additional
this
higher
sized
larger
particles
and
actually
make
it
easier
for
you
know
the
fine
screen
or
the
coarse
screen
associated
with
it
to
clean
it
properly .
So,
normally
the
thin
opening
in
this
like
you
know
which
are
having
the
size
I
mean
like
in
general
the
this
any
any
particle
which
is
having
0.6
to
1
centimeter
in
size
can
actually
be
shredded
by
normally
it
is
shredded
during
using
this
grinders
and
all.
What
is
this
fine
screen?
Fine
screens
you
can
you
can
easily
understand
coarse
screen
this
this
grinder
and
then
this
fine
screen.
Fine
screen
obviously ,
the
screen
size
will
be
screen
opening
will
be
much
lesser
in
the
normally
less
than
20
millimeter
less
than
6
millimeter
is
like
quite
typical
if
you
see
in
this
picture
this
is
the
this
is
how
the
coarse
like
fine
screen
looks
like.
So,
it
normally
can
be
fixed
or
static
wedge
wire
type
it
can
be
drum
type
it
can
be
step
wire
type
and
centrifugal
screen
is
also
possible.
Normally
fixed
or
the
static
screens
are
permanently
set
in
vertical
inclined
or
horizontal
position
and
it
must
be
clean
with
the
racks
or
like
teeth
or
like
brush
like
structure
withthe
you
know
metallic
teeth
in
it
or
metallic
nails
in
it.
Moveable
screens
are
normally
cleaned
continuously
using
operation
using
an
additional
rack
or
the
baffle
like
structure
and
co
centrifugal
screens
are
there
which
normally
utilize
the
rotating
screen
and
separated
out
the
effluent
and
the
solid
particles
you
know .
Then
there
are
different
types
of
medium
and
fine
screen
based
on
the
the
the
way
it
is
inclined
like
you
know
ah
the
one
which
we
call
the
inclined
or
the
fixed
one
in
it
can
be
ah
flat
ah
type
it
can
be
disc
type
or
it
can
be
cage
type
normally
it
is
inclined
at
a
certain
angle.
So,
this
ah
normally
have
a
like
opening
of
0.25
to
2.5
millimeter
and
they
are
used
for
primary
treatment
of
industrial
effluent
in
in
general.
There
are
type
of
ah
screen
which
we
call
band
what
happen
it
nothing
it
it
has
this
endless
perforated
bands
ah
that
passes
over
ah
you
know
upper
and
the
lower
sprockets
and
there
is
a
sprockets
and
the
brushes
are
installed
to
remove
the
material.
So,
it
is
keep
on
keep
on
rotating
and
the
brushes
are
keep
on
removing
the
materials
which
is
retained
by
this
kind
of
screens.
There
are
drum
screens
and
strainers
in
the
drum
screen
in
all
the
other
screen
that
we
have
discussed
till
now
normally
water
passes
directly
through
it,
but
in
this
kind
of
drum
screen
it
this
water
like
you
know
flows
radially .
So,
this
is
like
the
drum
and
water
is
flowing
through
radially
towards
the
ah
like
you
know
like
you
know
towards
the
radial
direction
and
because
of
then
this
rotating
cylinder
it
has
some
ah
circumfacial
area
which
actually
has
nothing,
but
the
screens.
So,
from
the
screen
you
can
see
the
water
will
try
water
will
try
to
pass
through
the
radially
and
water
will
obviously ,
seep
through
the
screen
and
it
will
be
attached
to
a
certain
row
or
like
in
the
which
will
which
is
there
in
the
bottom
and
all
the
coarse
particle
will
be
screen
on
the
surface
I
mean
like
all
the
coarse
particle
will
be
filtered
on
this
rotating
drums
ok.
So,
these
are
very
much
easier
and
sometimes
it
is
easy
to
clean
also
this
kind
of
drum
screens
and
the
strainers
which
we
call.
If
you
see
this
ah
chamber
there
are
normally
we
try
to
have
at
least
2
unit
of
screen
at
a
time
in
case
one
get
gets
clogged.
So,
we
can
have
one
additional
or
one
spare
ah
screen
to
use.
So,
this
arrangements
can
be
done
in
different
ways
you
can
have
it
in
the
one
that
you
can
see
in
the
very
top
you
can
have
the
racks
you
can
see
the
stop
gate
ah
arrangements.
So,
you
can
just
open
one
of
the
stop
gate
and
you
can
let
it
pass
through
one
side
and
then
once
that
is
choked
you
just
completely
close
that
gate
and
use
the
open
the
other
gate
ok.
So,
the
water
will
flow
from
the
other
side
now
you
can
that
you
will
get
enough
time
to
clean
the
ah
I
mean
like
the
screen
on
that
side.
The
same
way
you
can
it
can
be
done
in
the
bottom
you
can
see
in
the
bottom
side
also
there
are
different
other
arrangements
that
can
be
made
ah
to
an
actually
clean
the
this
screen
I
mean
like
the
clean
the
screening
in
periodically
in
case
of
an
emer gency
in
case
it
gets
clogged.
So,
these
are
the
different
design
recommendations
that
I
am
having
like
if
in
case
in
future
like
you
know
you
will
be
ah
designing
any
ah
structure
any
treatment
plant
for
your
ahclient
you
have
to
make
sure
that
it
follows
there
are
either
of
these
4
designs.
In
general
it
should
follow
either
of
these
4
designs
and
you
have
to
have
one
backup
screen
ready
with
you
in
case
of
an
emer gency .
Normally
the
the
if
you
see
the
the
if
the
rectangular
channel
if
it
you
are
having
the
floor
of
the
screen
chamber
this
that
should
be
at
least
7
to
15
centimeter
lower
than
the
invert
of
the
incoming
sewer .
You
remember
in
the
very
beginning
I
I
told
you
why
this
ah
this
gap
is
there
why
there
is
this
additional
gap
to
you
know
somehow
nullify
the
head
gap
a
head
loss
that
can
occur
ah
because
of
the
introduction
of
the
screens.
The
bed
of
the
channel
it
may
be
flat
or
slopey
and
also
the
straight
approach
length
should
be
provided
to
uniform
distribution
of
the
screening
over
the
entire
screen
area
and
at
least
2
bar
racks
as
I
was
designing.
As
I
I
told
you
ah
to
each
design
for
the
to
carry
the
peak
flow
must
be
provided
and
arrangement
of
a
stopping
of
the
flow
and
the
draining
the
channel
should
be
made
for
routine
maintenance
and
also
the
entrance
structure
should
have
the
smooth
transition
and
the
diver gence
to
avoid
the
excessive
head
loss
and
the
deposition
of
solid.
Also
you
have
to
make
sure
that
the
effluent
structure
at
the
end
of
the
if
you
see
the
end
side
the
right
hand
side
the
effluent
side.
So,
there
also
the
structure
has
to
have
a
uniform
conver gence.
So,
the
effluent
in
the
from
the
individual
rack
may
be
combined
or
kept
separately
as
necessary
ok.
So,
when
we
will
be
designing
a
bar
screen
we
will
be
discussing
now
ah
very
important
part
of
this
ah
particular
I
mean
like
ah
the
lecture
video
is
like
the
when
we
start
the
designing
the
actual
design
part.
So,
I
would
like
you
to
be
ah
having
a
notebook
with
you
with
a
pen
and
or
pencil
whatever
you
have
to
please
note
down
some
very
important
informations
that
I
will
be
discussing
with
you
now
onwards.
Because
these
are
very
important
ah
numbers
or
these
are
very
important
ah
idea
that
you
need
to
be
implementing
when
you
will
actually
design
a
screen
ok.
So,
let
us
start
with
that.
So,
first
thing
is
the
velocity
of
flow.
The
lower
the
velocity
through
the
screen
the
greater
the
amount
of
screening
that
would
be
removed.
However ,
it
will
also
encourage
the
more
amount
of
clogging.
So,
we
have
to
null
we
have
to
somehow
optimize
the
flow.
How
we
can
optimize
the
flow?
There
are
certain
ways
of
doing
it.
So,
to
start
with
the
approach
velocity .
We
have
to
make
sure
that
the
bar
screen
should
not
have
ah
the
the
velocity
should
not
be
below
then
0.42
meter
per
second
that
is
done
by
some
standard
literatures
and
all.
So,
what
they
what
the
scientist
have
done
they
they
do
some
they
do
some
iterations
or
different
iterations
and
they
found
out
key
0.42
meter
per
second
offlow
is
quite
okish.
You
can
actually
if
you
are
maintaining
this
flow
it
is
ok
for
you
to
actually
ah
make
sure
that
your
rack
is
cleaned
periodically
I
mean
like
not
periodically
it
will
take
optimized
amount
of
time
for
you
to
clean
it
for
the
next
time.
I
mean
like
in
between
this
periodical
maintenance
time
has
to
be
as
elongate
like
you
know
as
long
as
possible
ok.
So,
in
general
if
there
are
the
wastewater
having
a
good
amount
of
grids
you
have
to
have
approach
velocity
at
least
0.6
to
0.75
meter
per
second
what
will
happen
otherwise
if
you
do
not
have
higher
flow
it
will
start
accumulating
on
the
ah
on
the
screen
itself.
Remember
the
grids
if
it
is
not
larger
sized
most
of
the
cases
the
by
definition
the
grids
can
easily
pass
through
the
screens
ok.
So,
this
grids,
but
if
you
wait
for
some
time
this
flow
is
small
flow
is
I
mean
like
the
slow
it
will
enter
it
will
interact
with
the
screen
and
it
will
start
a
depositing
on
this
on
that
is
a
level
itself
and
it
may
create
additional
amount
of
nuisance
for
us.
So,
our
target
is
to
accelerate
the
flow
a
little
bit
during
in
case
of
grid
bearing
waste
waters.
In
case
of
hand
cleaned
bar
screen
you
can
have
a
maximum
velocity
of
0.3
meter
per
second
at
average
flow.
So,
that
you
can
actually
control
in
in
this
case,
but
mechanically
clean
bar
screen
you
have
to
have
a
normal
maximum
flow
of
at
least
0.75
meter
per
second
in
case
because
it
is
not
in
your
hand
anymore
like
it
is
has
to
mechanically
done
you
have
to
make
sure
the
all
the
parameters
are
well
it
where
at
place.
The
velocity
of
0.6
to
1.2
meter
per
second
ah
through
the
screen
opening
for
the
peak
flow
normally
gives
the
ah
satisfactory
result.
Now ,
let
me
tell
you
one
ah
a
very
crucial
information
that
is
what
is
peak
flow
here
try
to
understand
there
are
various
definitions
of
it.
So,
in
general
if
you
see
ah
even
if
I
tell
you
in
a
diurnal
basis
in
a
say
like
in
ah
in
a
day
basis
in
one
day
what
happen?
Remember
last
lecture
also
we
discussed
that
the
flow
that
your
waste
water
treatment
plant
is
receiving
it
is
not
equal
all
the
time.
It
goes
up
and
down
based
on
the
time
of
the
day
that
we
are
talking
about
isn't
it.
And
also
if
during
the
during
the
monsoon
during
the
monsoon
season
if
your
drainage
if
your
sewer
line
is
actually
it
is
a
combined
sewer
what
will
happen
it
will
also
experience
the
storm
water
runof f.
So,
that
is
also
something
very
important
because
if
your
storm
water
runof f
is
actually
a
influencing
your
sewer
line
influencing
like
you
know
ah
introduced
to
the
sewer
line
it
will
also
go
to
go
and
put
a
put
a
additional
put
an
additional
pressure
in
your
treatment
plant.
So,
all
these
things
so,
this
peak
flow
normally
we
consider
that
on
an
average
flow
is
there
that
ah
you
can
have
the
hourly
average
you
can
have
the
daily
average
you
can
have
the
yearly
average.
And
what
is
peak
flow?
It
is
like
daily
peak
flow
there
is
what
is
the
maximum
peak
that
you
may
experience
based
on
the
historical
ah
evidences
that
flow
at
that
particular
time
what
is
the
maximum
waste
water
that
your
treatment
plant
can
actually
receive
based
on
the
historical
evidences
and
based
on
theah
anthropogenic
practices
that
is
happening
there.
So,
based
on
that
you
can
actually
get
it.
So,
this
peak
flow
normally
we
take
1.2
1.25
times
higher
than
the
average
flow
sometimes
it
may
be
2
times
higher
than
the
average
flow
also.
So,
either
this
values
will
be
given
to
you
or
either
this
values
has
to
be
you
have
to
justify
it
based
on
your
ah
based
on
the
the
values
the
historical
data
that
you
can
find
out
ah
from
your
target
ah
city
or
select
target
industry
or
select
target
ah
research
ok.
So,
this
is
very
important
for
you
to
understand
what
is
a
peak
flow
there
is
a
average
there
is
a
peak
flow
and
there
is
a
minimal
flow
like
maximum
flow
minimal
flow
ok.
So,
this
peak
is
very
important
ah
for
you
to
understand
like
at
least
the
gross
idea
you
should
at
least
have.
So,
that
you
can
actually
implemented
in
real
life
ah
scenarios.
So,
the
head
loss
as
I
was
saying
because
of
the
installation
of
the
rack
that
there
is
a
chances
of
the
head
loss.
And
this
head
loss
can
be
easily
calculated
using
the
Kirchner's
equations
this
h
equal
to
beta
w
by
v
to
the
power
4
by
3
h
v
into
sin
theta
whereas,
this
h
is
the
head
loss
in
meter
beta
is
the
bar
shape
factor
if
it
is
like
a
sharp
edge
at
rectangular
bar
rectangular
cross
section
bar
it
will
be
2.42
1.83
if
it
is
like
a
rectangular
bar,
but
upstream
side
it
is
semi-circular
ok.
ℎ=β(𝑊/𝑏)4/3ℎ𝑣𝑆𝑖𝑛θ                                                               
It
is
a
semi
circular ,
but
in
the
downstream
side
it
is
like
normal
ah
with
a
2
sharp
edges
you
understand.
And
1.79
if
it
is
a
circular
bar
I
mean
like
like
a
cylindrical
bar
you
understand.
And
1.67
for
rectangular
bar
bar
with
both
up
side
and
the
upstream
side
and
the
downstream
side
faces
as
semi-circular .
So,
it
is
not
necessary
it
is
complete
cylinder ,
but
it
is
a
like
a
rectangular
bar
it
goes
up
to
like
this,
but
then
it
does
not
have
the
sharp
edge
it
has
upstream
and
downstream
is
quite
ah
circular
I
mean
like
semi
circular
in
nature
you
understand.
So,
in
that
case
the
bar
shape
factor
is
minimum
1.76
ok.
What
does
that
signifies
this
value
the
drop
in
the
value
that
means,
shape
significantly
ah
influence
the
head
loss
is
not
it.
Then
we
have
the
w
which
is
like
the
width
of
the
bar
facing
the
flow
width
of
the
bar
individual
bar
b
is
the
clear
spacing
in
between
2
bars
ok
h
v
is
the
velocity
head
of
the
flow
approaching
the
bar
which
is
in
which
you
can
easily
find
find
out
this
velocity
head
by
v
square
by
2
g
ok.This
v
is
capital
V
is
the
geometrical
mean
of
the
approach
velocity
in
meter
per
second
and
g
obviously ,
you
know
the
accession
due
to
gravity
and
theta
is
the
angle
of
inclination
of
the
bar
with
the
horizontal.
ℎ=0.0729(𝑉2−𝑣2)
So,
if
it
has
certain
angle
say
like
you
know
if
it
is
like
a
straight
line
and
you
have
a
the
place
the
bar
is
placed
in
a
certain
angle.
So,
this
this
value
is
actually
represents
the
angle
of
inclination
of
the
bar
with
the
horizontal.
So,
normally
it
is
a
very
acceptable
practices
to
provide
a
head
loss
of
provide
a
additional
0.15
meter
of
ah
excess
head
in
case
if
it
is
like
you
know
because
it
does
not
normally
go
more
than
1.15
meter
like
almost
150
millimeter
it
is
quite
a
big
amount
of
jump.
So,
that
is
why
what
we
do
we
have
a
normal
sewer
line
incoming
line
coming
then
you
install
the
bar
after
then
you
have
a
certain
drop
then
you
it
goes
to
the
effluent
line
this
drop
should
be
somewhere
around
150
millimeter
you
can
you
can
go
ahead
with
the
150
millimeter
most
of
the
cases
as
a
thumb
rule
it
goes
ok.
So,
it
can
be
ah
for
the
hand
clean
if
you
see
the
ah
normally
for
the
hand
cleaned
screen
it
should
not
be
exceeding
0.3
meter
it
is
like
quite
high
300
millimeter
is
actually
quite
ah
like
you
know
huge.
So,
you
you
do
not
have
to
go
up
to
that
in
case
of
mechanically
clean
screen
sometimes
ah
if
your
mechanical
cleaning
ah
frequency
is
less.
So,
in
that
case
you
may
have
to
provide
high
amount
of
head
in
because
just
in
case
your
screen
will
start
clogging
and
your
ah
you
started
experience
a
high
amount
of
head
loss
just
in
order
to
nullify
that
loss
you
need
to
have
at
least
0.6
meter
of
drop
at
the
end.
So,
you
can
how
you
can
ah
get
the
formula
get
the
height
loss
with
the
different
formulas
as
well
for
the
clean
or
partially
clean
clogged
flat
bar
screen
you
can
see
it
is
0.0729
ah
capital
V
square
minus
small
v
square
that
is
that
h
is
the
loss
of
head
and
capital
V
is
the
velocity
through
the
screen
and
small
v
is
the
velocity
before
the
screen.
Obviously ,
through
the
screen
what
will
happen
the
area
is
small
it
will
the
velocity
will
be
much
higher .
The
head
loss
can
also
be
for
the
fine
screen
can
also
be
calculated
using
ah
1
by
2
g
into
C
D
multiplied
by
Q
by
A
square
where
g
is
the
acceleration
due
to
gravity
meter
per
second
square
C
D
is
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge
0.6
for
the
clean
rack
and
Q
is
the
dischar ge
through
screen
which
is
meter
cube
per
second
and
A
is
the
effective
open
submer ged
area
and
square
meter .h = (12𝑔×𝐶𝑑)(𝑄𝐴)2
In
general
the
clear
spacing
between
the
bar
may
be
in
the
range
of
15
millimeter
to
75
millimeter
maximum
normally
we
do
not
put
it
more
than
that.
So,
in
case
of
mechanically
cleaned
one
that
is
the
standard
practice
in
case
of
manually
clean
we
can
have
it
in
between
25
millimeter
to
50
millimeter
ok.
So,
in
general
for
industrial
waste
water
where
there
is
a
less
chance
of
having
ah
larger
size
particles
they
provide
as
low
as
6
millimeter
ah
gap
in
between
the
bar
which
is
quite
small
ok.
This
in
case
of
hand
clean
ah
screen
the
slope
should
be
around
30
to
60
degree
for
horizontal
with
the
horizontal
and
ah
for
mechanically
cleaned
it
should
be
45
to
85
degree
because
to
make
it
as
slopey
as
possible.
So,
that
in
case
the
frequency
is
low
for
your
mechanically
cleaned
device
it
can
still
you
know
sustain
like
reduces
the
chances
of
having
clog
clogging.
The
submer ged
area
as
I
was
discussing
should
be
at
least
200
times
more
in
case
of
processional
in
I
mean
like
to
the
surface
of
the
screen
and
300
time
300
percent
is
more
in
case
of
combined
systems
because
of
you
know
the
layer
higher
chances
of
peak
flow
and
higher
chances
of
storm
water
influence
there.
The
width
of
the
bar
facing
the
flow
may
vary
from
5
millimeter
to
15
millimeter
and
the
depth
may
vary
from
ah
25
millimeter
to
75
millimeter
with
size
less
than
5
millimeter
and
255
millimeter
are
not
used.
You
understand
right
this
what
depth
we
are
talking
about
this
depth
is
nothing,
but
suppose
you
have
a
ah
say
like
ah
one
bar
iron
bar
you
are
placing
a
lot
of
iron
bar
that
iron
bar
it
looks
like
a
rectangular
shape
ok.
In
this
rectangular
shape
iron
bar
the
one
that
is
facing
the
waste
water
is
obviously ,
the
smaller
one
the
width
will
be
small
almost
in
the
range
of
5
to
15
millimeter
and
the
depth
I
mean
the
other
side
of
it
if
you
make
a
cross
section
the
width
and
the
ah
the
the
height
it
will
be
like
an
if
you
consider
in
that
sense.
So,
it
will
be
25
millimeter
to
75
millimeter .
In
general
our
standard
consideration
we
put
it
either
5
millimeter
to
25
millimeter
ah
in
this
is
standard
practice.
What
is
the
quantities
of
screening
you
can
see
the
with
time
the
screenings
will
start
deposited
on
the
surface
of
the
screen
or
on
the
bottom
first
which
slowly
it
grows
on
the
surface.
So,
this
quantity
of
screening
which
should
be
removed
by
the
bar
screen
it
should
be
in
the
range
of
0.0035
to
0.0375
meter
cube
per
1000
meter
cube
of
waste
water
being
treated
and
typical
value
is
around
0.015
meter
cube
per
1000
meter
cube
of
waste
water .
And
in
case
of
combined
systems
the
this
is
quantity
of
screening
increases
during
the
storm
and
it
can
be
as
high
as
0.225
meter
cube
per
1000
meter
cube
per
water
waste
water .So,
that
also
you
have
to
keep
it
in
mind.
How
we
can
dispose
it
normally
we
dischar ge
we
use
this
ah
grinders
you
know
for
to
disintegrate
to
disintegrate
that
ah
screenings
and
we
can
also
if
for
the
larger
sewage
treatment
plant
we
can
also
incinerate
that
ah
treatment
unit
this
solid
waste
and
this
small
treatment
plant
we
normally
ah
dispose
it
off
to
the
burial
or
the
plant
sites
and
all.
Let
us
do
one
ah
design
by
ourselves
ok.
So,
to
boost
our
confidence
that
we
can
actually
do
the
design
by
ourselves
we
can
actually
design
a
screen
by
ourselves
for
any
wastewater
treatment
plant
to
start
with
let
us
see
what
this
problem
says.
It
says
that
design
a
bar
screen
chamber
for
average
sewage
flow
of
20
MLD
you
guys
know
what
is
MLD?
Million
liter
per
day
million
liter
means
10
to
the
power
6
liter
per
day
if
it
is
a
10
to
the
power
6
liter
in
1000
liter
it
is
1
meter
cube.
So,
that
means,
it
is
10
3
meter
cube
you
understand
1
million
liter
means
10
3
meter
cube.
That
means,
1000
meter
cube
1000
meter
cube
per
day
and
20
MLD
means
20000
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
20000
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
how
many
seconds
are
there
in
a
day
86400
is
not
it
60
into
16
to
24.
So,
if
you
divide
it
that
20000
meter
cube
divided
by
86400
you
will
get
the
value
as
0.231
meter
cube
per
second
you
understand
how
we
get
to
this
value.
So,
what
is
the
flow
rate
here
average
flow
20
million
liter
per
day
it
is
the
0.231
meter
cube
per
second
ok
in
liter
if
I
say
it
is
231
liter
per
second
ok.
What
is
the
maximum
flow
here
it
is
see
almost
1.5
times
to
the
average
flow
average
flow
was
20
maximum
flow
was
30
almost
1.5
times.
So,
peak
factor
is
1.5
here
anyway .
So,
that
is
just
for
you
to
understand
the
peak
factor
maximum
flow
is
now
30
MLD
same
do
the
calculation
by
yourself
30
MLD
means
30000
meter
cube
per
day
30000
divided
by
86400
it
will
become
0.347
meter
cube
per
second.
The
same
for
the
minimum
flow
it
is
point
for
12
MLD
12000
meter
cube
per
day
12000
divided
by
86400
it
will
become
0.139
meter
cube
per
second.
Now ,
assume
the
manual
cleaning
and
then
angle
of
inclination
of
the
bar
with
the
horizontal
as
30
degree
and
assume
the
size
of
the
bar
is
9
millimeter
by
50
millimeter
each
bar
is
9
millimeter
in
thickness
and
having
a
width
of
around
50
millimeter
ok.
And
assume
the
flow
rate
velocity
of
the
flow
is
around
0.3
meter
per
second
at
average
flow
please
remember
this
assumptions
ok.
So,
now
what
is
the
net
submer ged
area
of
the
screen
what
is
the
flow
here
0.231
what
is
the
if
you
divided
with
the
the
velocity
of
the
flow
normal
to
the
screen
which
is
0.3
meter
per
second
what
is
the
net
submer ged
area
what
does
that
mean
net
submer ged
area
mean
the
total
area
available
for
the
wastewater
to
pass
through
the
screen
total
area
available
for
the
wastewater
to
pass
through
the
screen.
So,
we
are
not
considering
the
cross
sectional
area
area
that
is
facing
the
the
area
that
is
available
for
each
screen
I
mean
like
each
bar
we
are
only
talk
of
talkabout
the
available
area
that
is
the
the
you
know
the
the
water
line
right
next
to
right
in
between
both
the
bar.
So,
like
that
you
have
say
like
100
of
bars.
So,
100
into
say
like
you
have
ah
that
particular
cross
sectional
area
say
like
1
square
meter .
So,
your
net
submer ged
area
is
100
into
1
square
meter .
So,
100
square
meter .
So,
that
is
your
net
submer ged
area
and
what
is
gross
submer ged
area
you
can
also
calculate
the
gross
submer ged
area
gross
submer ged
area
is
net
submer ged
area
plus
the
area
which
is
actually
taken
by
which
is
actually
influenced
by
the
I
mean
like
ah
occupied
by
the
individual
bar.
So,
now,
you
have
net
submer ged
area
which
like
the
water
area
plus
the
bar
area.
So,
from
there
you
can
get
the
gross
submer ged
area
ok.
So,
let
us
talk
about
the
net
submer ged
area
first
net
submer ged
area
you
know
you
can
easily
understand
the
flow
rate
is
231
meter
cube
per
second
divided
by
the
flow
velocity
you
can
get
the
area
ok
which
is
coming
as
0.77
square
meter .
Now ,
assume
the
velocity
of
flow
normal
to
the
screen
is
0.75
meter
per
second
in
case
of
maximum
flow
that
is
the
standard
standard
flow
actually .
So,
even
if
the
maximum
flow
is
0.75
meter
per
second
what
should
be
the
net
submer ged
area
in
case
of
peak
flow
because
for
peak
flow
we
know
what
is
the
peak
flow
here
30
MLD
that
means,
0.347
meter
cube
per
second
divided
by
the
velocity
of
flow
normal
to
the
screen
is
0.75.
So,
what
should
be
the
net
submer ged
area
0.46
meter
square.
So,
that
tells
k
in
case
of
peak
flow
in
case
of
maximum
flow
the
net
submer ged
area
is
rather
less
than
the
average
flow
here
in
this
particular
case.
So,
that
is
why
which
area
we
should
take
the
maximum
one
you
know
for
the
for
the
safety
purpose.
So,
we
will
take
the
maximum
one
say
0.77
square
meter .
So,
we
need
to
provide
at
least
0.77
square
meter
of
submer ged
net
submer ged
area
that
means,
you
have
the
rack.
So,
these
are
the
say
like
water
particle
which
is
water
which
is
going
from
one
side
to
another .
So,
height
of
this
water
is
say
up
to
this.
So,
this
area
the
this
in
between
area
is
the
net
submer ged
area
this
area
is
0.77
square
meter .
Now ,
how
you
can
get
the
gross
submer ged
area
just
try
to
understand
the
gross
submer ged
area
and
you
need
the
net
submer ged
area
ok.
So,
if
you
find
out
try
to
find
out
that
gross
submer ged
area
which
is
nothing,
but
if
you
try
to
make
a
ratio
say
in
here
say
you
have
n
number
of
bar
you
are
not
sure
that
what
is
the
number
of
bar
that
needs
to
be
given
right.
So,
if
you
have
a
n
number
of
bar.
So,
what
is
the
total
area
that
you
will
get
n
if
you
have
a
n
number
of
bar
what
will
happen
how
many
what
is
the
number
of
opening
that
you
can
have
you
understand.
So,
if
you
have
a
n
number
of
bar
you
have
a
n
plus
1
number
of
ah
opening
in
the
both
the
side
you
understand
if
you
have
a
n
number
of
bar
you
have
a
n
plus
1
number
of
opening.Now ,
for
each
opening
say
you
have
ah
say
now
you
have
say
like
ah
30
number
of
ah
what
is
it
called
ah
if
you
say
like
9
millimeter
of
facing
and
30
millimeter
of
spacing
in
between.
So,
what
will
happen?
So,
you
take
n
plus
1
multiplied
by
30
that
is
the
spacing
in
between
the
ah
both
the
bar.
Now ,
for
in
the
numerator
what
will
happen
total
number
of
submer ged
area
total
net
submer ged
area
will
be
n
plus
1
multiplied
by
30
that
will
be
the
net
submer ged
area
divided
by
what
will
happen
n
plus
1
30
n
plus
1
30
is
the
net
some
total
ah
some
net
submer ged
area
plus
n
into
9,
9
is
the
area
9
is
the
I
mean
like
the
width
of
the
each
ah
bar.
So,
now,
if
the
n
is
the
width
of
the
each
bar
facing
the
flow
multiplied
by
n.
So,
that
is
n
into
9.
So,
that
is
the
that
should
be
the
ah
total
ah
that
is
the
total
total
ah
width
I
would
say
the
gross
width.
So,
this
ratio
will
be
around
0.77
if
you
do
it.
So,
randomly
you
can
take
30
bar
or
you
can
say
20
bar
still
whatever
number
you
will
put
in
the
in
place
of
n
you
will
always
get
the
value
somewhere
near
to
the
77
0.77
you
understand
let
me
do
it
again
to
make
it
more
easier
for
you.
Suppose
you
have
a
5
number
of
bar
say
4
number
of
bar
1
2
3
4
4
number
of
bar.
So,
that
this
is
like
a
flat
screen
ok.
So,
in
this
each
flat
screen
you
have
a
this
water
some
amount
of
water
here.
So,
ah
if
you
have
say
like
ah
4
number
of
1
4
number
of
bar
in
between
and
there
is
a
wall
on
the
both
side.
So,
what
will
be
the
total
number
of
ah
cross
sectional
area
1
2
3
and
half
here
half
here.
So,
total
how
much
4
you
understand.
So,
not
only
we
have
this
ah
4
number
of
ah
a
multi
this
area
across
I
mean
like
available
area
that
is
ah
available
to
you
ah
sorry
5
number
of
area
that
is
available
to
you
1
2
3
4
5
5
number
area
that
is
available
to
you
multiplied
by
30
30
is
the
spacing
in
between
this
both
2
of
the
finger .
So,
divided
by
total
gross
gross
width
what
is
the
gross
width
here
n
plus
1
multiplied
by
ah
30
plus
suppose
each
bar
has
a
thickness
of
9
millimeter .
So,
n
into
9.
So,
9
into
n
plus
9
plus
n
plus
1
into
30
that
is
the
total
width.
So,
if
you
have
this
ratio
you
understand
the
net
submer ged
area
and
submer ged
width
divided
by
gross
submer ged
width
it
is
always
coming
around
0.77
you
you
put
20
in
this
equation
or
you
put
30
number
of
ah
instead
of
n
you
put
30
still
you
will
get
the
0.77
this
same
ratio
you
understand.
So,
if
you
get
the
same
ratio
all
the
time
that
means,
the
net
submer ged
area
ah
we
know
it
is
0.77
and
the
gross
submer ged
area
is
what
we
need
to
find
out.
So,
this
gross
submer ged
net
submer ged
area
divided
by
gross
submer ged
area
is
equal
I
mean
like
this
ratio
this
ratio
we
are
already
known
that
it
is
0.77
that
means,
the
gross
submer ged
area
is
equal
to
0.77
that
we
already
find
out
as
a
net
submer ged
area
divided
by
this
equation
this
ratio
that
we
got
like
0.77
this
value
that
means,
the
gross
submer ged
area
that
you
require
is
1
square
meter
that
means,
including
this
bar
including
this
bar
from
this
say
like
wall
thiswall
to
this
wall
including
the
if
you
have
a
water
level
up
to
this
the
whole
area
is
the
gross
gross
submer ged
area
which
will
be
1
square
meter .
I
hope
you
understand
net
submer ged
area
is
the
only
the
water
level
this
area
which
is
occupied
by
the
water
and
gross
submer ged
area
is
the
total
area
water
area
plus
individual
rack
ok.
So,
now,
if
you
have
a
now
once
we
know
once
we
have
already
understood
the
gross
submer ged
area
that
is
required
is
1
square
meter
and
we
know
that
the
say
like
now
the
angle
that
is
there
for
each
I
mean
like
the
angle
at
which
the
the
bar
is
placed
the
bar
screen
is
placed
say
like
30
degree
degree.
So,
what
will
happen?
So,
total
submer ged
vertical
cross
section
area
that
is
there
this
x
value
how
you
will
get
the
x
value
if
you
know
we
know
the
y
gross
submer ged
area
which
is
1
square
meter
very
good.
So,
now,
we
need
to
understand
the
value
of
x
how
we
can
find
out
the
value
of
x
x
is
nothing,
but
y
into
sin
theta
what
is
this
theta
here
30
degree.
So,
that
means,
y
is
known
to
us
y
is
what
1
square
meter
multiplied
by
sin
theta.
So,
that
means,
the
x
value
will
be
0.5
square
meter
ok.
So,
from
here
that
means,
we
know
the
vertical
cross
sectional
area
vertical
cross
sectional
area
of
the
submer ged
vertical
cross
sectional
area
of
the
screen
as
0.5
square
meter .
Now ,
we
know
the
flow
we
know
the
flow
rate
and
we
also
know
the
vertical
cross
sectional
area
now
ok
submer ged
vertical
cross
sectional
area
and
the
flow
rate
is
how
much
0.231.
You
remember
0.231
20
MLD
and
the
vertical
cross
sectional
area
is
0.5.
So,
if
you
flow
rate
divided
by
this
vertical
cross
sectional
area
you
will
get
the
velocity
you
will
get
the
ah
the
velocity
of
flow
in
the
ah
screen
chamber
which
is
nothing,
but
0.462.
So,
the
velocity
is
greater
than
the
self
cleansing
velocity
which
is
good
because
you
remember
we
it
needs
to
be
at
least
more
than
at
least
0.42
meter
per
second
as
we
were
discussing
in
the
last
slide.
So,
now,
our
design
is
good.
Next
is
now
we
say
take
for
30
number
of
bar.
Remember
we
discussed
either
20
to
30
randomly
you
can
take
it,
but
still
the
ratio
is
coming
as
0.77.
So,
now,
let
us
take
30
number
of
bar.
So,
what
will
be
the
gross
width
30
into
9
millimeter
that
is
0.009
meter
plus
31
that
is
the
amount
of
space
available
because
30
number
of
bar
and
2
wall
in
the
last
in
the
in
the
both
the
side.
So,
in
between
wall
and
bar
also
there
is
another
1
gap
another
2
gap
in
the
both
side.
So,
total
number
of
gap
will
be
n
plus
1
ok.
So,
31
number
of
gaps
are
there
31
number
of
gaps
and
30
millimeter
is
the
gap
in
between
both
the
bar
so
that
means,
0.03
ok,
0.03
meter .
So,
now,
what
is
the
total
gross
width
1.2
meter .
Now
we
know
the
we
already
know
the
liquid
depth
what
is
the
liquid
depth
submer ged
ah
depth
is
0.5
meter
0.5
square
meter
and
we
also
know
the
gross
width
which
is
1.2.
So,
how
we
can
find
out
the
liquid
depth?
We
know
the
cross
sectional
area
remember
submer ged
cross
sectional
area
vertical
cross
sectional
area
0.5
square
meter
divided
by
the
total
width
gross
width
1.2.
So,
we
can
get
the
what
we
will
get
this
value
is
nothing,
but
the
liquid
depth
you
understand.
So,
we
know
the
in
the
earlier
picture
in
the
earlier
ah
slide
we
already
get
to
know
about
the
size
I
mean
the
area
the
vertical
cross
sectional
areathere
which
is
0.5
square
meter
and
this
slide
we
actually
get
the
vertical
depth
I
mean
like
the
liquid
depth.
So,
now,
we
need
to
provide
some
free
board
say
another
0.3
meter .
So,
total
will
be
somewhere
around
0.75
meter .
So,
what
will
be
the
size
of
your
channel?
1.2
meter
in
width
and
0.75
meter
in
depth
there
you
can
place
your
ah
I
mean
like
your
ah
screen.
Now ,
how
we
can
find
out
the
bed
slope?
The
slope
that
you
need
to
maintain
in
your
channel
simply
using
the
Manning's
formula
you
can
find
out
the
hydraulic
radius
R
equal
to
ah
area
available
and
divided
by
the
weighted
perimeter
area
is
0.416
is
a
liquid
depth
multiplied
by
the
the
gross
width
1.2
meter
divided
by
weighted
perimeter .
Weighted
perimeter
means
only
the
areas
which
are
actually
kind
of
in
order
to
for
you
to
easily
remember
is
the
area
which
is
available
say
for
rectangular
channel
which
is
connected
to
the
surf
connected
to
the
some
of
the
surfaces
on
the
side
on
the
side
of
it.
So,
in
the
both
the
side
it
is
like
2
into
b.
So,
2
into
b
is
one
side
is
say
water
is
connected
to
the
one
side
this
side
like
you
know .
So,
if
the
liquid
depth
is
ah
liquid
depth
I
mean
like
the
water
depth
is
say
like
0.416
meter .
So,
416
on
the
right
side
416
on
the
left
side
plus
the
distance.
What
is
the
distance
here?
The
gross
width
1.2.
So,
how
we
can
find
out
the
P
here?
2
b
into
ah
normally
the
formula
is
2
b
into
d
say
like
2
b
plus
d.
So,
2
b
is
the
like
here
the
depth
and
d
is
the
distance.
So,
2
x
0.416
+
1.2.
So,
hydraulic
radiance
is
become
0.246
meter .
Now
according
to
the
Manning's
formula
from
there
you
can
easily
find
out
the
value
of
S
ok.𝑉=(1𝑛)𝑅2/3𝑆1/2
So,
value
of
S
ah
is
coming
how
much?
It
is
coming
as
a
0.0153.
Therefore,
the
bed
slope
has
to
be
1
in
4272
meter
that
should
be
the
slope
that
you
need
to
provide.
And
this
head
loss
ah
it
is
that
you
have
calculated
that
this
value
S
is
now
ah
bed
slope
is
around
1
in
4272
meter .
Now
suppose
the
head
loss
through
the
screen
when
the
screen
is
not
clogged
that
is
the
value
in
case
of
the
how
we
can
find
out
the
age
value
then.
You
remember
that
equation
we
find
out
that
ℎ=β(𝑊/𝑏)4/3ℎ𝑣𝑆𝑖𝑛θ 
we
know
everything
we
know
the
it
is
a
rectangular
bar
screen.
So,
we
know
the
shape
factor
2.42
W
is
known
to
us
ah
9
which
is
like
the
width
of
theindividual
bar
ah
we
know
the
gap
30
millimeter
4
by
3
h
v
is
known
to
us
V
square
by
2
g
V
square
equal
to
0.462
we
already
find
out
divided
by
2
into
g
acceleration
due
to
gravity
9.81
sin
into
theta
theta
is
30.
ℎ=2.42(9/30)4/3[(0.462)2/(2 𝑥 9.81)]𝑆𝑖𝑛30 
So,
from
there
we
get
the
2.65
millimeter
is
the
head
loss
that
only
2.65
millimeter
even
if
the
screen
is
half
clogged
that
means,
value
of
b
is
now
1
ah
15
millimeter
earlier
the
gap
was
30
now
say
it
is
15
millimeter
half
half
of
the
portion
is
clogged
half
of
the
bar
is
already
clogged.
Now ,
it
is
ah
like
half
of
the
bar
area
is
already
clogged
for
the
whole
whole
I
mean
like
the
for
the
whole
gross
area.
Now ,
it
is
become
the
area
available
ah
for
the
water
to
pass
through
is
15
millimeter
even
for
15
millimeter
of
also
if
you
again
ah
use
the
value
of
b
as
15
millimeter
in
this
equation
you
will
find
out
the
value
of
H
is
6.67
millimeter
still
it
is
quite
less
than
the
150
millimeter
which
is
a
standard
practice.
So,
we
can
easily
provide
150
millimeter
of
drop
without
worrying
without
worrying
about
anything
ok.
So,
if
this
head
loss
is
excessive
this
can
be
somehow
reduced
by
providing
bar
of
rounded
edge
on
the
upstream
or
by
reducing
the
width
of
bar
from
6
millimeter
to
ah
see
ah
like
normally
reducing
the
width
of
6
to
8
millimeter
or
ah
by
slight
reduction
in
the
velocity
ok.
So,
in
general
what
we
have
understood
ah
in
this
ah
problem
I
would
ah
in
this
particular
lecture
video
I
would
really
like
to
request
you
to
go
through
this
lecture
video
more
and
more
time
to
you
know
for
you
to
understand
it
very
ah
I
mean
like
in
in
in
depth
it
is
very
important
for
you
to
understand
this
ah
this
problem
statement
specially
the
numerical
that
you
should
follow .
So,
that
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
design
in
future
for
any
other
purposes
for
ah
I
mean
at
for
your
client.
So,
different
type
of
screens
we
discuss
the
design
also
we
discuss
the
various
elements
and
requirements
and
specification
also
we
ah
discussed
several
methods
in
general
for
consideration
for
disposable
screening
also
we
discuss
that
it
is
a
grinder ,
incineration
or
the
burial
in
the
sanitary
landfill.
These
are
the
references
that
you
should
follow
and
I
hope
you
understand
the
design
of
screen
understand
the
all
the
ah
important
information
regarding
screen
in
this
lecture
if
you
have
any
queries
please
reach
to
me
I
will
be
very
happy
to
help
you
with
that
ok.
Thank
you
so
much
see
you
in
the
next
video.
