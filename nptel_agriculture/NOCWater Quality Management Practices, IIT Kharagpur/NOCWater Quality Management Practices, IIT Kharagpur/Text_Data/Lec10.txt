Determination
of
Nitrogen,
Phosphorus
&
Microbial
Counts
 
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality 
Management 
Practices. 
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharbomic
from
the 
Department
of
Agricultural
and
Food 
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology 
Kharagpur ,
India. 
So,
continuing
to
my
discussion
with
the
quantity
estimation
of
major 
pollutants
in
water
in 
the
waste
water ,
today
we
will
be
giving
you
the
last
lecture
of
this 
module
and
we
will 
discuss
about
the
how
determination
procedure
for
nitrogen,
phosphorus 
and
the
microbial 
counts. 
The
concept
that
I
will
be
covering
here
majorly
the
determination 
of
nitrogenous
compound, 
the
ammoniacal
nitrogen,
nitrate
nitrogen,
nitrate
nitrogen
and
the 
total
Kjeldahl
nitrogen 
and
determination
of
phosphorus
concentration
and
the
determination 
of
most
probable
number 
for
coliform
microor ganisms
quantification. 
Determination
of 
nitrogen
in
general
the
nitrogen
content
in
sanitary
sewage
is
about
15
to 
50
milligram
per 
liter. 
In
waste
water
it
may
present
in
organic
or
inorganic
form
under
reduced
or
oxidized 
form.
 
In
general
they
present
either
in
nitrite,
nitrate,
ammoniacal
or
Kjeldahl
nitrogen
form. 
What
is
this
Kjeldahl
nitrogen? 
Kjeldahl
nitrogen
is
kind
of
a
giving
us
combined 
understanding
about
the
the
ammoniacal
as 
well
as
the
organic
nitrogen
present
in
your 
waste
water . 
So,
we
have
nitrite
and
nitrate
and
then
we
have
ammonia
and
organic 
nitrogen. 
So,
ammonia
and
organic
nitrogen
gives
us
the
understanding
about
the
total 
Kjeldahl
nitrogen 
and
nitrate
and
nitrate
is
also
separate.
 
So,
which
is
also
considered
as
inorganic
component
of
nitrogen
waste
present
in
the 
waste 
water . 
So,
this
ammoniacal
nitrogen
in
order
to
determine
this
ammoniacal
nitrogen
the 
sample
pH
has 
to
be
adjusted
to
9.5
using
6
normal
sodium
hydroxide
solution
to
reduce
the 
hydrolysis 
of
organic
nitrogenous
compounds. 
To
determine
the
ammonia
by
titration 
method
normally
we
select
the
sample
volume
of
250, 
100,
50,
25
milliliter
for
2
to
10,
10
to 
20,
20
to
50
and
50
to
100
milligram
per
liter 
of
ammoniacal
nitrogen
concentration
present 
in
a
sample
respectively . 
We
need
to
collect
approximately
1
gram
of
dry
weight
of
sludge
or 
the
sediment
sample 
in
crucible
and
then
wash
and
dilute
it
to
250
ml
in
a
general
flux.
 
So,
this
procedure
is
only
this
procedure
is
for
the
sludge
the
solids
. 
In
order
to
we
then
we 
carry
out
the
distillation
process
in
a
boric
acid
solution
and
collect 
only
100
ml
in
of
the 
distillate. 
This
then
in
terms
of
waste
water
because
our
concern
is
majorly
waste
water
in 
case 
of
waste
water
what
we
do
we
add
25
ml
of
borate
buffer
to
500
ml
of
waste
water 
sample 
and
adjust
the
pH
to
9.5
using
6
normal
sodium
hydroxide
solution. 
Then
we
carry 
the
distillation
at
6
to
10
milliliter
per
minute
with
the
delivery
tube 
tip
being
immersed
in
a 
recovering
receiving
boric
acid
solution.
 
Then
we
collect
at
least
200
ml
of
distillate
from
the
top
and
then
we
dilute
it
to
500 
ml 
with
the
standard
0.02
normal
sulfuric
acid
titrant
in
presence
of
mixed
indicators 
containing 
methyl
red
and
the
methylene
blue. 
When
the
color
turns
from
the
to
the
till
the
color
turns
to 
the
pale
lavenderish
in 
nature. 
The
same
process
has
to
be
carried
out
for
a
blank
solution
as 
well
like
not
the
waste 
water ,
but
the
actual
distilled
water
and
all. 
And
then
what
we
will
do 
then
ammonical
nitrogen
present
in
the
sample
can
be
easily
estimated 
with
this
equation
for 
liquid
sample. 
Ammonical
nitrogen
(mg/L)
=
. 
This
A
is
nothing,
but
the
volume
of(ùê¥‚àíùêµ)√ó280ùëâùëúùëôùë¢ùëöùëí ùëúùëì ùëÜùëéùëöùëùùëôùëí (ùëöùêø) 
sulfuric
acid
titrated
for
sample
and
in
ml
and
B
is 
the
volume
of
sulfuric
acid
titrated
for 
blank
in
ml
as
well. 
And
for
the
sludge
also
is
the
same,
but
the
unit
will
be
milligram
per 
kg. 
For
nitrite
nitrogen
NO
2
negative
is
determined
by
associating
the
this
diatodite
sulfur 
and
amide
with
NAD
dehydrochloride
through
the
intermediate
formation
of
a
reddish 
purple 
azo
dye
at
pH
2
to
2.5. 
Presence
of
nitrogen
trichloride
gives
the
false
red
color
after 
the
addition
of 
this
color
regions
and
any
suspended
solid
in
the
sample
must
be
filtered 
before
only 
as
the
presence
of
colored
ions
may
actually
alter
the
color . 
Fresh
samples 
should
be
used
for
nitrates
determination
as
bacteria
present
may
start 
converting
the
nitrate 
into
nitrate
very
fast
or
to
ammonia. 
The
sample
can
only
be
also
be
stored
between
4 
degree
to
minus
20
degree
Celsius
for 
the
next
1
or
2
days. 
And
this
nitrate
nitrogen
then 
we
filter
50
ml
of
this
wastewater
sample
through
a
0.45 
micron
pore
size
of
membrane.
 
Grass
filter
paper
normally
we
can
take
and
then
we
bring
the
pH
down
to
bit
bit
around 
5 
to
9
with
1
normal
HCl
or
ammonium
hydroxide
followed
by
addition
of
2
ml
of
color 
reagent. 
We
use
the
spectrophotometer
between
10
minutes
to
200
2
hours
to
measure
the 
absorbance 
at
543
nanometer . 
Using
this
light
path
as
1
5
and
10
centimeter
for
2
to
for
25 
2
to
6
and
the
less
than
2 
micro
liter
microgram
per
liter
of
nitrite
concentration
respectively 
to
plot
the
absorbance 
and
formulate
a
standard
curve
from
which
we
can
easily
find
out
the 
concentration
of 
the
sample
the
estimate
the
concentration
of
the
sample. 
So,
how
we
can
do 
it
for
the
nitrate
nitrogen? 
We
determine
the
nitrate
nitrogen
using
the
spectrophotometer
at 
only
1
wavelength
 
as
only
the
1
wavelength
and
sometimes
is
difficult
going
to
a
it
like
you 
know
it 
is
being
able
to
absorb
the
UV
light
as
well
like
other
dissolved
organic
matter
and 
solute. 
So,
the
UV
spectrophore
nitrite
and
nitrite
nitrate
and
nitrate
are
similar .
 
However ,
nitrate
concentration
is
usually
much
higher
in
polluted
water
than
the
nitrate 
because
it
is
it
can
be
easily
converted
into
nitrate. 
This
UV
absorbance
spectrum
reaches
to 
a
peak
of
203
nanometer
when
nitrate
nitrogen 
concentration
is
less
than
3
milligram
per 
liter
and
the
slit
width
of
slit
width
of 
spectrophotometer
may
also
affect
this
profile
of
this 
UV
that
also
we
need
to
be
concerned 
we
need
to
be
concerned
about. 
In
general
what
we 
do
we
prepare
the
filtered
sample
water
at
the
wastewater
and
take
50 
ml
of
it
and
we
add
the 
1
ml
of
1
normal
HCL
solution
and
we
mixed
it
well. 
Then
we
measure
the
absorbance
and 
220
nanometer
against
the
distilled
water
sample
for
which 
the
absorbance
is
set
to
0
to 
obtain
the
actual
nitrate
absorbance
rating
. 
Now ,
this
absorbance
rating
is
determined
at
275 
nanometer
to
determine
the
interference 
due
to
the
presence
of
dissolved
organic
matter
and 
from
the
absorbance
reading
at
220
nanometer 
subtract
twice
the
absorbance
reading
at
275 
nanometer
to
get
the
absorbance
due
to 
the
nitrate
ions.
 
We
can
also
do
the
construct
the
standard
curve
for
absorbance
of
nitrate
versus 
the
known 
nitrate
nitrogen
concentration
and
thus
using
this
collected
sample
absorbance 
the
nitrate 
concentration
present
can
be
easily
estimated
from
this
curve. 
From
this
graph
if
you
see
the 
sea
surface
nitrate
concentration
in
milli
mole
of 
milli
mole
normal
it
in
like
you
know
in 
in
in
in
per
meter
cube. 
If
you
see
its
nitrogen
per
meter
cube
if
you
see
the
purple
ones
are 
actually
considering 
like
you
know
giving
us
a
very
low
concentration
whereas,
the
red
and 
the
the
the
yellowish 
ones
it
is
giving
us
the
high
concentration
which
is
normally
is
the
in 
the
polar
region. 
Total
Zelda
nitrogen
another
very
important
thing
as
I
was
discussing
you 
that
the 
total
Zelda
nitrogen
it
is
represented
by
the
ammoniacal
nitrogen
plus
what
the 
organic 
nitrogen
remember . 
So,
it
it
includes
the
proteins
peptides
urea
and
many
other 
synthetic
organic
compounds 
as
well
. 
So,
fresh
samples
you
should
always
be
used
and
you
should
analyze
it
with
the
fresh 
sample 
only
then
you
have
to
acidify
it
with
the
concentrated
sulphuric
acid
say
at
1.5
to 
2 
pH
and
then
store
it
at
4
degree
Celsius. 
Then
you
can
select
the
different
sample
size
and 
you
based
on
that
you
add
800
ml 
of
Kjeldahl
flux
added
in
the
Kjeldahl
flux
and
you
can 
see
the
Kjeldahl
flux
how
it
looks 
like
and
then
you
adjust
the
sample
pH
to
7.0. 
Now
you 
can
add
25
ml
of
borate
buffer
followed
by
6
normal
of
NaOH
till
the
pH
of
9.5
is 
achieved 
thenboil
the
solution
after
adding
the
glass
beads
. 
Now
cool
the
Kjeldahl
flux
and
you 
carefully
add
20
ml
of
digestion
reagent
consisting 
of
6.7
gram
of
K2SO4
and
0.365
gram
of 
CuSO4
and
6.7
milliliter
of
concentrated 
H2SO4
in
the
distillation
flask.
 
Now
we
boil
the
arrangement
till
profuse
white
fumes
where
you
start
observing
and
the 
volume 
comes
down
to
25
to
50
ml. 
Now
you
continue
the
digestion
for
30
minute
till
the 
sample
turns
into
pale
green
and 
cool
it
and
dilute
it
with
a
300
ml
of
distilled
water . 
Now 
what
you
need
to
do
once
you
added
with
this
distilled
water
you
connect
the
flux 
in
a 
steamed
out
distillation
apparatus
and
the
pH
of
the
solution
should
not
should 
obviously , 
exit
the
11.0
I
mean
like
the
pH
and
now
you
collect
a
200
ml
of
distillate 
from
this
in
this 
50
in
a
50
ml
boric
acid
solution
with
the
tip
of
the
condenser
below 
the
level
of
boric
acid 
absorbent
solution
and
maintain
the
temperature
in
the
condenser 
below
29
degree
Celsius. 
You
there
are
apparatus
nowadays
which
are
available
which
can
do
this
kind
of
operations 
by
itself.
 
Now
you
have
to
titrate
it
using
0.02
normal
H2SO4. 
You
titrate
it
until
the
color
turns
into 
pale
lavender . 
Now
this
organic
nitrogen
can
be
easily
estimated
by
this
equation
that
you
have. 
A
is
nothing,
but
the
volume
of
sulphuric
acid
that
is(ùê¥‚àíùêµ)√ó280ùëâùëúùëôùë¢ùëöùëí ùëúùëì ùëÜùëéùëöùëùùëôùëí (ùëöùêø) 
needed
for
titrating
the
sample.
 
B
is
the
volume
of
sulphuric
acid
that
is
needed
for
titrating
the
blank
. 
The
summation
of 
ammoniacal
nitrogen
and
organic
nitrogen
gives
us
the
TKN
the
total 
geldal
nitrogen
present 
in
your
sample
understood. 
This
is
the
standard
methods
given
by
the
American
Public 
Health
Associations
there 
are
other
methods
as
well,
but
this
is
one
of
the
simplest
one
and 
that
is
been
widely 
followed. 
Determination
of
phosphate
phosphorus
in
general
in 
wastewater
majorly
the
phosphorus 
is
coming
from
the
detrituses
and
the
body
of
aquatic 
organisms
only. 
Other
than
that
nowadays
people
you
know
nowadays
agricultural
runof f
is 
becoming 
one
of
the
major
source
of
this
phosphorus
present
in
the
present
in
the 
wastewater .
 
It
normally
can
be
classified
in
it
normally
stays
in
the
form
of
orthophosphate
or
the 
condensed
phosphate
or
organically
bound
phosphates
is
not
it. 
So,
what
are
the
major 
sources
that
I
was
saying
it
is
pollution
from
the
sewage,
industrial 
waste,
application
of
the 
fertilizers
and
the
from
the
natural
contact
with
the
minerals 
that
can
also
leach
some
amount 
of
phosphorus
to
the
groundwater
or
the
surface
water . 
We
normally
calculate
this 
phosphorus
in
two
steps
. 
The
first
one
we
convert
the
phosphorus
into
dissolved 
orthophosphate
and
the
second
we 
this
dissolved
orthophosphate
it
determined
by
following 
the
colorimetric
method. 
So,
once
we
know
the
presence
of
dissolved
orthophosphate
in
the 
colorimetric
method 
we
based
on
the
equations
that
we
developed
for
this
conversion 
process
we
can
easily 
get
the
value
of
the
phosphate
present
in
your
in
a
sample.
 
The
process
is
very
simple
we
take
the
50
ml
of
water
in
a
sample
of
gilder
flask
and 
add
1 
ml
of
concentrated
H2SO4
and
followed
by
5
ml
of
concentrated
HNO3. 
Then
we
digested 
to
a
volume
of
10
ml
and
continue
until
the
solution
becomes
colorless. 
We
then
cool
downthe
sample
and
add
20
ml
of
distilled
water ,
add
a
drop
of
phenolphthalein 
indicator
and
start 
adding
one
normal
NaOH
solution
slowly
until
the
faint
pink
color 
appears
again. 
Then
we 
transfer
it
to
100
ml
of
volumetric
flask
to
dilute
it
up
to
100
ml
with
the
distilled 
water
and 
take
20
ml
of
the
sample
we
add
4
ml
of
ammonium
molybdenum
molybdate
reagent 
followed
by
10
drops
of
stannous
chloride
reagent. 
After
10
minute
we
measure
the 
absorbance
in
a
spectrophotometer
at
690
nanometer
of 
for
its
absorbance
value
and 
compare
it
with
the
calibration
curve
using
the
distilled 
water
as
a
blank.
 
So,
from
there
we
can
easily
calculate
the
phosphate
using
this
following
formula. 
The 
weight
of
the
phosphorus
in
milligram
and
in
approximately
104.5
milliliter
of
 
milliliter
of 
in
final
volume
divided
by
the
volume
of
the
sample
multiplied
by
the
1000. 
From
here
we 
can
get
the
value
of
phosphorus
in
milligram
per
liter. 
So,
this
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
as
I 
was
saying
it
is
one
of
the
major
kind
of
nuisance 
sometime
for
our
wastewater
treatment 
plant.
 
So,
that
we
have
to
worry
about
we
normally
also
make
sure
that
our
nutrients
are 
at
ease 
we
try
to
reduce
the
concentration
of
it
by
we
reduce
try
to
employ
some
amount 
of 
treatment
plant
and
all. 
So,
specifically
for
it. 
So,
. 
So,
separate
like
other
than
that
we 
another
important
pollutant
that
we
also
need
to
understand 
is
the
microbial
count. 
The 
majorly
the
colony
forms
which
are
used
to
detect
the
bacterial
contamination.
 
So,
the
um
multi
tube
multiple
tube
fermentation
technique
is
generally
used
to
identify
the 
presence
of
coliforms
which
would
act
as
an
indicator
organisms
in
general. 
The
coliforms 
being
the
the
enterobacteriaceae
family
and
are
facultative
and
anaerobes 
and
non
spore 
forming
and
they
are
gram
negative
in
nature
. 
The
most
probable
number
MPN
it
actually 
represents
the
number
of
this
multiple
tube
fermentations 
that
is
the
probability
of
the 
number
of
poly
forms
present
in
a
sample
per
100 
ml
that
is
one
of
the
most
famous
way
of 
representing
the
MPNs. 
How
we
can
determine
the
this
microbial
count? 
We
can
simply 
suspend
you
know
35.6
gram
of
laurel
tryptos
broth
or
L
T
L
T
B 
in
1
liter
of
distilled 
water
and
dissolve
the
medium
completely .
 
We
use
3
groups
of
5
test
tubes
and
add
9
ml
of
broth
to
each
test
tube
containing 
inverted 
derham
tubes
to
detect
the
fermentation
grass. 
Now
sterilize
before
doing
a
we
have
to 
sterilize
and
then
we
have
to
sterilize
all
the
tubes 
and
in
in
an
autoclave
at
120
degree
21 
degree
Celsius
for
15
minutes
and
we
cool
it
down 
in
a
laminar
flow
chamber
under
UV 
light. 
So,
to
reduce
any
kind
of
you
know
contamination
to
reduce
the
chances
of
any
kind
of 
contamination. 
Then
we
transfer
1
ml
of
sample
to
each
5
tubes
of
1
group
of
broth
and
we 
add 
0.1
ml
of
sample
to
5
tubes
of
next
group
of
broth
and
we
add
0.
01
ml
of
say
sample 
of
5
tubes
of
remaining
last
group
of
broth
tubes. 
Then
we
incubate 
the
tubes
at
35
degree
Celsius
for
24
hour
if
no
gas
or
acid
reaction
evident 
by
the
shades
of 
yellow
color
is
evident
after
24
hour
continue
we
continue
it
until
48
hour 
and
reexamine. 
After
incubation
we
observe
the
fermentation
gas
in
the
derham
tubes
and
we
record
the 
number
of
positive
result
from
each
set
and
compare
it
with
the
standard
chart
that 
is
given 
for
to
give
the
presumptive
polyform
count
per
100
ml
and
for
the
combination
of 
tubes
not 
appearing
in
the
standard
chart
MPN
can
be
determined
using
the
following 
formula
majorly 
if
the
number
of
positive
tubes
in
200
divided
by
root
over
of
ml
of 
sample
in
negative
tubes 
multiplied
by
ml
of
sample
in
all
tubes. 
So,
in
general
we
in
this
particular
lecture
video
it 
was
quite
fast
because
I
do
not 
want
to
go
in
much
details
about
it
you
can
easily
get
all
this 
information
in
the 
in
any
regular
you
know
later
video
I
mean
regular
textbo
also
that
howto
determine 
the
TKN
how
to
determine
the
nitrite
nitrate
phosphate
phosphorus
or
the
MPN.
 
So,
that
is
why
I
make
it
very
short. 
So,
we
know
that,
but
however ,
it
is
very
important
for 
us
to
at
least
discuss
during 
this
lecture
series
because
we
need
to
understand
that
how
this 
how
this
nitrogen
and
the
phosphorus 
is
impacting
our
treatment
in
it. 
Specially
the
nitrogen 
when
we
talk
about
it
is
very
important
because
unless
until 
we
know
the
negative
effect
of 
nitrogen
in
our
waste
water
in
our
treatment
I
mean 
like
in
the
follow
up
systems
it
is
very 
hard
for
us
to
understand
and
also
we
need
to
understand 
the
basic
testing
test
procedures 
and
all
right. 
So,
normally
whenever
you
will
be
designing
we
will
be
discussing
in
coming 
modules
when 
you
will
be
designing
any
say
like
aerobic
or
aerobic
treatment
unit
we
need 
to
be
sure 
about
it
that
our
treatment
system
is
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
it
can 
biologically 
remove
the
nitrogen
or
the
phosphorus
present
in
our
systems
specifically
in 
nitrogen. 
How
we
can
do? 
We
can
do
it
aerobically
as
you
know
the
nitrification
process
it 
requires
the
oxygen
it
is
oxygen 
scavenging
process. 
However ,
it
requires
oxygen
and
it
that 
because
of
the
process
of
nitrification
the
ammonia 
will
be
converted
into
nitrate
and
nitrate 
finally .
 
This
nitrate
if
you
want
to
remove
it
further
remove
it
from
the
system
further
that
also 
we 
can
do. 
How
we
can
do? 
You
can
remove
that
additional
amount
of
nitrate
by
the
process 
called
denitrification
. 
There
are
by
denitrification
process
this
nitrate
will
be
converted
into 
dinitrogen 
gas. 
You
can
do
further
some
more
stuffs
you
can
do
this
there
are
concepts
like 
you
know
an 
amox
process
which
is
coming
by
which
actually
we
can
actually
directly 
remove
the
ammonia 
into
dinitrogen
gas
is
also
possible. 
There
are
processes
by
which
we 
can
actually
do
the
the
we
call
the
air
stripping 
processes
by
which
also
we
can
actually
get 
rid
of
the
ammonia
from
the
systems.
 
Anyway
so,
there
are
there
are
different
procedures
by
which
actually
we
can
get
rid
of
the 
nitrogen 
from
the
waste
water
and
in
this
is
one
of
the
foremost
necessity
for
whenever
we 
will
be
designing
in
future
that
different
type
of
treatment
plant
for
our
city
for 
say 
municipality
or
say
like
for
our
industry
that
how
much
is
the
nitrogen
component
and 
it 
whether
it
is
it
can
remove
the
nitrogen
or
not
because
that
is
one
of
the
major
criteria 
for 
any
regulatory
bodies. 
We
discussed
about
the
how
we
can
treat
this
how
we
can
actually 
determine
this
different
type
of
nitrogen
components. 
We
discuss
about
the
ammoniacal 
nitrogen,
we
discuss
about
the
nitrate
nitrite,
we
discuss 
how
phosphate
phosphorus
can
also 
be
determined,
we
also
discussed
how
the
MPN
the
most
probable 
number
in
number
of
like 
microor ganisms
per
100
ml
of
say
waste
water
is
present
that 
is
also
kind
of
a
one
of
the 
best
quantifying
criteria
that
whether
your
final
effluent 
is
easily
dischar geable
into
the 
surface
water
or
not. 
Even
that
is
one
of
the
major
criteria
for
you
to
understand
whether
it
is 
a
drinkable
or
not. 
If
it
is
it
is
0,
if
that
MPN
value
is
0
almost
0
then
it
can
be
almost 
considered
as
a
in 
the
portable
water
or
drinkable
water
considering
all
the
other
factors
are
.
 
So,
these
are
the
some
of
the
things
in
this
particular
lecture
module
I
hope
you
understood 
different
major
pollutants
that
is
present
in
the
waste
water
and
you
also
understand 
that
the 
what
are
the
significance
of
all
these
pollutants
and
from
next
module
onwards 
we
will
be 
going
into
more
in
details
about
the
process
factors
about
the
process
chemistry 
and
also
the 
we
will
do
some
reactor
engineering
and
then
we
will
continue
with
the
actual 
plant
design 
and
how
actually
we
need
to
go
designing
the
different
plant
which
can 
actually
treat
those 
waste
water
or
the
water
which
is
very
important
for
us. 
I
was
as
I
was
saying
it
is
very 
important
for
all
of
us
to
understand
this
water
engineering 
and
where
the
water
is
coming 
into
your
glass
or
what
is
the
fate
of
the
water
that
is
coming 
into
your
household
isn't
it. 
So,this
is
very
important
for
all
of
us
to
know
and
we
will
be
discussing
more
in 
details
about 
all
these
things
in
the
coming
lecture. 
Please
follow
these
references
where
they
from
where 
actually
this
materials
are
like 
materials
materials
are
actually
been
taken
and
this
is
the 
papers
and
the
bos
are
very 
important
very
nice
and
lot
of
information
can
be
gathered 
through
while
you
read
these 
bos
and
all
. 
So,
thank
you
so
much
I
hope
you
understand 
and
actually
enjoy
this
particular
module 
and
we
will
see
you
in
the
next
module. 
Thank 
you
so
much.
