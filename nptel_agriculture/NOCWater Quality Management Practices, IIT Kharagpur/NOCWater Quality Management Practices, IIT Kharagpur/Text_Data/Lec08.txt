Determination
of
BOD,
COD
&
TOC
Hello
everyone,
welcome
all
of
you
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dhar
Bhaumik.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology ,
Kharagpur ,
India.
With
the
continuation
of
my
discussion
on
the
quality
estimation
of
major
pollutants,
today
I
will
be
discussing
about
how
to
determine
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand,
chemical
oxygen
demand
and
the
total
organic
carbon.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture
video,
I
will
be
covering
the
concepts
like
the
procedures,
the
conditions
and
the
factors
involved
in
conducting
biochemical
oxygen
demand
test.
The
test
and
purpose
of
determining
the
chemical
oxygen
demand
in
wastewater ,
the
potential
sources
of
interference
in
the
COD
test
and
the
determination
of
total
organic
carbon
in
water .
To
start
with
you
know
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand
is
what
it
is
it
is
nothing,
but
it
is
a
kind
of
a
quantification
of
the
biodegradable
organic
matter
present
in
your
system
say
whatever
the
sample
you
have
say
like
water
or
the
wastewater
sample.
So,
most
of
the
cases
this
biodegradable
once
can
be
easily
quantified
using
this
BOD
test
and
we
sometimes
have
to
go
for
a
COD
test
in
order
to
understand
the
presence
of
biodegradable
as
well
as
hardly
biodegradable
organic
matter
present
in
your
sample
whether
it
be
water
or
wastewater
solutions.
So,
this
is
the
basic
difference
between
the
COD
and
the
BOD
I
would
say.
So,
in
the
BOD
from
the
name
itself
you
can
understand
it
is
a
biochemical
oxygen
demand
means
some
biochemical
reaction
is
taking
place.
What
we
are
doing
we
are
simply
in
order
to
make
it
much
more
simpler
I
would
say
what
we
are
doing
we
have
a
certain
small
container
in
that
container
we
have
our
sample
solution.
In
that
sample
solution
we
purposefully
introduce
some
inoculum
some
amount
of
active
microor ganisms.
So,
those
will
consume
in
the
presence
of
oxygen
and
it
will
degrade
the
the
the
obviously ,
the
the
the
the
the
organic
matter
present
there
and
by
means
of
by
means
of
this
the
changes
in
the
dissolved
oxygen
level
we
can
easily
quantify
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand.
I
will
show
you
how
to
quantify
it
what
is
the
procedure
of
it,
but
this
is
the
basic
understanding
this
is
the
basic
ah
ideology
behind
this
biochemical
oxygen
ah
biochemical
ah
oxygen
demand
test.
So,
majorly
it
indicates
the
organic
pollution
high
BOD
level
indicates
the
presence
of
organic
pollutants
and
even
the
low
BOD
level
also
indicate
the
organic
pollutants.
However ,
if
your
like
you
know
regulatory
bodies
are
ok
with
say
like
30
ppm
or
30
milligram
per
liter
or
say
50
ppm
or
50
milligram
per
liter
of
BOD
then
it
is
perfect,
but
in
most
of
the
cases
ah
more
than
50
milligram
per
liter
in
regardless
of
the
ah
you
knowthe
regulatory
bodies
most
of
the
cases
it
is
considered
as
highly
polluted
I
mean
like
the
polluted
the
water
is
considered
as
polluted
if
the
BOD
level
is
more
than
50
milligram
per
liter
in
general.
It
also
used
ah
for
monitoring
the
environmental
health
we
can
easily
detect
the
pollution
event
all
of
a
sudden
suppose
any
ah
certain
ah
cultural
event
is
happening
and
also
like
you
know
any
slaughterhouse
waste
is
going
to
ah
in
to
the
surface
water
bodies
and
all
any
in
any
or
any
other
cases
where
people
lot
of
people
will
be
involved
at
the
same
time
and
where
or
some
ah
slaughtering
or
say
like
you
know
some
animal
ah
bodies
involved
or
some
ah
kind
of
ah
processing
industries
are
involved
in
those
cases
there
is
a
chance
of
certain
peak
in
BODs
right.
So,
this
sudden
peak
in
BOD
the
organic
matter
the
the
presence
of
organic
matter
the
more
the
organic
matter
in
the
water
water
body
the
BOD
level
will
high
right
specially
the
biodegradable
ones.
So,
this
is
what
actually
it
is
gives
us
an
indication
that
the
water
body
is
getting
polluted
with
the
because
of
the
presence
of
those
organic
matter
and
it
ah
this
BOD
BOD
value
once
we
know
the
BOD
value
it
can
actually
gives
us
an
indication
that
the
pollution
events
are
occurring
somehow
and
you
have
to
somehow
restrict
it.
It
also
helps
authorities
to
enforce
the
water
quality
standards
as
I
was
mentioning
that
different
regulatory
bodies
has
different
standards
that
they
normally
mention
they
normally
ah
give
the
notification
notice
to
the
all
the
concerned
authorities
and
industries
and
the
municipalities
that
you
have
to
maintain
this
much
of
BOD
only
you
cannot
your
end
end
ah
like
you
know
waste
water
I
would
say
like
you
know
the
effluent
or
say
like
you
know
your
dischar ge
water
has
to
be
has
to
have
the
BOD
level
of
less
than
this
then
only
you
are
allowed
to
ah
throw
it
or
allowed
to
dischar ge
it
into
the
surface
water
bodies
you
understand.
So,
this
is
the
this
is
how
the
BOD
is
important
for
ah
like
you
know
for
any
regulatory
bodies
to
understand
the
level
of
contamination
or
the
level
of
pollution
the
water
is
causing
into
the
ah
the
or
the
or
the
industry
or
the
municipality
is
causing
ah
to
the
surface
water
bodies.
It
also
gives
us
an
indication
of
the
impact
on
the
aquatic
ecosystems
because
high
BOD
means
it
will
definitely
deplete
the
dissolved
oxygen
present
in
the
water
and
it
can
be
highly
essential
for
survival
of
aquatic
life
and
so,
it
can
also
cause
what
the
eutrophication
phenomena
can
also
occur
start
occurring
ok.
There
is
a
certain
correlations
between
them
as
well.
So,
in
general
high
BOD
is
obviously ,
is
not
acceptable
and
you
we
are
trying
to
ah
like
you
know
reduce
the
BOD
level
to
a
considerable
amount.
So,
that
it
will
be
ok
for
ah
dischar ging
to
the
ah
surface
water
bodies.
So,
that
aquatic
ah
my
ecosystems
can
easily
thrive
to
that.
What
are
the
basic
purpose
of
BOD
test?
As
I
was
mentioning
the
accessing
the
water
quality
monitoring
the
pollution
and
evaluate
the
treatment
efficiency
that
is
also
very
important.
If
you
want
to
understand
that
your
ah
plant
or
say
like
whatever
the
reactor
that
you
have
designed
if
itis
working
or
not
you
need
to
understand
the
BOD
value.
Suppose
you
have
a
water
treatment
unit
or
wastewater
treatment
unit.
So,
it
is
initial
wastewater
that
is
come
into
contact
with
this
ah
tank
or
the
just
ah
in
the
goes
inside
this
tank
it
has
say
like
the
which
we
call
influent.
Suppose
the
influent
has
a
BOD
of
100
milligram
per
liter
and
after
a
certain
detention
time
when
the
water
will
pass
through
this
tank
suppose
it
has
a
BOD
of
say
50
milligram
per
liter.
What
does
it
mean?
It
means
that
particular
unit
has
an
efficiency
of
50
percent
BOD
removal.
Now
you
design
another
systems
which
can
treat
the
water
further
and
the
effluent
has
a
BOD
of
25
milligram
per
liter.
So,
that
means,
the
new
design
is
much
more
efficient
is
not
it.
So,
it
can
because
it
can
remove
75
percent
of
the
ah
BOD
is
not
it.
So,
initial
100
now
it
is
25.
So,
70
percent
75
percent
BOD
removal
can
be
ah
achieved.
So,
that
means,
the
second
system
is
more
efficient
than
the
first
one.
So,
that
is
how
we
can
easily
evaluate
the
treatment
efficiency
of
a
newly
designed
systems
or
the
existing
systems
with
a
temporal
or
the
temporal
basis.
What
are
the
procedures
and
the
conditions
in
conducting
the
BOD
test?
First
the
test
conditions
for
ideal
BOD
test
we
need
to
have
provide
them
with
a
nutrient
because
you
know
what
we
are
doing
as
I
was
mentioning
at
the
very
beginning
that
in
the
bottle
we
are
simply
putting
some
active
microor ganisms
and
sometimes
we
may
not
have
to
put
as
well
like
it
depending
upon
a
type
of
wastewater .
Sometimes
the
sanitary
waste
it
also
has
it
it
automatically
has
some
ah
microor ganisms
in
it
which
will
actually
work
on
it
and
we
do
not
have
to
additionally
seed
it
we
have
to
supply
with
the
additional
seed
or
we
call
it
seeding
actually
this
artificial
ah
like
you
know
this
inoculation
is
called
the
seeding
event
ok.
So,
for
ideal
BOD
test
nutrient
should
be
available
for
those
microor ganisms
to
survive
other
than
organic
matter .
Near
neutral
pH
the
pH
should
be
ah
maintained.
We
if
it
is
possible
you
add
some
buffer
so
that
you
do
some
pH
adjustment
before
the
BOD
test.
Absence
of
microbial
growth
inhibitor
there
should
not
be
a
lot
of
ah
heavy
metals
or
any
reactive
oxygen
species
or
any
other
consequences
or
any
ah
circumstances
work
at
which
the
the
life
or
the
those
ah
microor ganisms
which
are
their
active
microor ganisms
their
life
will
be
threatened
ok.
And
also
the
stable
temperature
if
the
temperature
will
change
definitely
the
type
of
microor ganisms
will
which
is
thriving
in
that
particular
solution
will
also
change
and
it
will
also
it
will
actually
hamper
and
give
you
the
erroneous
result.
The
sample
seeding
ah
need
for
a
mixed
group
of
microor ganisms
in
the
sample
sample
which
we
call
the
artificial
seedling
seeding.
In
case
of
ah
sanitary
sewage
we
do
not
have
to
go
for
artificial
seeding
because
it
is
like
un
un
seeded
BOD
test
is
also
enough
because
thoseah
sanitary
sewage
already
has
some
kind
of
some
kind
of
micro
some
amount
of
microor ganisms
which
can
act
as
an
inoculum
in
this
case.
The
test
duration
ah
in
general
5
days
of
incubation
is
ah
provided
at
20
degree
Celsius
it
is
like
the
standard
ah
technique.
So,
20
degree
Celsius
at
5
day
is
standard.
However
in
Indian
conditions
sometimes
we
go
for
27
degree
Celsius
for
3
days
ok.
I
will
discuss
about
it
why
we
choose
this
particular
5
day
or
3
days
of
ah
duration
which
is
quite
long
is
not
it
because,
but
just
imagine
the
organic
matter
that
is
that
you
are
supplying
that
the
your
sample
has.
So,
it
will
take
some
time
for
your
microor ganism
to
consume
it.
So,
we
take
into
consider
this
duration
like
at
we
like
you
know
for
this
duration
like
suppose
we
have
to,
but
this
this
consumption
this
process
can
can
go
on
for
20
days
30
days
and
go
and
like
infinite
time
theoretically .
However
we
have
to
have
a
standard
you
know
protocol
the
based
on
that
actually
this
5
days
of
20
degree
Celsius
ah
things
are
coming
up
and
actually
there
is
a
funny
story
also
about
it.
So,
it
says
that
you
know
in
the
early
days
in
the
I
mean
like
in
the
if
you
see
the
in
England
if
you
go
to
the
Thames
river.
So,
from
Thames
river
ah
if
you
go
like
from
any
point
of
time
when
the
water
is
actually
from
its
source
when
it
actually
ah
generates
like
you
know
in
natural
sources
it
it
will
not
take
more
than
5
days
to
reach
to
the
ocean.
So,
there
are
some
ah
prophecy
like
you
know
say
like
you
know
this
is
how
actually
ah
like
you
know
we
come
into
come
with
this
number
at
5
days
of
this
number
ok.
So,
anyway
so,
in
general
ah
ah
5
days
of
incubation
period
is
actually
maintained
ah
and
approximately
70
percent
of
the
oxygen
demand
is
to
be
satisfied
during
this
period
that
is
what
we
normally
do
if
it
is
satisfying
that
means,
our
test
procedure
the
test
duration
is
quite
ok.
The
seed
correction
sometimes
the
oxygen
demand
attributed
to
the
seed
then
the
additional
inoculum
when
you
are
adding
those
inoculums
are
also
actually
contributing
to
some
kind
of
organic
matter
they
are
they
are
biomass
body
mass
is
nothing,
but
organic
matter
ok.
When
they
will
die
that
will
also
consider
some
add
some
additional
organic
matter
to
the
system
is
not
it.
So,
in
order
to
ah
correct
this
ah
the
the
oxygen
demand
which
is
attributed
because
of
the
seed
ah
additional
artificial
seeding
we
have
to
substrate
that
value
with
the
overall
BOD
measurement
ok
that
this
called
the
BOD
corrected
which
is
equal
to
BOD
measured
minus
the
oxygen
demand
of
the
seed
or
the
blank
we
call
it
ok.
So,
what
we
do
ah
in
case
of
pH
adjustment
we
normally
add
some
buffers
and
also
the
our
pH
is
ah
neutralized
ah
which
is
preferred
for
the
biological
activity
to
take
place
and
what
are
the
different
interferences
that
can
happen
in
the
BOD
test
definitely
the
lack
of
nutrient.
If
you
do
not
add
those
nutrient
what
will
happen?
It
is
more
like
you
know
you
cannot
only
sustain
by
the
carbohydrate
you
need
to
have
a
protein,
fat,
minerals,
ah
other
ah
water
etcetera
etcetera.
But
so,
in
order
for
your
aerobic
microor ganisms
orwhatever
I
mean
like
or
the
microor ganisms
that
you
are
that
you
are
providing
to
your
system
through
sustain
they
need
then
only
need
they
not
only
need
the
organic
matter ,
but
they
also
need
some
other
heavy
metals
or
some
other
nutrients
as
well.
So,
you
need
to
provide
those
nutrients
ah
to
the
systems
as
well.
However ,
the
presence
of
additional
heavy
metals
can
also
cause
another
problem.
Some
amount
of
metal
mineral
concentration
is
ok
some
amount
of
mineral
is
ok,
but
heavy
metal
like
huge
amount
of
presence
of
heavy
metal
can
also
cause
drastic
changes
in
the
system
and
all.
Majorly
this
metals
will
start
accumulating
on
the
glass
chamber
and
all
and
also
create
a
different
kind
of
different
kind
of
habitate
for
the
microor ganisms
which
can
actually
cause
harm
to
the
systems.
And
also
it
can
oxidize
and
it
can
also
utilize
some
amount
of
additional
oxygen
and
your
actual
result
will
be
erroneous.
And
also
the
residual
chlorine
that
is
also
another
major
problem
that
can
be
easily
eliminated
actually
there
are
procedures
I
will
be
discussing
very
soon.
What
are
the
processes
and
factors
in
the
conducting
BOD
test?
First
the
oxygen
estimation.
So,
at
the
very
first
what
you
do
you
take
the
sample
you
have
a
like
300
ml
beaker
in
the
300
ml
beaker
you
take
the
initial
reading
initial
dissolved
oxygen
value.
So,
before
even
taking
the
reading
like
you
know
that
distilled
water
that
you
put
in
the
300
ml
beaker
I
mean
like
in
a
container
that
water
has
to
be
aerated
for
the
overnight.
So,
you
have
a
aeration
you
provide
aeration
to
water
aeration
means
nothing,
but
artificially
you
are
providing
the
oxygen
it
is
like
dissolved
oxygen
just
like
you
do
it
in
the
aquarium
you
have
this
diffuse
aerator
you
remember
you
know .
So,
diffuse
aerator
like
that
you
put
it
in
a
small
bucket
you
have
the
distilled
water
there
you
keep
the
aeration
device
on.
So,
with
time
what
will
happen
the
dissolved
oxygen
level
will
reach
to
almost
the
saturation
level
which
is
what
at
20
degree
Celsius
9.07
milligram
per
liter
you
know .
So,
we
try
to
reach
to
that
level
at
the
max
as
possible.
So,
next
morning
you
come
you
put
that
sample
you
put
that
distilled
water
at
a
certain
ratio
along
with
the
sample
ah
and
a
fill
it
up
at
300
ml
bottle
and
then
what
to
do
you
add
the
ah
this
ah
the
the
seed
or
say
like
you
know
unioculum,
then
you
also
add
2
ml
of
this
manganese
sulphate
sodium
hydroxide
potassium
iodide
Na
Na
Na
Na3
etcetera.
And
then
you
incubate
it
typically
for
20
degree
Celsius
for
5
days
in
a
incubation
chamber
ok.
So,
what
will
happen
with
time
those
seed
those
bacteria
those
microor ganisms
it
will
keep
on
consuming
the
organic
matter
present
in
your
waste
water
ok.
And
along
while
consuming
those
it
will
also
need
some
oxygen
because
its
aerobic
decomposition
will
take
place
is
not
it.
So,
the
changes
will
changes
in
the
dissolved
oxygen
will
occur .
So,
after
5
day
what
you
will
do
you
will
take
the
sample
and
eitheryou
do
the
put
the
DO
probe
the
DO
meter
and
with
the
DO
meter
also
you
can
directly
ah
now
a
days
you
can
do
the
calculations
that
what
is
the
final
DO
or
you
can
directly
do
the
you
can
determine
the
oxygen
demand
using
the
FANH
4
2
SO
4
2
which
this
what
and
using
the
ferro
indicator
and
with
this
you
can
once
you
know
the
final
DO
and
once
you
know
the
initial
DO
you
can
easily
find
out
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand
which
is
with
using
this
following
equations
in
the
in
milligram
per
liter.
Initial
DO
minus
final
DO
minus
1
minus
p,
p
is
nothing,
but
it
is
the
the
volume
of
the
sample
divided
with
the
total
volume
of
BOD
bottle
or
the
300
ml
that
is
the
ratio
of
like
you
know
that
you
are
mentioning
the
amount
of
waste
water
that
you
have
divided
by
the
total
volume
of
the
BOD
bottle
in
general
its
300
ml.
BOD ,=𝑚𝑔𝐿(𝐷𝑂𝑖−𝐷𝑂𝑓)−(1−𝑝)(𝐵𝑖−𝐵𝑓)
𝑝
So,
now
you
multiplied
with
the
blank
initial
ah
BOD
initial
dissolved
oxygen
or
the
DO
of
the
blank
and
the
final
DO
of
the
blank.
Blank
means
its
only
waste
water
and
then
you
add
I
mean
like
in
the
waste
water
you
just
simply
add
the
inoculum
ok.
I
mean
like
in
the
in
a
sorry
its
a
distilled
water
where
you
add
the
inoculum.
In
case
of
ah
actual
scenario
what
we
are
doing
we
are
adding
sample
plus
ah
this
distilled
water
plus
the
inoculum,
but
in
case
of
blank
it
is
only
the
distilled
water
and
there
only
you
ah
300
ml
of
distilled
water
you
add
the
inoculum
ok.
So,
only
because
of
the
inoculum
what
is
the
dissolved
oxygen
depletion
that
can
easily
be
identified
ok
and
that
can
be
easily
eliminated
also
using
this
equation.
So,
this
is
how
we
will
get
the
actual
BOD
value
within
in
5
days
we
call
it
BOD
5
ok.
So,
let
us
go
ahead
with
this
numerical
I
would
request
all
of
you
know
if
you
are
having
any
pen
or
paper
in
front
of
you
just
open
it
and
try
to
understand
the
form
ah
this
example.
While
performing
the
BOD
test
a
blank
BOD
bottle
containing
only
seeded
dilution
water
has
its
DO
level
dropped
by
1.2
milligram
per
liter
during
a
5
day
incubation.
So,
what
does
that
mean
that
this
is
the
second
scenario
this
is
the
blank
scenario
where
there
is
only
dilution
water
or
distilled
water
where
you
only
add
the
seeded
ah
sample
this
is
that
means,
and
in
your
have
a
you
add
the
inoculation
you
add
the
ah
inoculum
there
and
after
5
day
the
DO
is
dropped
by
1.2
milligram
per
liter
only
which
is
because
of
the
activity
of
the
microor ganisms
which
acts
on
its
own
biomass
I
mean
like
in
the
biomass
represented
by
ah
by
I
mean
like
the
inoculum
the
BOD
we
I
mean
like
which
is
actually
ah
ah
we
introduced
because
of
this
inoculum
ah
presence
in
the
present
in
the
system.
And
also
sample
BOD
bottle
was
filled
with
6
milliliter
of
wastewater
and
the
rest
seeded
dilution
water
what
does
that
what
does
that
mean
6
milliliter
and
total
total
volume
should
be
300
ml
as
I
was
discussing.
So,
6
milliliter
divided
by
300
ml
that
isthe
selected
dilution
fraction
or
the
p.
So,
we
can
easily
find
out
the
dilution
fraction
here
because
we
know
that
6
ml
of
wastewater
is
added
in
total
300
ml
of
bottle
BOD
bottle.
So,
what
is
the
amount
of
ah
dilution
water
300
minus
6
total
294
milliliter
of
dilution
water
plus
6
ml
of
wastewater
or
the
sample
total
300
ml
ok.
So,
6
ml
by
300
ml
we
will
get
the
dilution
factor
fraction
as
0.02
and
what
else
is
given
its
also
given
that
in
case
of
sample
bottle
the
DOD
DO
drop
is
around
5.8
milligram
per
liter
during
the
same
time
period
what
would
be
the
BOD
5
of
the
wastewater .
So,
BOD
5
will
be
the
5.8
the
DO
drop
in
the
actual
scenario
in
the
sample
wastewater
scenario
sample
bottle
minus
1.2
which
ah
which
is
the
difference
in
the
the
DO
drop
DO
level
drop
in
case
of
what
in
case
of
the
ah
the
blank
then
we
have
1
minus
0.02,
0.02
is
the
value
of
p
as
you
remember
from
this
equation
the
value
of
p
and
you
divided
by
now
you
have
to
divided
with
the
p
that
is
it.
So,
DOI
minus
DOF
is
given
5.8
and
BI
minus
BF
is
also
given
1.2
in
this
equation
is
not
it.
So,
it
is
makes
it
much
easier
then
1.2
1
minus
0.2
divided
by
0.02
you
will
get
the
value
of
BOD
5
as
a
231
milligram
per
liter
that
is
the
answer .
So,
you
can
easily
find
out
what
is
the
BOD
of
your
wastewater
you
understand.
Next
problem
in
the
next
problem
it
is
told
that
for
a
wastewater
sample
is
expected
to
have
a
BOD
5
value
of
around
300
milligram
per
liter.
So,
the
BOD
is
expected
to
be
around
300
milligram
per
liter
and
the
initial
DO
ah
of
prepared
dilution
water
is
7.8
milligram
per
liter
you
can
see
it
is
almost
near
to
what
almost
near
to
the
saturation
ah
ah
saturation
ah
concentration
of
dissolved
oxygen
in
the
water .
Now
you
are
asked
to
determine
the
dilution
requirement
for
performing
the
BOD
test.
So,
initially
when
you
are
expecting
that
your
wastewater
may
be
having
a
BOD
of
around
300
milligram
per
liter.
So,
what
should
be
the
dilution
fraction?
What
is
this
dilution
fraction?
If
you
remember
that
total
bottle
volume
is
300.
So,
what
is
the
amount
of
solution
that
should
be
what
is
the
amount
of
wastewater
that
is
should
be
added
and
the
rest
should
be
filled
up
with
the
distilled
water
or
the
dilution
water
ok.
So,
this
fraction
has
to
be
ah
your
your
requested
or
your
asked
to
find
out
what
will
be
the
this
fraction,
what
will
be
the
amount
of
this
dilution
requirement
for
performing
this
BOD
test.
So,
BOD
approximately
300
milligram
per
liter
and
the
DO
initial
is
also
known
to
us
7.8
milligram
per
liter
to
ensure
that
a
minimum
DO
of
about
ah
say
1.5
milligram
per
liter
will
remain
in
the
BOD
bottle
after
5
days
of
incubation.
So,
the
amount
of
DO
available
will
be
somehow
7.8
minus
1.5
equal
to
6.3
milligram
per
liter.
So,
even
after
5
days
say
almost
1.5
ah
the
final
DO
will
be
1.5
milligram
per
liter.
So,
what
will
be
the
DO
difference
around
6.3
milligram
per
liter.
Hence
the
dilution
will
be
required
300
milligram
per
liter
which
is
like
the
total
ah
I
mean
like
the
expected
ah
BOD
divided
by
the
ah
the
the
DO
change
in
DO.
So,
from
there
you
can
easily
get
the
P
value
isn't
it.
So,
it
is
46
point
ah
47.62.
So,
let
us
take
a
dilution
of
around
50
to
60
times.
What
does
that
mean?
It
means
like
50
times
that
means,
50
times
dilution
is
means
what
like
300
instead
of
I
mean
like
ah
once
you
have
a
you
have
a
300
ml
of
bottle
you
have
to
add
6
ml
of
wastewater
in
total
300
ml
of
ah
bottle.
So,
6
ml
divided
by
300
how
it
will
what
it
will
become
1
by
50.
So,
from
there
you
can
get
the
that
means,
50
times
dilution
is
needed
that
means,
you
have
to
have
a
6
ml
of
wastewater
and
then
294
ml
of
dilution
water
or
the
distilled
water
which
is
already
aerated
from
before
that
is
how
we
calculate
the
BOD
ok.
I
hope
you
understand
the
procedure
you
know .
So,
next
is
the
chemical
oxygen
demand.
We
will
be
discussing
more
about
this
BOD
in
the
coming
lecture
and
we
will
design
we
will
do
the
modeling
of
BOD
and
we
will
try
to
understand
more
in
details
and
its
correlation
with
COD
and
TOC,
but
before
that
I
want
you
to
understand
the
concept
first.
So,
this
is
the
next
one
next
very
important
ah
parameter
which
we
call
the
COD
or
the
chemical
oxygen
demand
ok.
Chemical
oxygen
demand
is
majorly
most
famously
used
in
most
of
the
ah
treatment
unit,
treatment
plants
all
over
the
world
because
its
precision
and
the
reproducibility
and
it
is
also
quite
easier
to
perform
than
the
BOD.
You
remember
BOD
we
need
5
day
3
day
it
is
like
longer
duration
you
cannot
do
it
in
a
regular
basis
in
a
in
your
industry
can
you
do
that
you
cannot.
So,
what
you
have
to
do
you
can
do
the
COD
test
COD
test
does
not
take
more
than
couple
of
hour
ok.
So,
what
are
the
other
ah
benefits
of
it?
It
takes
a
standardized
methods
American
Public
Health
Association
APHA
it
is
they
are
very
they
are
actually
they
made
a
very
specific
ah
characteristics
and
the
method
that
is
available
in
their
notes
and
also
the
international
organization
of
standardization.
So,
ISO
also
has
its
own
notes
available
for
the
ah
COD
method
that
has
to
be
followed
by
the
scientist
all
over
the
world
or
the
the
testing
facilities
all
over
the
world.
It
also
has
a
strict
laboratory
ah
protocols
the
precise
measurement
and
accurate
reagent
preparation
and
control
environmental
conditions
can
be
kept
whereas,
in
BOD
ah
your
inoculum
may
drastically
vary
your
performance
the
BOD
value
the
actual
the
BOD
value
that
you
will
get
out
of
it.
Because
suppose
you
are
taking
an
inoculum
from
the
nearby
water
bodies
or
definitely
there
will
be
a
very
less
amount
of
microor ganisms
present
there
at
the
same
time
suppose
you
are
taking
it
directly
from
ah
aerobic
treatment
unit
which
is
already
running.
So,
you
take
the
sludge
sample
from
the
bottom
that
is
very
activated
that
means,
there
are
huge
amount
ofmicrobes
present
there
and
there
are
there
even
the
microbes
their
ah
consumption
pattern
will
also
differ
time
to
place
to
place.
So,
all
these
things
will
give
you
a
little
bit
of
ah
range
of
BOD
values
the
actual
BOD
is
very
hard
to
get
because
it
depends
on
different
different
other
parameters
as
well.
However ,
in
COD
you
will
get
the
actual
value
because
it
has
a
very
strict
laboratory
protocols
maintains
for
maintained
for
it.
Then
it
is
also
reproducible
ah
I
mean
like
as
I
was
mentioning
also
quality
control
is
possible
because
ah
it
we
can
go
for
the
running
blank
and
also
identify
rectify
the
issues
related
to
the
related
to
the
testings.
And
the
titration
accuracy ,
B-route
calibration
ah
indicator
use
the
end
point
determination
executed
with
care
for
accuracy
and
plus
nowadays
it
becomes
much
more
easier
because
of
the
spectrophotometric
methods
those
are
available.
Sometimes
people
do
not
go
for
this
laboratory
procedures
more
like
like
ah
because
of
like
like
the
spectrophotometric
methods
are
much
more
easier
ok.
In
the
close
reflex
method
only
that
I
will
be
discussing,
but
it
is
done
now
in
spectrophotometrically
most
of
the
places
in
the
world
because
it
is
much
it
makes
it
much
easier
and
the
faster
ah
determination
and
the
accurate
result
is
possible
then
the
ah
then
the
other
titration
methods
and
all.
What
are
the
importance
of
COD
in
water
quality
assessment?
As
I
was
mentioning
BOD
gives
us
the
biodegradable
organic
matter
present
in
your
wastewater .
COD
will
give
you
almost
complete
organic
matter
present
in
a
wastewater .
Sometimes
it
may
not
be
able
to
give
the
exact
value
of
the
organic
matter
present
in
a
wastewater
if
there
are
some
very
hardly
biodegradable
organic
matter
present
like
the
cellulose
that
we
have
there
there
are
different
types
of
ah
aromatic
hydrocarbons
which
are
very
hard
to
break.
Only
in
a
very
few
cases
that
COD
would
not
be
able
to
give
you
the
exact
value
of
the
organic
matter
present
in
a
wastewater .
So,
most
of
the
cases
it
does.
So,
that
is
why
the
COD
is
more
preferable
more
ah
reproducible
and
also
it
is
more
precise
in
giving
the
organic
matter
present
in
your
wastewater
ok.
So,
the
COD
it
also
it
definitely
indicates
the
organic
pollution
in
the
water
as
I
was
mentioning.
So,
the
importance
of
organic
matter
is
obviously ,
the
pollution
you
know
the
more
if
it
is
there
and
also
the
wastewater
treatment
evolution
same
as
the
example
that
I
was
giving
you
for
ah
the
BOD
calculation.
In
the
BOD
also
if
you
know
the
initial
BOD,
if
you
know
the
final
BOD
we
can
identify
that
efficiency
of
the
treatment
plant
same
for
same
applicable
for
the
COD
also
and
even
COD
can
give
you
more
better
accuracy
of
and
showcase
you
better
understanding
about
the
treatment
efficacy
ah
once
the
COD
is
concerned
ok.
I
mean
in
in
a
treatment
plant
is
design
is
concerned.
Early
pollution
detection
ispossible
and
the
regulatory
compliances
are
also
has
to
be
maintained
as
I
was
saying
different
regulatory
bodies
has
different
limitations
and
they
have
maintained
they
standardized
and
it
has
to
be
maintained.
So,
the
COD
value
of
your
wastewater
COD
value
of
municipality
waste
wastewater
or
the
water
that
is
that
is
being
dischar ged
into
the
surface
water
body
or
the
industrial
wastewater
the
effluent
will
give
the
regulatory
body
a
free
hand
that
ok.
So,
they
are
not
maintaining
the
COD,
they
are
not
maintaining
the
ah
treatment
ah
plant
in
a
way
that
it
is
supposed
to
be
because
the
final
COD
is
more
than
what
it
is
supposed
to
be.
So,
that
means,
their
treatment
has
some
issues
some
error
some
error
something
ah
some
mishap
is
happening
some
issues
are
there
in
their
treatment
plant
you
know .
How
we
can
determine
the
COD?
There
are
open
reflux
methods
for
samples
ah
with
COD
say
like
around
50
milligram
per
liter
oxygen
per
ah
milligram
of
milligram
per
liter
or
50
ppm.
The
sample
homogenization
shaking,
stirring,
using
a
mechanical
homogenizer
for
uniform
mixture
prepare
the
reagent
sulphuric
acid
potassium
dichromate
silver
sulphate
ferrous
ammonium
sulphate
and
the
starch
indicator
is
used.
Ah
potassium
disation
procedure
potassium
dichromate
added
while
mixing
ah
until
the
green
color
is
achieved
and
then
silver
sulphate
is
also
added
as
a
catalyst
and
the
the
cooling
and
transfer
procedure
we
ah
normally
use
the
150
milliliter
of
digested
samples
and
we
normally
titrate
it
using
the
ferrous
ammonium
sulphate
which
added
to
the
titrate
and
ah
with
the
excess
potassium
dichromate
and
we
use
the
starch
indicator
for
ah
end
point
determinations.
Normally
the
color
changes
from
blue
green
to
the
wine
red
and
the
calculations
can
be
you
can
see
from
you
can
be
easily
ah
done
using
this
ah
the
the
following
equations
the
COD
in
milligram
per
liter
is
A
minus
B
multiplied
by
capital
N
800
divided
by
milliliter
of
sample
where
A
is
the
milliliter
of
ah
FANH
4
2
say
SO
4
2
2
required
ah
for
the
blank
and
the
B
is
the
ah
milliliter
of
FANH
4
2
SO
4
2
required
for
the
samples
and
N
is
the
normality
of
the
ah
of
the
solution
of
the
chemicals
ah
which
is
normally
the
0.1
normal.
𝐶𝑂𝐷,𝑚𝑔/𝐿=(𝐴−𝐵)×𝑁×800𝑚𝐿 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒
So,
this
is
the
open
reflex
method
there
are
closed
reflex
method
also
in
the
closed
reflex
methods
what
they
do
ah
the
same
almost
the
same
procedure
I
mean
like
instead
of
ah
say
initially
we
we
took
the
2
2.5
ml
of
sample
then
we
put
another
ah
2.5
ml
of
ah
potassium
dichromate
and
then
ah
we
add
3.5
ml
of
sulphuric
acid
with
the
silver
sulphate
as
a
catalyst.
So,
this
reaction
this
2.5
sample
2.5
dichro
potassium
dichromate
and
put
to
3.5
H2SO
4
with
silver
sulphate
at
catalyst
it
will
when
we
gently
shake
it
and
put
it
in
the
ah
digester
the
COD
digester
we
call
it.
In
the
COD
digester
when
it
is
ah
like
you
know
it
goes
for
say
150
degree
Celsius
to
160
degree
Celsius
for
2
hour
what
it
does
it
digest
it
do
the
complete
digestion
of
the
organic
matter
present
in
the
systems.
Then
we
can
actually
ah
do
the
spectrophotometrically
we
can
measure
the
at
600nanometer
we
try
to
measure
the
absorbance
value
and
from
that
absorbance
value
we
can
easily
quantify
with
the
existing
calibration
curve
that
what
is
the
COD
of
your
sample
ok.
It
is
very
easy
you
can
actually
follow
a
lot
of
literatures
which
are
available
ah
I
cannot
go
through
in
one
lecture
it
is
very
difficult
to
discuss
all
this
in
details,
but
you
can
easily
get
it
in
the
ah
the
close
reflex
method
using
spectrophotometric
method
is
one
of
the
best
way
one
of
the
easiest
way
of
ah
doing
it
ah
measure
the
CODs.
In
general
COD
test
measures
virtually
all
oxidizable
organic
compounds
whether
biodegradable
or
not
except
some
aromatic
compounds
which
resist
the
dichromate
oxidation
I
was
as
I
was
mentioning
and
also
COD
is
proportional
to
the
BOD
only
for
readily
soluble
organic
matter
ah
which
is
dissolved
in
the
in
the
wastewater .
If
it
is
not
if
it
is
like
the
complex
wastewater
there
is
very
hard
to
find
out
the
correlation
between
the
BOD
and
COD
ok.
Specially
if
the
organic
matter
is
present
in
a
suspended
from
under
such
situation
filter
sample
should
be
used
because
otherwise
you
cannot
justify
the
BOD
and
COD
ah
they
they
correlation
between
the
BOD
COD
and
also
the
complex
wastewater
when
it
contains
some
refractory
substances.
What
is
refractory
substances?
Everything,
but
which
is
hardly
biodegradable
substances.
For
hardly
biodegradable
substances
it
is
very
hard
for
you
to
ah
find
out
the
ah
the
correlation
between
ah
this
both
the
the
terms.
For
readily
biodegradable
waste
such
as
the
dairy
waste
which
is
ah
in
general
most
of
the
ah
you
know
the
the
organic
matter
can
be
easily
digested
and
most
of
them
are
actually
biodegradable
in
nature.
So,
in
that
case
COD
ah
to
BOD
ratio
you
can
easily
find
COD
is
general
in
generally
the
BOD
ultimate
divided
by
0.92.
The
potential
sources
of
interference
in
the
COD
test,
majorly
COD
test
encounters
the
ah
the
the
interference
likes
residual
chlorine
if
it
does
present
in
your
wastewater .
So,
we
normally
what
how
we
can
ah
minimize
it
we
add
the
mercury
sulfate
which
will
actually
ah
which
will
actually
remove
the
interfering
ah
this
chloride
ions.
Sometimes
we
do
the
blank
corrections
also
using
the
reagent
grade
ah
grade
water
or
a
sample
ah
that
does
not
contain
organic
matter .
We
do
the
ah
regular
calibration
of
the
equipment,
sample
dilution
is
also
needed
sometimes
and
use
of
standard
we
use
sometimes
standard
on
the
reference
materials
for
ah
practicing
the
ah
best
possible
way
of
ah
calculating
the
COD.
Determination
of
total
organic
carbon
is
another
which
actually
gives
us
a
direct
and
comprehensive
indicator
of
total
organic
carbon
present
in
a
content
present
in
a
wastewater .
How
we
can
do
that?
We
can
do
that
with
the
high
temperature
combustion
method
widely
used
and
which
ensures
the
accurate
measurement
of
total
organic
carbon
and
we
can
also
ah
do
it
using
the
sample
we
can
easily
do
it
by
you
know
you
know
we
first
remove
the
inorganic
carbon
by
phosphoric
acid
or
sulfuric
acid
ah
to
reduce
the
pH
ah
to
less
than
2.0.
And
then
we
homogenize
it
ensure
that
the
sample
is
well
mixed
if
it
contains
any
insolublewater
or
insoluble
matter
or
the
solids.
Then
we
purge
the
sample
in
a
purified
carbon
dioxide
free
gas
for
approximately
10
minutes
and
this
steps
removes
the
inorganic
carbon
prepare
the
sample
for
TOC
analysis.
Then
we
analyze
the
ah
sample
the
use
the
syringe
to
extract
the
prepared
sample
and
introduce
it
to
the
TOC
analyzers
and
all.
And
we
sometimes
deduct
the
procedural
blank
also
by
subtracting
the
procedural
blank
response
from
the
each
samples
analysis.
And
this
account
for
any
background
interference
or
it
actually
gives
us
the
accurate
results
when
we
actually
eliminate
this
blank
corrections
and
all.
So,
in
general
ah
in
this
particular
lecture
video
we
were
discussing
about
the
BOD
we
understood
that
what
is
BOD
is
all
about
and
how
this
biochemical
oxygen
demand
is
very
essential
ah
for
understanding
the
the
organic
nature
of
the
biodegradable
organic
nature
of
your
wastewater .
And
the
COD
gives
us
an
idea
about
the
the
all
the
organic
matter
present
most
of
the
organic
matter
present
in
your
wastewater
and
TOC
gives
us
the
complete
picture
ok.
So,
there
are
rigorous
ah
standardization
quality
control
measures
and
skill
technicians
are
needed
for
ensuring
the
COD
test.
However ,
it
gives
us
the
more
accurate
and
reliable
result
than
the
BOD
ok.
So,
we
will
discuss
about
more
in
details
about
the
BOD
modeling
the
the
the
its
relation
with
the
COD
and
the
TOCs
in
the
coming
lecture.
And
before
that
this
is
the
references
that
I
should
request
you
to
actually
you
can
I
am
requesting
you
to
go
ahead
with
this
and
before
going
to
the
next
ah
presentation
I
request
like
you
to
go
through
the
some
materials
ah
in
net
only
directly
to
understand
more
in
details
about
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand
and
the
chemical
oxygen
demand
to
go
through
some
of
the
some
additional
understanding
1
or
2
research
paper .
So,
then
it
will
be
much
easier
for
you
to
understand
in
the
coming
lectures
ok.
So,
thank
you
so
much
I
hope
you
understood
ah
this
very
important
ah
lecture
in
a
very
precise
way
because
of
the
ah
this
because
it
is
like
the
foundation
of
the
course
I
would
say
this
BOD
and
CODs
will
be
talking
about
this
BOD
COD
a
lot
ok.
So,
nice
ah
thank
you
so
much
see
you
in
the
next
video.
