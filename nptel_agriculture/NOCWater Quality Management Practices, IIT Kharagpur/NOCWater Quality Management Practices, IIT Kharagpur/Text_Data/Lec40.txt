Membrane
Bioreactor
(MBR)
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dhar
Bommig.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology ,
Kharagpur .
So,
in
this
last
lecture
of
module
8,
we
will
be
discussing
about
a
very
interesting
technology
which
we
call
membrane
bioreactor
or
MBR
in
short.
So,
the
concept
that
we
will
be
covering
in
this
particular
lecture
module,
lecture
video
are
the
type
of
different
process
description,
the
types
of
membrane
bioreactor ,
different
membrane
fouling
phenomena,
what
is
the
occurrence,
what
is
the
consequences
and
how
we
can
control
those
biofouling
phenomena,
how
we
can
mitigate
those
phenomenon
as
well.
And
we
will
also
discuss
about
the
performance
of
MBR
in
different
case
studies
happened
like
you
know
in
domestic
wastewater
treatment
systems
as
well
as
industrial
wastewater
treatment
systems.
To
start
with
a
membrane
bioreactor
or
membrane
biological
reactor
in
some
cases,
it
is
also
known
as
a
membrane
biological
reactor
in
short
MBR.
It
consists
of
a
of
an
aeration
tank
in
a
in
general
and
then
just
like
the
activated
sludge
process
which
will
be
called
as
bio
reactor
with
a
suspended
active
aerobic
microbial
sludge
for
the
oxidation
of
organic
matter
present
in
incoming
wastewater
followed
by
one
membrane
filtration
systems
ok.
So,
just
try
to
understand.
So,
first
we
have
one
activated
sludge
process,
just
like
the
same
we
have
we
designed
in
the
in
this
module
in
the
beginning
of
this
module
the
same
thing,
but
along
with
along
with
this
activated
sludge
process
where
the
microor ganisms
are
growing
in
suspension,
we
introduce
one
mechanical
filter
as
well
just
inside
the
say
aeration
tank
itself.
Otherwise
what
will
happen
in
case
of
ASP
what
we
do?
In
case
of
ASP
first
we
have
aeration
tank,
then
we
have
a
secondary
clarifier .
We
treat
the
biological
or
the
organic
matter
inside
this
aeration
tank,
then
the
effluent
goes
to
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank,
there
thus
clarification
or
the
sedimentation
occurs
we
have
to
leave
it
for
some
time
and
then
we
after
sedimentation
the
sludge
is
being
carried
out
for
the
handling
purposes
or
for
sometimes
the
return
sludge
can
also
be
come
out
to
the
aeration
tank.
And
then
from
there
from
the
effluent
we
get
rid
of
the
effluent
from
the
top
of
it
from
the
supernatant
part
of
it.
So,
in
case
of
ASP
we
have
a
aeration
tank,
then
we
have
a
separate
secondary
sedimentation
tank.
In
case
of
membrane
bioreactor
we
do
not
have
that
though
that
additional
secondary
sedimentation
tank,
we
do
not
need
that
clarifier
because
the
aeration
tank
itself
can
act
as
the
aeration
unit
plus
the
clarification
unit.Why?
Because
we
introduce
some
membrane
in
it,
some
ultrafiltration,
microfiltration
or
nanofiltration
membrane
inside
the
aeration
tank
itself
and
then
we
provide
some
vacuum
suction,
we
provide
some
pressure
like
to
let
the
water
pass
through
from
outside
in
or
inside
in
different
inside
out
different
mechanisms
are
there
by
which
we
are
collecting
the
water
fresh
water
from
the
aeration
tank
itself.
And
we
let
the
membrane
to
do
the
job
of
filtration
and
get
rid
of
all
the
suspended
solid
possibly
based
on
the
type
of
the
pore
size
of
your
membrane
and
based
on
the
type
of
membrane
that
you
are
going
to
use
and
the
pressure
that
you
are
going
to
apply
based
on
that
your
performance
will
vary,
but
in
general
the
concept
is
the
same.
Aeration
tank
inside
you
put
the
membrane,
you
have
the
aeration
anyway
the
suspended
microor ganisms
are
growing
there,
they
will
consume
the
organic
matter ,
then
you
suck
the
water
through
this
membrane
and
the
membrane
will
filter
all
the
only
the
filter
in
only
the
water
only
the
fresh
water
devoid
of
any
suspended
solid
and
all
the
rest
of
the
stuff
will
keep
on
collecting
there
only
ok.
In
general
in
secondary
clarifier
instead
of
secondary
clarifier
in
MBR
we
use
this
microfiltration
in
some
cases
ultrafiltration
or
nanofiltration
can
also
be
used.
The
membrane
module
can
be
flat
sheet
or
hollow
fibre
membrane.
What
is
a
flat
sheet?
It
is
like
you
know
it
is
like
it
is
more
like
a
flat
screen
ok.
There
will
be
a
flat
screen
like
structure
in
the
screen
itself
we
have
a
multiple
pore.
So,
because
of
this
pore
what
will
happen
when
the
suction
pressure
is
applied
from
the
top
from
certain
area.
So,
say
it
is
like
a
2
number
of
small
flat
sheets
are
you
know
attached
ok.
In
between
in
between
there
is
a
small
space
between
there
is
like
you
know
it
is
like
a
sandwich
like
structure.
So,
in
between
this
spaces
we
have
like
certain
small
small
like
you
know
fibres.
In
those
fibres
we
have
small
pore
in
inside
inside
this
in
on
the
body
of
this
this
fibres
are
made
of
a
like
a
very
tiny
tiny
pores.
So,
whenever
there
is
a
pressure
that
you
applied
from
the
vacuum
you
you
apply
you
suck
the
air
what
will
happen
the
water
will
try
to
fill
up
that
void.
So,
water
will
try
to
fill
up
that
void
and
it
will
pass
the
membrane
because
of
this
pressure
transmembrane
pressure
that
you
are
applying
and
it
will
pass
it
will
either
come
in
or
either
come
out
based
on
the
design
there
are
different
type
of
membrane
design
as
well.
So,
you
get
the
water
only
the
fresh
water
out
of
it.
So,
please
remember
one
thing
that
MBR
can
be
aerobic
as
well
as
anaerobic
as
well
ok.
In
the
beginning
as
I
was
mentioning
it
can
be
kind
of
a
ASP
like
structure
rather
it
can
be
anaerobic
filter
like
structure
as
well.
What
do
I
mean
by
anaerobic
filter?
Suppose
you
have
a
membrane
bioreactor
in
that
membrane
bioreactor
what
you
are
doing
in
the
in
the
bottom
you
are
supplying
you
there
is
no
aeration
external
means
of
aeration
ok.
There
is
only
a
tiny
tiny
bit
of
movement
in
the
some
aeration
biological
means
I
meanlike
mechanical
means
by
which
you
can
keep
on
rotating
the
surface
that
the
water
body
I
would
say
and
because
of
that
there
are
all
the
microor ganisms
will
be
in
suspension.
But
because
of
the
non
availability
of
oxygen
it
will
convert
into
it
will
actually
be
acting
as
an
anoxic
or
anaerobic
zone.
Because
it
is
acting
as
an
anaerobic
or
anoxic
zone
it
will
be
acting
like
a
anaerobic
reactor
only
and
those
anaerobic
microor ganisms
will
consume
the
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater
and
then
when
you
applied
the
pressure
through
this
membrane.
So,
then
again
the
same
same
filtering
function
will
happen.
In
case
of
effluent
quality
wise
MBR
effluent
is
far
more
superior
in
terms
of
BOD
and
suspended
soil
removal
compared
to
any
conventional
activities
sludge
process
or
conventional
anaerobic
treatment
systems
because
you
literally
filter
the
membrane
filter
the
water
inside
that
system
itself.
Performance
of
MBR
is
also
depending
on
the
sludge
volume
index
of
the
sludge
developed
because
the
biomass
is
retained
in
the
reactor
by
membrane
and
sludge
recirculation
is
not
involved.
So,
MBR
performance
is
quite
good
amount
of
like
it
is
influenced
by
the
by
the
SBI
as
well.
In
general
the
mixed
liquor
suspended
solid
concentration
maintained
in
MBR
is
higher
than
the
conventional
activated
sludge
process.
Hence
higher
volumetric
loading
rate
can
be
applied
and
so
which
will
reduce
the
required
volume
of
the
reactor
and
because
otherwise
in
for
the
same
amount
of
wastewater
to
be
treated
in
the
ASP
you
need
a
much
higher
size
reactor
ok,
but
here
thus
MLSS
can
be
easily
controlled
like
you
can
maintain
a
very
high
MLSS
value.
Due
to
the
retention
of
biomass
by
membrane
higher
SRT
is
also
provided
in
the
reactor
resulting
in
lesser
sludge
production
and
simultaneous
nitrification
denitrification
can
be
achieved
if
operated
at
lower
DO.
Higher
capital
and
maintenance
cost
for
membranes
is
involved
in
this
in
this
because
of
the
fouling
of
the
membrane
that
is
the
one
of
the
major
issues
with
the
membrane
bioreactor .
The
higher
capital
and
the
maintenance
cost
of
because
of
the
membrane
fouling
because
you
just
realize
you
have
a
membrane
this
tiny
teeny
fractions
of
flat
sheet
or
the
this
fiber
membranes,
hollow
fiber
membranes
they
are
keep
on
filtering
the
stuff
and
because
of
that
there
is
a
accumulation
of
there
is
a
chance
of
clogging
of
its
pore
from
the
outer
or
from
the
inner
side.
Because
of
the
clogging
after
a
while
it
becomes
not
usable
at
all
or
otherwise
you
have
to
do
the
back
flushing
or
you
have
to
do
some
physical
or
mechanical
means
of
operation
to
get
rid
of
those
clogged
pores
or
the
clogged
or
the
pore
areas
or
pores
of
your
membranes.
That
is
one
of
the
major
problem
that
this
phenomena
is
called
the
fouling
of
membrane
ok.
This
fouling
can
be
of
different
types
I
am
not
going
to
go
into
details
of
that,
but
this
foulings
are
actually
causing
a
major
issues
in
the
membranebioreactor
operations
and
all.
The
MBR
can
have
a
membrane
module
housed
in
the
main
aeration
tank
or
you
can
have
the
side
stream
one
also
as
you
can
see
in
this
picture.
The
membrane
module
is
placed
inside
the
aeration
tank
itself
and
the
effluent
is
collected
from
the
there
is
a
pump
is
there
this
from
this
pump
we
are
providing
some
suction
pressure,
the
water
goes
inside
the
membrane
module
we
can
collect
it
through
the
effluent.
We
can
also
do
it
placing
in
the
side
stream
conditions
the
water
will
be
pushed
through
this
membrane
module
it
is
like
you
know
that
is
where
I
was
saying
inside
out
kind
of
a
system.
And
because
of
the
pressure
positive
pressure
that
we
apply
it
will
it
will
come
out
of
this
membranes
with
only
the
water
will
come
out
and
only
the
rest
of
the
portions
can
be
easily
collected
as
a
sludge.
In
general
vacuum
of
around
50
kilo
Pascal
say
like
0.5
bar
or
0.5
around
0.5
atm
is
applied
in
the
membrane
to
draw
the
permeate
from
the
mixed
liquor
while
retaining
the
bio
solid
in
the
reactor
itself.
There
are
certain
arrangements
we
do
normally
to
minimize
the
bio
fouling
what
we
do
just
right
next
to
the
membrane
media
you
provide
the
aeration.
So,
because
of
the
aeration
it
will
keep
on
this
bubbles
will
keep
on
burst
on
the
surface
of
this
membrane
and
it
will
let
it
is
like
you
know
you
keep
on
you
know
like
you
know
heating
the
membrane
slow
like
you
know
very
with
a
very
tannity
force.
What
will
happen
because
of
that
the
clogging
phenomena
the
solid
will
not
be
able
to
you
know
enter
to
the
clogs
enter
to
this
pores
and
because
of
that
there
is
a
high
chances
of
it
will
anyway
happen
with
time.
But
you
can
just
like
you
know
literally
increase
the
longevity
of
those
membranes
by
having
this
kind
of
mitigation
technique.
You
normally
provide
by
this
diffuser
adhesion
systems
which
is
quite
famously
used
otherwise
there
are
external
there
are
different
other
chemical
and
the
mechanical
means
are
also
nowadays
people
are
working
on.
In
IIT
KGP
I
have
also
worked
on
this
kind
of
systems
where
I
provided
this
longitudinal
vibrations
and
because
of
this
vibration
it
will
it
will
because
of
this
certain
vibration
if
you
keep
on
providing
the
biosolid
will
not
get
enough
time
to
get
attached
to
the
surface
of
it.
So,
like
this
way
we
can
have
those
changes
and
this
process
design
will
also
vary
with
that.
So,
in
case
of
MLSS
in
case
of
this
MBR
the
MLSS
concentration
can
be
as
high
as
15
to
20
gram
per
liter
which
is
much
higher
than
the
conventional
ASP
which
where
we
cannot
go
for
more
than
3,

say
like
6,
5,
6
gram
per
liter
of
MLSS.
The
hydrated
range
is
8000
to
1000
to
make
the
processes
most
water
effective
cost
effective
and
depending
on
the
type
of
wastewater
treated
and
SRT
use
the
MLSS
to
MLSS
of
the
sludge
for
this
aerobic
MBR
in
the
it
can
range
from
0.7
to
0.8.
The
typical
value
of
SRT
sludge
retention
time
adapted
in
designing
MBR
is
in
the
range
of
5
to
20
days.
The
flux
rate
of
permeate
through
membrane
is
generally
in
the
range
of
600
to
1200
liter
per
meter
square
per
day.
TheOLR

in

we
use
and
the

for
the

4

with
a

of
as
low
as
0.1
to
0.4
kg

higher
F
by
M
ratio
can
also
be
used
in
practice
ok.
The
treatment
of
sewage
with
adapting
the
design
values
in
this
range
the
MBR
is
capable
of
producing
of
treated
effluent
with
a
less
than
10
milligram
per
liter
of
BOD,
COD
of
less
than
30
milligram
per
liter
and
effluent
turbidity
can
be
as
low
as
5
NTU
or
naphthal
naphthalimetric
turbidity
unit
and
all.
So,
in
general
how
the
membrane
fouling
occurs
as
I
was
discussing
that
the
biomass
present
in
the
mixed
liquor
gets
added
to
the
exterior
of
the
membrane
when
the
effluent
is
withdrawn
through
the
membrane
surfaces.
So,
most
of
this
some
of
this
microor ganisms
may
colonize
on
the
membrane
surfaces
and
start
secreting,
excreting
this
extracellular
polymeric
substances
or
EPS
we
call
it.
This
extracellular
polymeric
substances
it
actually
helps
them
it
is
like
a
it
is
like
a
adhesive.
So,
it
like
added
to
the
surface
of
the
membrane.
Also
the
final
particles
present
in
the
wastewater
also
can
enter
to
the
pore
of
the
membrane
and
you
can
block
it.
What
are
the
consequence?
Obviously ,
the
fouling
it
will
increase
the
pressure
loss
because
you
have
now
enough
to
provide
much
higher
pressure
to
maintain
the
desired
water
flux.
So,
it
will
slowly
it
will
completely
damage
the
whole
membrane
module.
What
are
the
strategies
as
I
was
mentioning?
Membrane
agitation
by
mechanical
scoring
of
the
attached
biomass
can
be
done
by
using
the
rising
air
bubbles
the
diffuse
aeration
systems.
The
membrane
can
also
be
backwashed
by
reversing
the
direction
of
flow
and
with
the
chemical
like
you
know
30
to
40
minutes
a
day
with
the
dose
of
chlorine
5
milligram
per
liter.
Once
or
once
in
3
or
6
months
the
membrane
module
can
be
cleaned
with
hypochlorite
or
the
citric
acid
solution
by
submer ging
it
in
the
separate
external
tank
you
just
take
it
out
and
submer ging
into
there.
Once
in
a
week
in
situ
cleaning
can
also
be
done
with
without
taking
the
membrane
module
out
of
the
aeration
tank
by
flushing
it
with
the
hydro
hypochlorite
solution
with
the
concentration
of
100
milligram
per
liter
for
about
45
minutes
followed
by
treated
water
back
flushing
for
about
15
minutes
to
get
rid
of
all
the
rest
over
of
the
hypochlorite
doses.
There
are
different
case
studies
that
I
can
showcase
like
where
people
have
used
the
MBR
for
domestic
wastewater
treatment
systems
like
in
the
first
case
the
urban
wastewater
treatment
systems
MBR
removed
more
than
95
percent
of
the
COD
with
effluent
COD
concentration
of
effluent
COD
concentration
of
around
400
to
870
milligram
per
liter
at
1.3
to
1.9
hour
of
HRT
only
in
an
integrated
membrane
microfiltration
operated
at
high
OLR
of
6
to
13
gram
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day.Can
you
imagine
within
1.3
to
1.9
hour
only
HRT
only
you
can
remove
95
percent
of
the
COD
of
this
load.
Primarily
treated
sewage
or
the
municipal
wastewater
of
average
effluent
value
of
425
milligram
per
liter
using
a
flash
sheet

submer ged
anaerobic

has
a
removal
efficiency
of
around
90
percentage
with
an
OLR
of
as
high
as
not
as
high
as
like
it
is
a
standard
of
1
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day
at
10
hour
of
HRT.
Removal

is
an
80.5

respectively
from
its

concentration
of
467,
40.4
and
7.3

so,
respectively .
So,
at
a
constant
HRT
of
10
hour
with
an
under
an
OLR
of
1.12
gram
of
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per

as
the
research
done
by
Liu
et
al
2010.
Landfill
leachate

is
with
synthetic
wastewater
in
anaerobic
submer ged
MBR
is
also
done
with
a
capillary

unit
which
gives
the
improved
COD

of
around
95
percentage
of

which
is
as
high
as
2800
to

and
OLR
of
2.5

per

And
another
study
done
by
Liu
et
al
2004
they
said
like
this
COD
to
ammonia
removal
efficiency
of
90
to
80
to
93

respectively
is
done
while
treating
the

with
the
average

and
1.5

You
can
see
this
success
stories
are
why
I
am
sharing
with
you
that
because
this
success
stories
tells
us
that
you
know
what
how
efficient
these
are
in
terms
of
you
know
you
know
like
you
know
in
terms
of
uses
in
the
municipal
wastewater .
Not
only
that
it
has
been
used
in
industrial
wastewater
as
well
for
treating
the
industrial
wastewater
as
well
like
aerobic
hollow
fiber
hybrid
MBR
is
used
for
treating
the
saline
wastewater
from
a
fish
canning
factory
operated
at
OLR
of
4
kg
of
COD
per
meter
cube
per
day
and
initial
COD
concentration
of
18000
milligram
per
liter.
It
reveals
the
COD
removal
efficiency
of
92
percent
within
an
HRT
of
5
days.
Same
is
happening
in
case
of
fuel
oil
and
lubricating
oil
industry
with
the
99.9
percentage
of
removal
can
be
happen
can
be
done
by
aerobic
this
MBR.
COD
and
TOC
removal
of
90
92
more
than
90
percentage
under
oil
loading
rate
of
3
to
5
kg
of
meter
cube
per
day.
It
is
done
in
different
studies.
In
studies
people
have
also
shown
that
average
removal
efficiency
of
80
percentage
of
copper ,
98
percentage
of
lead,
50
percentage
of
nickel
and
77
percentage
of
zinc
under
an
HRT
of
10
hour
10.3
hour
ispossible
from
by
using
this
MBRs
and
all.
So,
there
are
different
this
success
stories
about
this
industrial
wastewater
application
in
a
in
their
ETP.
In
discoloration
of
azo
dye
is
also
possible
this
MBRs
because
of
the
aeration
tank
which
is
present
there
it
also
consumes
the
converts
the
dye
into
some
byproducts
and
also
then,
but
in
this
particular
case
they
have
used
the
anaerobic
flat
sheet
MBR.
So,
they
have
used
some
anaerobic
flat
sheet
MBR
and
this
anaerobic
reactor
is
actually
responsible
for
decolorization
of
this
azo
dye.
The
textile
wastewater
in
the
olive
mill
wastewater
treatment
system
also
there
are
there
are
existing
literatures
available
where
people
have
already
tried
this
MBR
and
they
got
a
quite
good
amount
of
success.
So,
this
is
one
of
the
very
advance
like
you
know
type
of
I
mean
like
in
the
wastewater
treatment
systems
I
would
say
and
which
has
a
quite
a
good
amount
of
potential
in
near
life.
I
would
say
not
forget
about
near
life
it
is
actually
being
used
all
over
world
and
different
industries
and
municipality
as
the
case
studies
as
I
have
shown.
And
there
are
still
researches
going
on
to
improve
further
the
mitigation
capacity
of
this
membrane.
So,
that
this
membranes
can
be
like
you
know
that
the
cost
effectiveness
can
be
provided
in
this
type
of
systems
because
the
membrane
can
last
for
long
if
you
have
a
very
advance
mitigation
like
you
know
techniques.
It
membrane
this
MBRs
are
also
been
used
in
pharmaceutical,
brewery ,
food
processing
industries
as
well.
And
this
discussion
gives
us
a
very
good
overview
about
the
membrane
bioreactor
and
how
this
membrane
bioreactors
are
you
know
what
are
the
major
issues
that
we
are
having
as
of
now.
The
major
issue
is
like
the
as
I
was
mentioning
the
bio
falling.
So,
if
you
can
somehow
deal
if
you
can
somehow
if
you
are
researcher
if
you
actually
think
about
doing
a
research
on
the
in
this
kind
of
field.
This
is
a
very
important
field
that
we
can
actually
work
on.
There
are
people
who
can
work
in
this
field
and
they
can
find
out
the
solutions
possible
to
get
rid
of
the
bio
falling
phenomena
happening
in
the
membrane
bioreactor
ok.
So,
perfect
so,
we
I
would
suggest
you
to
go
through
this
go
through
with
this
references
and
get
to
know
about
more
in
details.
And
simply
you
search
for
this
papers
these
papers
will
give
you
more
in
depth
knowledge
in
depth
idea
about
how
the
membrane
bioreactor
perform
ok.
And
you
can
also
search
for
it
in
online
platform
only
in
Google
only
you
will
see
a
lot
of
videos
and
all
it
will
give
you
a
much
better
idea
when
concept
about
like
how
it
actually
works.
And
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
actually
you
know
replicate
and
it
will
definitely
engrave
in
your
brain
much
more
easily
after
wise
if
you
just
go
through.
There
are
some
more
literatures
you
can
go
through
it.So,
this
is
it
for
today
for
this
module.
I
will
see
you
in
the
next
module.
Thank
you
so
much.
