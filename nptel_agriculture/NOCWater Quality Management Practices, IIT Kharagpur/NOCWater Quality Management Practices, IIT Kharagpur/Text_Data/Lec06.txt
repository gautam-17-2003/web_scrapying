Collection
and
Preservation
of
Samples
and
the
Measurement
of
pH,
Acidity , 
Alkalinity
 
Welcome
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality 
Management 
Practices. 
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gourav
Dhar
Bhowmick. 
I
am
from 
the
Department
of
Agricultural
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology , 
Kharagpur ,
India. 
So,
welcome
to
the
second
module. 
In
this
particular
module,
we
will
be 
majorly
discussing
about
the
quantity
estimation
of 
major
pollutants
starting
with
the
lecture 
1
on
the
collection
and
preservation
of
samples 
and
the
measurement
of
pH,
acidity
and 
alkalinity . 
If
you
see
the
concept
that
I
will
be
covering
majorly
in
this
lecture
module
in
this 
particular 
lecture
video
is
the
types,
quantity
and
the
preservation
of
sample.
 
The
quality
control
and
the
result
expression
and
the
measurement
of
pH,
acidity
and
the 
alkalinity . 
As
you
already
know
that
whenever
we
talk
about
the
wastewater
treatment 
scenario
or 
the
wastewater
treatment
or
wastewater
or
water
whatever
it
is
before
even
going 
ead 
with
designing
the
plant
or
before
even
going
ead
with
the
necessity
of
treatment
that 
it 
requires,
we
first
need
to
understand
that
what
are
the
different
pollutants
or 
what
are
the 
different
what
are
the
characteristics
of
the
water
or
the
sample
or
the
wastewater 
that
we
are 
talking
about,
what
are
the
characteristic
of
it
like
physical
or
chemical
characteristics 
of 
those. 
In
order
to
understand
that
physical
or
chemical
or
the
biological
characteristics
of 
those, 
what
we
need
to
do? 
We
need
to
take
the
do
the
sampling. 
So,
there
are
scientific 
ways
of
doing
this
sampling
procedure.
 
We
cannot
just
simply
go
and
take
the
sample
from
anywhere
and
we
can
consider
it
as
. 
So,
we
have
the
samples
let
us
do
the
analysis. 
We
first
need
to
understand
the
scientific
way 
of
collecting
the
sample
from
the
sources. 
It
can
be
municipal
source,
it
can
be
industrial 
source,
it
can
be
surface
water
body
from 
where
the
water
is
actually
coming
to
you
your 
your
glass. 
So,
whatever
it
is
so,
you
just
need
to
understand
that
what
are
the
different
type 
processes 
scientific
way
of
collecting
the
sample
whenever
we
will
be
doing
some
analysis 
for
the
treatment 
plant
design
or
for
say
like
any
other
purposes.
 
In
general
what
are
the
objectives
of
sample
collection? 
Major
objectives
are
to
collect
in
a 
small
volume
of
water
or
the
wastewater
that
is 
convenient
enough
to
be
transported
back
to 
the
lab
right
or
the
testing
facility
that 
has
to
be
our
prior
considerations
that
it
has
to
be 
small
enough
just
optimal
amount. 
So,
that
we
can
easily
carry
to
our
lab
facilities
or
the
or 
the
testing
facilities. 
It
the
small
volume
of
water
which
the
sample
that
is
collected
it
has
to 
be
accurate
enough 
to
represent
the
larger
volume
of
the
sample
or
the
testing
site
from 
where
it
is
being 
sampled
that
is
very
important
that
your
sample
has
to
be
representative 
sample. 
It
cannot
be
some
random
sample
it
has
to
be
representative
to
the
criteria
for
which 
you
are
actually
using
for
at
the
for
the
place
for
the
space
or
for
the
locality
or 
for
the
like 
the
water
body
for
which
you
are
actually
using
for. 
The
sample
must
be
handled
carefully
to 
prevent
any
compositional
changes
before
performing 
the
test.
 
This
is
the
most
important
point
that
whenever
you
will
be
carrying
the
water
or
the
water 
wastewater
sample
from
the
source
to
the
laboratory
facility
or
select
testing
facility
you 
have 
to
make
sure
it
it
does
not
change
its
compositions. 
Compositions
in
term
in
terms
of 
its
say
like
its
physical
compositions,
chemical 
compositions,
biological
compositions 
whatever
it
is
it
should
not
be
changed. 
How
we
can
make
sure
that
it
will
not
change
that
isthat
is
why
the
there
is
the
picture 
of
the
scientific
sampling
thing
is
coming
in
coming
. 
So,
we
need
to
be
sure
that
the
sampling
procedure
is
scientific
enough. 
In
general
what
we 
do
we
suppose
here
take
a
container
glass
container
or
in
like
plastic 
container
also
we
can 
take
in
case
it
is
not
available
glass
container
we
just
go
there 
we
will
rinse
the
container
2
3 
times
with
the
sample
itself.
 
So,
that
it
will
not
be
having
any
kind
of
foreign
particles
present
inside
of
it. 
After
rinsing 
then
we
take
the
sample
once
the
representative
sample
is
collected
we 
normally
have
to 
label
it
with
a
tag
it
is
very
important
the
labeling
is
very
important. 
So,
that
you
will
not 
forget
that
the
where
actually
you
to
the
sample
from. 
So,
when
we
talk
about
the
labeling
it 
can
be
with
the
number
it
can
be
with
the
lat 
long
or
the
latitude
longitude
it
can
be
with
the 
the
time
it
can
be
with
the
sampling
number 
or
the
place
or
the
it
is
altitude
or
it
is
the
the
it 
is
particular
control 
lining
numbering
if
you
have
done. 
So,
in
this
in
this
case
control
lining 
numbers.
 
So,
there
are
different
things
can
be
done. 
So,
at
different
places
so,
we
normally
use
the 
same
fundamentals
can 
be
utilized
for
other
sampling
procedures
as
well,
but
basically
we 
are
talking
about 
here
the
water
samples. 
So,
after
you
put
the
label
or
the
say
like
the
tag 
on
the
top
of
it
what
we
need
to 
do
we
need
to
be
make
we
need
to
make
sure
that
the
lines 
should
be
flushed
sufficiently 
to
ensure
that
it
is
a
representative
sample. 
So,
now,
when
we 
talk
about
the
types
of
sampling
the
first
thing
come
into
our
mind
is
the 
grab
sampling
or 
the
catch
sampling. 
What
is
the
grab
sampling? 
The
grab
sampling
is
nothing,
but
the
the
it 
is
collected
when
you
go
to
a
certain
place 
of
your
concern
or
the
source
you
just
simply
take 
the
sample
in
a
bottle
at
a
particular 
time
and
a
particular
place.
 
It
should
represent
the
composition
of
the
source
at
that
time
and
at
that
place
of
the 
sampling
. 
So,
this
is
called
the
grab
sampling. 
So,
grab
sampling
is
done
when
the 
wastewater
quality
is
known
to
be
fairly
constant
in 
composition
over
a
considerable
period 
in
all
direction,
then
only
we
will
go
for
grab 
sampling. 
In
case
of
variations
in
quality
and 
the
flow
with
time
the
sampling
at
intervals
or
separate 
analysis
is
useful. 
We
will
discuss 
about
it
why
we
need
to
do
this
sampling
in
interval
and
what
is
it
called 
which
is
different.
 
So,
in
general
individual
sampling
when
we
go
for
this
kind
of
setup
we
go
we
call
it 
grab 
sampling. 
What
is
the
composite
sampling
then? 
It
is
a
mixture
of
grab
sampling
from
a 
same
sampling
point
at
a
different
times
of
the 
day
as
I
was
mentioning. 
From
the
same 
point
you
are
doing
it
at
a
different
times
of
the
day
at
the
different 
at
a
certain
interval. 
This 
is
called
the
composite
sampling. 
This
is
normally
used
in
observing
the
average 
concentration
and
estimating
the
organic
loading 
or
the
efficiency
of
a
wastewater
treatment 
unit.
 
How
it
is
possible? 
Just
imagine
you
have
a
treatment
plant. 
There
is
a
wastewater
coming 
with
say
like
200
milligram
per
liter
of
BOD. 
Your
plant
is
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
can 
treat
up
to
75
percentage
of
the
BOD 
in
it. 
However ,
with
time
how
we
can
be
sure
about 
it? 
Whenever
the
effluent
line
whatever
the
effluent
line
is
there
you
go
there
and
you
take 
the 
sampling
from
the
from
the
supernatant
point
where
it
is
actually
going
out
of
the
system 
or
you
can
get
it
collected
from
outside
also. 
So,
this
is
like
with
time
at
different
time 
interval
you
collect
that
effluent
and
you 
check
the
BOD
value
and
you
have
to
be
in
order
to 
make
sure
that
your
treatment
plant 
is
actually
treating
the
75
percent
of
the
BOD.
 
If
you
check
that
in
the
final
BOD
is
always
say
like
50
milligram
per
liter
so
that
means, from
200
milligram
per
liter
it
becomes
always
50
milligram
per
liter
that
means,
75
percent 
removal
efficiency
can
be
witnessed
from
your
design. 
So,
in
order
to
make
sure
the 
efficiency
of
a
wastewater
treatment
unit
you
have
to
do 
the
you
can
do
the
composite 
sampling
. 
There
is
another
type
of
sampling
called
integrated
sampling. 
Integrated 
sampling
when
you
are
not
sure
that
the
pollutant
composition
all
over
the 
source
is
same. 
So,
at
the
same
time
you
take
sample
from
different
places
.
 
So,
when
you
take
the
sample
from
different
points
at
the
same
time
it
is
called
the 
integrated 
sampling. 
In
this
integrated
sampling
mostly
it
is
a
fairly
constant
in
composition 
over
a
considerable 
period
in
all
direction
you
consider
and
also
the
you
have
to
have
a
prior 
knowledge
about 
the
volume,
movement
and
the
composition
of
the
various
parts
of
the 
water
which
is
to 
be
sampled
and
it
is
it
is
very
much
necessary
for
you
to
understand
that
. 
So,
what
is
the
quality? 
We
discussed
about
the
three
type
of
sampling
grab
sampling, 
composite
sampling
and
the 
integrated
sampling. 
So,
what
about
the
sample
quality? 
In 
general
2
to
3
litre
sample
volume
is
sufficient
for
general
chemical
analysis. 
However ,
you 
have
to
make
sure
the
same
sample
you
are
not
supposed
to
use
it
for
chemical, 
bacteriological
or
microscopic
examinations
as
the
collection
handling
and
preservation 
techniques
and
the
methods
will
be
different
for
all
of
them.
 
Sample
preservation
techniques. 
So,
once
you
done
with
the
sampling
you
need
to
preserve 
it
right. 
So,
there
are
different
preservation
techniques
which
are
available. 
In
general 
preservation
techniques
it
takes
care
of
the
chemical
and
the
biological
changes 
that
continue 
after
the
sample
is
collected
from
the
source. 
Different
ions
of
aluminum,
cadmium, 
chromium,
copper ,
iron,
lead,
manganese,
silver
and 
zinc
are
subject
to
be
lost
in
adsorption 
on
the
walls
of
this
glass
container .
 
How
we
can
get
rid
of
that
phenomena? 
How
we
can
get
rid
of
this
issue? 
So,
we
normally 
like
collect
the
samples
at
different
screen
bottles
and 
we
acidified
it
using
the
concentrated 
hydrochloric
or
the
nitric
acid
to
a
pH
below
2.0
to
minimize 
the
precipitation
and
adsorption 
on
the
glass
walls
. 
This
is
one
way
of
troubleshooting
this
issue. 
Other
than
that
the 
temperature,
pH,
concentration
of
dissolved
gas
also
change
in
a
very
short 
duration
after
the 
storage.
 
So,
we
cannot. 
So,
it
is
very
important
if
you
want
to
take
the
sample,
take
the
reading
for 
temperature, 
pH
and
the
concentration
of
dissolved
gas
you
have
to
do
it
in
situ
. 
Colour 
order
turbidity
it
may
also
increase
and
decrease
with
the
presence
of
sulphite, 
sulphite, 
ferrous
ions,
iodide,
cyanide
which
may
lost
through
the
oxidation
process. 
So,
colour
order 
and
turbidity
has
to
be
done
within
a
hour
or
so,
it
is
better
or
possibly 
on
that
place
itself
. 
Then
the
dependability
of
the
water
analysis
also
must
relying
on
the
experience 
and
the 
judgment
by
the
analyst
also
that
is
also
very
important
. 
So,
it
comes
with
an
experience.
 
Normally
our
standard
procedure
is
we
normally
keep
it
in
a
freezer
say
at
low
temperature 
on
4
degree
Celsius
one
of
the
best
way
to
preserve
most
of
the
qualities
of
the
sample 
until 
the
next
day. 
If
you
have
some
you
add
some
preservatives
it
would
be
better . 
So,
the
even 
though
preservatives
are
there,
but
still
I
think
like
it
is
better
to 
as
I
mentioned
the
all
the 
pH
temperature
dissolved
or
dissolved
gases
and
all
you
can 
do
it
in
situ. 
And
preservation 
methods
majorly
the
pH
control
the
chemical
addition
refrigeration
the
freezing 
are
most 
suitable. 
So,
that
you
can
extend
the
period
of
testing
time.
 
So,
suppose
your
testing
will
start
from
the
next
day. 
So,
to
somehow
make
the
sampleready
or
still
available
or
still
utilizable 
for
whatever
the
test
that
will
be
doing
in
the
next 
day. 
Majorly
for
determining
the
acidity
and
alkalinity
the
sample
can
be
stored
up
to
24 
hour
not 
more
than
that
for
BOD
within
6
hour
you
have
to
do
the
experiment. 
And
for
that 
6
hour
also
you
have
to
keep
the
sample
in
a
refrigerated
condition
why? 
Because
the 
organic
decomposition
will
start
taking
place
biological
decomposition
of
the 
all
the
all
the 
organic
matter . 
So,
once
this
biological
decomposition
of
the
organic
matter
will
start
taking 
place 
that
the
actual
BOD
value
will
be
differing
to
the
BOD
value
that
will
be
tested
or
the 
analyzed
.
 
So,
this
is
the
reason
why
you
tend
to
be
doing
it
within
6
hours
of
its
collection. 
Analysis 
of
temperature
and
pH
I
told
you
it
should
be
done
immediately
of
during 
the
sample 
collection
itself. 
And
how
we
can
still
maintain
the
quality
and
the
how
we
express
the 
results? 
Normally
we
maintain
the
stipulated
quality
of
analysis
in
the
laboratory
which 
should 
be
represents
the
true
quality
of
the
water
samples
that
is
being
analyzed. 
And
how 
we
can
achieve
this
by
definitely
employing
a
trained
and
experienced
manpower 
or
the 
analyst
should
be
very
good
and
well
trained
and
experienced
using
a
good
equipment 
facilities
differ
with
different
equipment
with
a
more
erroneous
result
can
also
be
 
generated 
and
which
can
actually
drastically
reduces
the
like
the
actual
how
say 
like
the
performance 
result
that
you
are
experiencing
to
the
actual
performance 
that
is
actually
being
experienced 
in
the
in
the
reactor
itself
and
whatever
the
results 
will
be
getting
will
differ
like
anything.
 
So,
this
is
not
acceptable. 
You
need
to
properly
calibrate
the
instrument
whatever
if
possible 
more
frequently
as
frequently 
as
possible
like
based
on
the
type
of
instrument
using
the 
certified
reagent 
and
standard
do
not
try
to
use
something
of
low
cost
and
also
like
just
to 
go
ead
with
some
random
chemicals
and
all
you
do
not
add
it
and
at
the
end
you
will 
end
up 
losing
important
samples
and
which
sometimes
may
take
may
be
very
costly . 
There
should 
be
an
interim
quality
control
program
which
is
to
be
carried
out
in
routine 
basis
at
least
once 
in
a
while
to
analysis
of
unknown
samples. 
Quality
of
the
laboratory
to
produce
acceptable 
results
should
be
analyzed
and
with
by
referencing 
the
results
from
the
external
agencies
also 
to
do
some
kind
of
a
validation
of 
your
study
or
validation
of
your
results. 
The
unit
should 
be
expressed
in
any
kind
of
analytical
results
should
be
in
milligram 
per
liter
in
general
we 
do
it
most
of
the
pollutant
present
in
the
water
or
the
waste 
water
is
normally
being 
expressed
in
the
terms
of
milligram
per
liter
or
parts
per
million 
which
is
also
equivalent
to 
milligram
per
liter
or
milligram
per
microgram
per
liter 
or
say
like
percent
when
the 
concentration
is
greater
than
10,000
milligram
per
liter. 
Milli
equivalent
per
liter
is
also
quite 
famous.
 
So,
next
is
the
pH. 
So,
first
water
I
would
say
like
characteristics
that
we
will
discuss
is
the 
pH. 
The
pH
of
the
water
or
pH
is
majorly
measured
based
on
the
water
acid
and
base 
equilibrium 
achieved
by
various
dissolved
compounds
mostly
controlled
by
the
carbon 
dioxide
bicarbonate 
and
the
carbonate
present
in
the
system
and
it
makes
it
is
a
it
normally 
stays
in
its 
equilibrium
conditions
and
actually
presents
the
this
the
the
the
the
the
way
it
like 
you 
know
represents
the
where
the
majorly
the
pH
when
we
represent
it
is
nothing,
but
it 
is 
a
negative
logarithm
of
the
hydrogen
ion
activity
present
in
your
waste
water
or
the 
water . 
When
we
do
this
acid
based
neutralization
or
water
softening
precipitation
coagulation 
and 
disinfection
or
say
like
corrosion
control
process
the
pH
really
plays
in
a
and
very 
a
very 
important
role
there
and
in
the
dilute
solutions
this
hydrogen
ion
activity
is
approximately 
equal
to
the
hydrogen
ion
concentration
and
we
need
to
remember
that
the
pH
of
the
raw 
water
sources
should
lie
between
6.5
to
8.5
due
to
the
presence
of
the
bicarbonate
and 
carbonate
of
the
alkaline
earth
salts
and
all. 
So,
majorly
when
we
measure
it
for
potentiometrically
we
use
the
indicating
electrode
or
the 
glass 
electrode
with
the
reference
electrode
with
the
standard
buffer
to
get
the
actual
value 
of
pH
for
our
sample. 
Other
than
that
earlier
days
we
use
the
litmus
also
for
understanding 
the
pH
value
of
the 
water
or
waste
water
samples
even
now
it
is
also
pH
it
is
like
more
of
a 
crude
method, 
but
now
this
potentiometric
methods
are
more
accurate
in
in
nature
you
can 
get
up
to
the
couple
of
decimal
points
also
based
on
the
type
of
potential
type
of
you 
know 
pH
meter
that
you
have
pH
probe
you
have. 
Normally
this
electrodes
we
what
we
do
this
we 
by
this
electrodes
we
electrodes
normally 
we
after
removing
the
storage
solution
we
rinse
it 
with
the
distilled
water
and
dried 
it
with
the
blotting
paper
and
then
the
instrument
is
needs 
to
be
calibrated
with
the
electrodes 
in
the
buffer
solution. 
What
we
do
we
put
the
electrode 
once
the
electrodes
are
like
we
should
be
removed
with 
time
to
time
after
the
treatment
is 
done
and
then
rinse
it
properly
and
blot
it
dry
and 
they
immersed
in
a
second
buffer
below 
the
10
pH
level.
 
The
reading
should
be
within
0.1
units
for
the
pH
of
the
second
buffer
and
then
the
same 
for
sampling
for
actual
sample
analysis
we
have
to
establish
equilibrium
between
the 
electrode
and
the
sample
by
stirring
the
sample
to
ensure
that
the
homogeneity
is
actually 
maintained
when
we
will
be
measuring
the
pH. 
In
general
nowadays
those
instruments
are 
they
are
coming
with
the
self
calibration 
processes
and
all
in
general
they
actually
comes 
with
a
very
quite
they
give
us
a
very 
precise
result. 
Then
there
comes
the
measurement
of 
acidity ,
the
acidity
contributes
to
the
corrosiveness 
or
the
influence
the
chemical
reaction 
rates
or
the
chemical
specialization
or
the
biological 
processes. 
The
strong
mineral
acids
or 
the
weak
acids
such
as
carbolic
acid,
carbonic
acid
and
acetic 
acid
and
the
hydrolyzing
salts 
such
as
the
iron
or
aluminum
sulfates
it
contributes
majorly 
contributes
to
the
acidity . 
If
you 
can
easily
understand
when
we
talk
about
the
acidity
it
means
the
pH
of
the
solution 
is
less 
than
7
right.
 
So,
there
the
presence
of
different
dissolved
oxygen,
carbon
dioxide
and
all
should
be 
handled 
clear
fully. 
So,
to
prevent
the
loss
of
dissolved
gases
when
suppose
when
we
carry 
the
sample
from 
its
sources
to
the
to
our
laboratory . 
We
have
to
also
make
sure
that
this
the 
whenever
we
will
be
doing
this
analysis 
pH
analysis
and
all
that
it
is
the
concentration 
majorly
it
would
be
better
if 
we
do
it
in
in
situ
and
we
can
just
take
our
what
is
it
called
this 
portable
pH
meter
there 
itself
and
we
can
do
it
the
sampling
there
itself. 
And
then
when
we 
talk
about
the
acidity
in
the
sampling
which
are
containing
the
carbon 
dioxide,
bicarbonate 
and
the
carbonates
it
titration
value
pH
of
8.3
at
25
degree
Celsius. 
It
majorly
gives
you
a 
understanding
about
the
weak
acids
that
is
present
in
the
system 
and
if
it
goes
if
you
want
to 
make
sure
that
you
to
know
the
what
the
amount
of
how
like 
how
much
acidic
is
it
is
like 
and
if
it
is
more
than
say
like
if
it
is
less
than
say 
like
3.7. 
Then
we
go
ead
with
the
methyl 
orange
acidity
present
with
the
presence
of
bromophenol
blue 
is
blue
this
chemical. 
So, 
major
interference
so,
dissolved
oxygen
dissolved
gas
which
is
contributed
to
acidity 
and 
liquidity
such
as
carbon
dioxide,
hydrogen
sulfide,
ammonia
it
may
be
lost
or
gain
during 
the 
storage
sampling
or
the
titration
procedure.
 
So,
we
have
to
be
very
cautious
about
that. 
So,
which
can
actually
drastically
change
the 
acidity
value
of
its
actual
one
that
that 
is
suppose
supposed
to
be
there. 
This
losses
can
be 
minimized
by
titrating
to
the
end
point
and
avoiding
vigorous
shaking 
or
protecting
the 
sample
from
the
atmosphere
for
like
during
the
titration. 
And
also
occasionally
cleaning
the 
glass
silo
to
prevent
the
coating
of
oily
matter
suspended 
solid
or
precipitates
etcetera
which 
may
create
the
sluggish
responses. 
And
do
not
use
the
indicator
titration
with
the
colored
ortarbit
samples
that
may
also 
obscure
the
color
change
at
the
end
point
and
you
may
end
up 
getting
some
erroneous 
result. 
The
procedure
selection
in
general
that
we
do
the
titration
in 
the
room
temperature
using 
a
properly
calibrated
pH
meter
and
electrically
operated
titrator 
and
the
color
indicator .
 
We
determine
the
sample
acidity
from
the
volume
of
standard
alkali
required
to
titrate
a 
portion 
of
a
pH
at
8.3
phenolphthalein
acidity
what
we
call
and
3.7
which
we
call
methyl 
orange 
acidity
. 
So,
sample
size
in
general
20
ml
or
more
would
be
better
we
take
sufficient 
large
amount 
of
this
titrate
and
then
the
samples
are
and
having
this
acidity
is
less
than
1000 
milligram 
per
liter
of
calcium
carbonate. 
We
select
a
volume
of
around
50
of
with
less
than 
50
milligram
of
calcium
carbonate
equivalent 
acidity
and
titrate
it
with
0.02
normal
sodium 
hydroxide. 
While
we
assure
that
the
it
will
be
the
acidity
will
be
more
than
1000
milligram 
then
we
do 
the
acidity
equivalent
test
with
the
less
than
250
milligram
of
calcium
carbonate 
and 
titrate
it
with
the
0.1
normal
of
sodium
hydroxide. 
After
the
titration
of
this
acidity
is 
done
we
this
the
acidity
value
of
this
water
sample 
water
whatever
it
is
water
or
waste
water 
sample
can
be
easily
expressed
using
this 
equation
in
milligram. 
Majorly
the
value
will
get
it
in
a
unit
of
CaCO
3
/L
=
,
where
A 
is
the
ml
of
NaOH
titrant
used
and
B(𝐴×𝐵)−(𝐶×𝐷)×50000𝑚𝐿 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 
is
the
normality
of
that
sodium
hydroxide
and
C
is 
the
milliliter
of
sulphuric
acid
and
D
is 
the
normality
of
the
sulphuric
acid
and
if 
acid
is
added
for
the
preserving
samples
and
all. 
Alkalinity ,
alkalinity
is
another
important
factor
this
acid
neutralizing
capacity
of 
water
can 
be
easily
find
out
using
the
alkalinity
and
also
this
acidity
and
alkalinity
is
very 
important 
when
we
have
to
make
sure
that
certain
type
of
reactions
has
to
take
place
in
your 
reactor 
and
you
have
to
maintain
the
certain
alkalinity
or
acidity
using
some
pH
buffer 
and
all.
 
So,
this
is
a
very
important
parameter
that
we
need
to
understand. 
In
general
it
gives
us
an 
measure
of
the
aggregate
of
all
the
titratable
bases
present
in
the 
water
and
can
be
easily 
interpreted
in
terms
of
specific
substances
only
when
the
chemical 
composition
of
the 
sample
is
known. 
The
alkalinity
is
primarily
because
of
the
function
of
carbonate 
bicarbonate
and
the 
hydroxide
content
and
it
is
taken
as
a
indication
of
the
concentration
of 
this
all
this
constituents. 
When
alkalinity
is
due
to
the
carbonate
or
bicarbonate
the
pH 
equivalence
point
of
the 
titration
is
determined
by
the
carbon
dioxide
concentration
at
that 
stage. 
But
the
at
that
time
the
colour
changes
by
this
metacrystalline
purple
at
the
pH
of
8.3 
and
bromocrystalline
green
or
the
methyl
orange
and
4.5
it
make
thus
indicator
suitable
for 
alkalinity
titration. 
What
are
the
procedures? 
In
general
we
use
the
colour
indicators
that 
may
be
used
for
routine
or
control
titrations 
without
interfering
the
colour
or
turbidity . 
The 
sample
size
of
around
50
25
to
50
ml
of
titrate
we
normally
use
and
we
in
case
of 
low 
alkalinity
method
we
titrate
it
with
200
ml
of
sample
with
0.02
normal
sulphuric
acid 
from
a 
10
ml
burette. 
And
standard
sulphuric
acid
or
hydrochloric
acid
of
0.02
normal
is
used
for
titration 
and
the
alkalinity
can
be
estimated
as
a
milligram
of
CaCO
3
/L
=
which𝐴×𝑁×50000𝑚𝐿 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 
is
A
is
nothing,
but
the
volume 
of
the
standard
acid
that
we
used
and
n
is
the
normality
of 
that
standard
acid
. 
So,
in
conclusion
we
we
did
a
proper
we
understood
that
what
are
the 
necessity 
of
the
proper
sample
collection
and
why
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
 
do
the 
sample
collection
in
a
very
precise
scientific
manner
otherwise
we
may
end
up 
having
some 
erroneous
result
unnecessarily . 
Because
suppose
we
are
trying
to
get
some
sample
and
we
try 
to
test
it
for
say
like 
BOD
or
COD
something
else
and
we
forget
to
keep
it
we
keep
it
in
our 
back
side 
of
your
trunk
or
say
like
our
car
and
we
keep
it
for
couple
of
hour
and
we
once 
we
come
to
our
lab
by
that
time
with
say
like
it
is
more
than
6
7
8
hours
by
that
time
it 
will 
be
enough
time
for
the
biological
or
the
the
organic
matter
present
there
which 
should
start 
degrading
biologically . 
So,
it
may
reduce
the
actual
BOD
value
or
actual
COD
value
it
can
itmay
drastically 
change
because
of
the
considered
vigorous
shaking
and
all
it
may 
considerably
change 
the
acidity
value
of
your
sample
it
will
change
the
pH
because
of
that 
in
case 
at
the
end
you
will
see
something
very
like
the
results
which
are
not
actually 
resembling 
to
the
one
that
should
be
there
in
the
real
cases.
 
And
we
also
discuss
about
the
preservation
techniques
to
safeguard
ourselves
with
that 
we 
discuss
about
how
we
can
actually
control
the
pH
we
can
do
the
temperature
control
there 
itself
we
can
carry
some
ice
bags
during
the
sample
collection. 
And
we
most
of
the 
experiments
which
can
be
done
in
situ
which
should
be
doing
in
the 
in
situ
itself
and
some
of 
the
some
of
the
cases
in
like
mineral
mineral
adsorption 
and
all
on
the
glass
bottle
in
order 
to
reduce
it
we
can
use
the
hydrochloric
acid
or
say 
at
a
certain
pH
and
only
less
than
2
pH 
and
all
will
be
better
and
a
couple
of
drops 
should
be
provided. 
So,
that
it
will
not
let
it 
how
to
say
the
decomp
a
adsorb
on 
the
surface
of
the
glass
walls
all
those
minerals
and
all. 
Internal
quality
control
programs
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
quality
testing
and
compliance 
with
the
standards
and
the
regulations.
 
We
need
to
train
and
the
analyst
and
there. 
So,
the
analyst
should
be
like
have
proper 
training,
proper
experience
and
has 
a
proper
judgment
mentality . 
So,
that
it
will
be
very 
much
crucial
for
us
to
prove
that
the
whatever
the 
results
that
we
are
getting
out
of
the
water 
quality
parameter
testings
are
actually
deterministic 
to
the
actual
real
wastewater
from
the 
source
itself. 
So,
it
is
very
it
is
quite
important
that
it
comes
with
the
experience
and
the 
analyst 
has
to
be
experienced
enough
to
actually
come
to
a
conclusion
that
. 
So,
the
pH 
value
is
this
so
that
means,
the
pH
value
is
this
there 
would
be
no
certain
changes
that
you 
can
expect
from
people
to
people. 
So,
this
is
it
this
is
the
conclusion
for
this
particular 
lecture
video
and
these 
are
the
some
of
the
references
that
we
can
follow .
 
So,
majorly
what
we
discussed
here
will
be
I
will
be
continuing
it
in
the
next 
lecture 
video
also
where
I
will
be
discussing
majorly
about
difference
or
the
solid
concentration 
and 
the
presence
of
different
type
of
solid
in
the
wastewater
and
how
it
can
determine 
those. 
And,
then
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
biological
oxygen,
biochemical
oxygen
demand, 
chemical
oxygen
demand,
total
organic
carbon
etcetera
and
their
relationship
and
how 
we 
can
actually
do
the
BOD
modeling
which
are
very
important. 
So,
in
this
whole
module
I
will 
be
majorly
discussing
about
the
different
type
of
pollutants 
present
in
the
wastewater
and 
that
has
to
be
that
you
should
know
so
that
in
future 
when
we
will
be
designing
it
will
be 
much
easier
for
you
to
go
ead
with
the
those 
informations
.
 
So,
that
is
it. 
Thank
you
so
much
. 
We
will
see
you
in
the
next
video.
