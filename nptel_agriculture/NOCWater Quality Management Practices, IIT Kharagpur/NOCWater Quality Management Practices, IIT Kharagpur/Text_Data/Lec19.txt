of
Sedimentation
and
Introduction
to
Primary
Sedimentation
Tank
and
its
Types
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Professor
Gaurav
Thar
Bhaumik.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology
Kharagpur .
In
this
particular
lecture
video
I
will
be
discussing
about
the
different
type
of
settling
and
how
those
different
type
of
settling
parameters
and
the
characteristics
are
important
for
us
to
know
in
order
to
understand
and
develop
a
system
like
primary
sedimentation
tank
ok.
So,
let
the
concept
that
I
will
be
covering
are
the
introduction
to
the
theory
of
sedimentation,
the
ideal
sedimentation
basin,
the
classification
of
settling,
flocculent
settling,
the
discrete
particle
settling
or
type
1
settling
and
hindered
and
compression
settling.
To
start
with
the
sedimentation
we
know
that
it
is
a
process
by
which
we
can
actually
treat
the
water
by
removing
the
suspended
solid
from
the
water
by
the
forces
of
gravity
by
the
force
of
gravity
right.
So,
in
general
the
solid
that
presence
in
the
sewage
it
can
be
in
different
form,
it
can
be
in
dissolved
form,
it
can
be
colloidal
form,
it
can
be
in
pseudo
colloidal
or
it
can
be
on
suspended
solid
form.
In
general
the
suspended
solids
are
remain
in
the
suspension
because
of
the
turbulence
of
the
moving
water .
Nevertheless
as
soon
as
the
basin
is
provided
without
the
turbulence
or
we
can
reduce
the
turbulence
or
we
can
reduce
the
temperature
difference
or
we
can
reduce
the
some
other
important
factors
this
this
suspended
solid
will
definitely
be
settled
down
ok.
So,
this
settled
solid
or
we
call
it
sludge
can
be
removed
easily
from
the
bottom
of
the
settling
tank
and
we
can
be
we
can
treat
it
separately .
In
general
30
to
40
percent
of
the
pollution
load
in
terms
of
the
biochemical
oxygen
demand
the
BOD
from
sewage
can
be
reduced
by
primary
sedimentation
itself
by
you
know
this
suspended
organic
matter
which
settles
in
the
primary
sedimentation
tank
that
actually
almost
comes
or
I
mean
like
you
know
in
general
it
adds
up
to
almost
30
to
40
percent
of
the
total
BOD
load.
The
velocity
of
at
which
the
solid
settles
and
the
bottom
it
is
called
the
settling
velocity
or
the
way
that
it
is
like
in
a
vertical
flow
I
would
say
it
is
this
vertical
velocity
it
is
called
the
settling
velocity .
In
general
what
are
the
factors
which
in
which
the
settling
velocity
depends
on
specific
gravity
of
the
settling
particles
if
the
specific
gravity
is
less
it
will
take
more
time
to
settle
is
not
it
if
it
the
specific
gravity
is
higher
it
will
take
less
time
for
it
to
settle.
Surface
nature
of
the
solid
if
it
is
if
it
is
a
having
a
higher
viscous
like
you
know
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
higher
viscous
liquid
or
say
like
it
has
a
certain
electrical
deposition
on
the
I
mean
like
some
charge
deposition
on
the
surface
and
all
these
factors
actually
makes
it
difficult
for
the
solid
tosettle
or
sometimes
you
know
it
is
a
solid
to
settle
faster
also.
Density
and
the
viscosity
of
the
wastewater ,
the
shape
of
the
solid,
the
size
of
the
natural
all
these
things
are
actually
important.
So,
why
does
the
sedimentation
occur
in
the
in
the
sewage
treatment
line?
First
is
the
grid
chamber
if
you
remember
in
the
grid
chamber
along
with
the
grid
sometimes
this
suspended
organic
matter
will
also
settled
on
the
bottom
primary
sedimentation
tank
is
there
secondary
sedimentation
tank
is
there
and
also
in
the
sludge
thickener .
So,
now
we
will
discuss
about
a
very
important
physics
I
would
say
ok.
So,
you
need
to
understand
this
first
thing
is
the
the
when
we
design
a
sedimentation
tank
we
need
to
understand
the
different
type
of
settling
characteristics
of
the
particle
different
type
of
particle
how
they
settle
on
the
on
the
on
the
any
sedimentation
tank
or
any
clarifier .
So,
we
will
discuss
about
those
different
type
of
settling
classification
and
we
will
understand
that
how
this
settling
settling
occurs
in
any
particular
sedimentation
tank
or
any
particular
clarifier
ok.
To
start
with
the
first
one
is
called
discrete
particle
settling
or
zone
1
or
the
type
1
settling.
In
type
1
settling
it
is
like
you
try
to
understand
suppose
you
have
a
separate
stone
small
stone.
So,
the
stone
if
you
put
it
in
the
water
it
it
does
not
depend
on
any
other
parameters,
but
to,
but
on
its
own
it
directly
goes
in
goes
into
the
bottom
into
the
bottom
of
the
water
body
and
settle
there.
It
is
like
a
type
1
settling
means
it
is
a
discrete
particle
settling
this
particle
it
is
not
interacting
with
any
other
particles
nearby
or
any
other
chemical
or
physical
phenomena
in
general
it
is
just
simply
because
of
the
action
of
gravity
it
goes
down
in
the
bottom
it
get
settled
there.
So,
as
easy
as
that.
So,
this
is
called
the
type
1
settling
or
the
discrete
particle
settling
ok.
So,
no
apparent
flocculation
or
interaction
happens
between
the
particles
in
normally
occurs
in
the
grid
chamber
and
the
plane
sedimentation
of
the
of
surface
waters.
In
general
the
Stokes
law
and
the
Newton's
law
are
applicable
as
per
the
settling
conditions
and
the
stable
terminal
settling
velocity
is
gained
by
the
particle
under
the
gravity
force
once
the
particle
starts
the
movement
in
a
constant
acceleration
field
which
is
opposed
by
the
drag
field
until
see.
So,
in
general
see
I
mean
if
you
see
the
terminal
velocity
which
is
the
constant
settling
velocity
at
in
at
equilibrium
it
is
nothing,
but
the
same
reason
for
which
the
water
particle
which
drops
from
the
sky
the
rain
water
it
does
it
retains
a
certain
velocity .
Otherwise
if
the
terminal
velocity
fundamental
is
not
there
the
physics
does
not
follow
this
rule
the
water
particle
will
keep
on
accumulating
with
one
another
one
with
another
at
the
end
the
water
bubbles
this
water
drops
can
be
of
say
like
couple
of
liter
in
size.
I
mean
like
it
is
possible
like
physics
unless
until
that
terminal
velocity
concept
is
there
it
may
be
like
that
or
maybe
in
general
there
is
a
chance
that
that
that
particle
will
come
with
a
very
high
velocity
that
it
can
literally
penetrate
the
thethe
earth's
crust
ok.
So,
it
is
possible
it
can
be
very
dangerous.
So,
this
is
the
same
funda
where
this
particular
this
terminal
velocity
is
there.
That
means,
the
settling
velocity
reaches
up
to
a
certain
level
and
then
it
may
retains
that
value
ok.
So,
in
general
why
won
it
happen
when;
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒=𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 −𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑦𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑦
𝐷𝑟𝑎𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒= 𝐶𝑑𝐴ρ𝑤𝑉𝑝2
2
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡= 4π𝑟3γ𝑠3
𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑦𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑦= 4π𝑟3γ𝑤3
So,
where
this
C
D
is
the
drag
coefficient
the
is
the
density
of
the
fluid
A
is
theρ𝑤
reference
area
of
the
object
facing
the
fluid
in
square
meter
V
p
is
the
settling
velocity
of
the
particle
r
is
the
radius
of
the
radius
of
the
particle
in
meter
and
say
is
the
unitγ𝑠
weight
of
the
solid
particle
in
kg
per
meter
cube
and
is
the
unit
weight
of
water
in
kgγ𝑤
per
meter
cube.
The
terminal
velocity
of
the
particle
for
spherical
surface
spherical
particle
I
would
say
for
in
when
the
particles
in
sphere
in
size
spherical
in
size
the
v
this
v
p
square
is
equal
to
𝑣𝑝2=4𝑔(𝑆𝑠−1)𝑑𝑝3𝐶𝑑
So,
where
this
V
p
is
equal
to
nothing
but
the
terminal
velocity
of
particle,
S
s
is
specific
gravity
of
the
particle,
d
p
is
the
diameter
of
the
particle,
C
d
is
the
drag
coefficient,
and
g
is
the
gravity
acceleration
ok.
Please
remember
this
equation
this
is
a
very
important
equation
this
to
find
out
this 
terminal
velocity
when
whenever
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
critical
velocity 
settling
velocity
in
any
treatment
units
this
equation
is
very
important
for
us
ok
good.
So, 
in
general
we
know
that
there
are
different
types
of
flow
laminar
flow
transitional
flow 
and
the
turbulent
flow
it
can
be
easily
differentiated
by
using
the
Reynolds
number .
If
the 
Reynolds
number
is
say
like
less
than
1
the
viscous
forces
are
more
important
than
the 
inertia
force
when
it
is
between
1
to
1000
the
inertia
and
the
viscous
force
are
equal 
having
the
equal
importance
and
case
of
inertia
forces
are
most
important
the
Reynolds 
number
will
become
more
than
1000
and
it
actually
represents
the
turbulent
flow.So,
when
we
calculate
the
drag
coefficient
using
the
Reynolds
number
this
C
D
equal
to
(3)𝐶𝑑=24𝑁𝑅
You
remember
in
the
last
calculation
in
the
last
lecture
we
did
this
we
use
this
values
this 
Cd
value
and
now
we
can
easily
understand
like
where
this
Cd.
So,
here
this
N
R
can
be 
easily
find
out
by
the
kinematic
viscosity
by
the
diameter
of
the
particle
and
then
if
you 
know
the
velocity
of
the
material.
So,
velocity
the
diameter
or
diameter
of
this
spherical 
particle
divided
by
the
kinematic
viscosity
you
can
get
the
Reynolds
number
right.
(4)𝑁𝑅=ρ𝑤.𝑣𝑝.𝑑𝑝µ=𝑣𝑝𝑑𝑝𝑣
So,
during
the
settling
in
the
laminar
flow
you
remember
this
equation
number
3
right
in
case
of
laminar
flow
where
the
force
of
viscosity
is
predominant
and
they
are
only
the
first
term
in
this
equation
(3)
is
important.
So,
that
means,
in
case
of
laminar
region
is24𝑁𝑅
the
first
one
in
the
if
you
see
the
left
top
left
the
first
one
laminar
flow
in
case
of
laminar
flow
this
C
d
value
can
be
easily
find
out
by
that
is
it
the
rest
of
the
rest
2
expressions24𝑁𝑅
are
is
to
I
mean
like
the
terms
are
not
needed
ok.
In
case
of
turbulent
region
where
the
inertia
force
is
dominant
in
the
last
one
N
R
is
more
than
1000
what
happened
in
that
case
the
first
2
terms
in
equation
number
3
is
not
significant.
So,
it
reduced
to
its
maximum
values
most
somewhere
around
0.34
to
0.40.
So,
C
d
value
becomes
very
less
it
is
around
0.
34
it
is
a
it
is
comes
down
to
very
minimum
ok.
So,
this
is
called
the
this
happens
in
case
of
turbulent
flow
what
happened
in
case
of
transitional
flow
which
is
when
it
is
in
between
laminar
and
the
turbulent
flow.
In
case
of
laminar
in
between
this
laminar
and
turbulent
flow
we
it
follows
this
equation
C
d
equal
to
0.34
ok.𝐶𝑑=24𝑁𝑅+3
𝑁𝑅+0.34
So,
in
case
of
laminar
flow
as
we
discussed
it
is
only
24
by
N
R
and
turbulent
flow
it
is
only
around
0.
34
to
0.4
and
for
transitional
flow
it
follows
this
equation
and
by
using
the
stokes
formula
you
can
easily
for
terminal
settling
velocity
under
laminar
flow
you
can
easily
calculate
V
s
equal
to
𝑣𝑠=𝑔ρ𝑠−ρ𝑤
(
)𝑑𝑝2
18µFrom
here
and
the
transition
flow
also
it
will
follow
the
same
equation.
So,
now
what
are 
the
assumptions
we
do
in
case
of
ideal
sedimentation
basin
design
first
we
need
to 
understand
this
you
see
this
you
know
the
what
is
the
difference
how
it
looks
like
laminar 
flow
and
the
turbulent
flows
and
all.
So,
here
in
general
in
case
of
ideal
sedimentation 
basin
it
type
1
settling
of
particle
occurs
the
quiz
the
question
condition
prevails
in
the 
settling
zone
and
the
even
distribution
of
the
flow
occurs
throughout
the
cross
section
of 
the
settling
chamber
the
settling
zone
you
see
it
is
like
a
continuous
you
see
that
the
there 
is
no
turbulence.
So,
there
the
uniform
distribution
of
particle
is
present
throughout
the 
depth
no
scouring
of
the
particles
occurs
after
the
settlement
also
the
wastewater 
containing
the
uniformly
distributed
sediments
enter
the
settling
tank
with
a
uniform 
velocity
capital
V
the
dischar ge
should
be
uniform
Q
the
dimension
of
the
tank
are
l
into 
say
breadth
into
b
into
settling
height
is
capital
H.
So,
for
the
velocity
flow
velocity
of 
capital
V
can
be
easily
calculated
as
per
the
equation
6
that
is
equal
to
(6)𝑉=𝑄𝐴𝐶 
A
c
is
nothing,
but
the
cross
sectional
area
of
the
tank
which
is
nothing,
but
the
breadth 
into
height.
So,
that
is
the
cross
sectional
area.
So,
Q
which
is
the
flow
rate
divided
by
the
area
you 
will
get
the
velocity
here
right.
So,
here
ok.𝑉=𝑄𝐴𝐶
So,
the
settling
velocity
can
also
be
found
with
this𝑣𝑠=𝐻𝑡0 
H
is
the
settling
depth
divided
by
is
the
detention
time
of
the
wastewater
in
the
settling𝑡0 
basin
that
is
also
possible.
So,
this
is
this
is
the
settling
velocity
settling
velocity
suppose 
it
reaches
it
from
the
top
your
wastewater
enters
and
it
goes
up
to
the
bottom
that
is 
particular
solid
particle
that
for
particular
solid
particle
to
reach
to
the
bottom
how
much 
distance
it
will
cover
H
the
settling
depth
capital
H
and
how
much
time
it
will
take
to 
settle
down
say
like
.𝑡0
So,
you
will
get
the
settling
velocity
meter
per
second
in
meter
per
second
you𝐻𝑡0 
understand.
So,
that
is
how
also
you
can
find
out
the
settling
velocity .
In
case
of
ideal 
sedimentation
basin
you
see
it
will
obviously ,
follow
this
equation
see
it
will
go
like
this. 
So,
for
ideal
basin
no
sediment
will
cross
no
solid
particle
will
cross
this
line
it
will 
obviously ,
settle
down
somewhere
here
ok.
So,
if
it
should
the
V
s
value
is
the
here
the
V 
s
is
actually
should
be
finalized
we
need
to
we
need
to
we
will
find
out
that
what
is
this 
V
s
and
what
is
this
V
s
dash
ok.
So,
in
which
case
in
general
our
target
is
to
somehow
get
the
sediment
settle
using 
maximum
following
this
zone.
So,
this
zone
is
the
one
where
actually
most
of
the 
sedimentation
occurs
I
mean
like
theoretically
our
target
will
be
like
this
ok.
So,
from
this 
trajectory
of
this
figure
2
you
can
see
the
constant
horizontal
flow
velocity
V
and
the 
different
settling
velocities
are
there
for
different
for
wastewater
entering
from
different 
depth
ok.
And
so,
in
general
the
V
s
more
than
equal
to
V
s
if
it
is
the
V
capital
V
ishigher
than
the
V
s
the
settling
velocity
the
what
will
happen
the
particles
will
settle 
down
and
completely
removed
from
the
wastewater
ok.
This
small
v
is
nothing,
but
this 
one.
So,
in
general
say
the
I
mean
like
the
velocity
in
the
in
general
the
say
velocity
at
which 
it
is
settling
on
the
bottom
if
it
is
more
than
settling
velocity
that
mean
that
means,
it
will 
definitely
settle
on
the
bottom
ok.
So,
in
general
this
quantity
of
the
settling
velocity
also 
can
be
called
surface
overflow
rate
this
or
the
surface
loading
rate
it
has
a
unit
of
meter 
cube
per
meter
square
per
hour
or
per
day
and
how
we
can
find
out
it
is
very
easy
we
just 
need
to
know
the 
t
o =𝐿.𝐵.𝐻𝑄 
So,
from
there
you
can
get
the
total
detention
time
also
t
o
.
Try
to
understand
this
fact
this
t
o
detention
time
right
Vs
what
is
Vs
here
is =𝑣𝑠𝐻=𝑣𝑠'
ℎ 
the
settling
velocity
settling
velocity
is
the
V
s
and
h
is
the
height.
So,
settling
velocity
divided
by
height
if
you
I
mean
like
if
you
have
settling
velocity 
divided
by
height
is
equal
to
from
there
also
you
can
find
out
the
settling
velocity
V
s 
dash
equal
divided
by
h
if
those
are
all
obviously ,
the
same
ok.
So,
I
think
here
the 
equation
should
be
T
0
T
0
is
in
general
it
is
in
say
it
is
in
second.
So,
you
understand.𝑣𝑠=𝐻𝐿.𝐵.𝐻𝑄=𝑄𝐿.𝐵=𝑄𝐴𝑆  
So,
from
there
you
we
can
easily
get.
So,
l
is
the
length
of
the
settling
zone
in
meter
and 
b
is
the
width
of
the
tank
and
h
is
the
height
of
the
settling
zone
and
A
S
is
the
surface
area 
surface
area
of
the
tank
and
p
is
the
particle
particle
limit.
So,
in
case
of
p
value
you
can 
easily
find
out
h
by
T
T
0
is
equal
to
obviously ,
capital
H
by
T
0
h
is
any
particular 
height
here
divided
by
T
0
which
will
be
obviously ,
if
you
divided
with
capital
H
by
T
0 
you
will
get
the
particles
the
amount
of
particles
that
it
removes.
So,
which
can
also
be 
done
by
small
h
by
capital
H.
So,
for
estimating
the
fraction
removal
on
the
particles 
entering
to
the
different
heights
can
be
easily
calculated.
In
case
of
ideal
basin
another
thing
is
like
we
normally
go
because
of
large
variation
of 
particle
size
are
there
we
batch
settling
test
we
normally
perform.
Here
if
you
see
this
is 
the
p
0
this
is
the
maximum
amount
of
particle
that
would
be
settle
there
and
then
the 
rest
of
the
portion
will
escape.
So,
here
if
you
see
the
settling
the
fraction
removed
in
the 
fraction
of
solid
that
is
removed
is
1
minus
p
0
plus
1
by
v
1
by
v
s
integration
of
0
to
p
0 
v
into
d
p.
So,
here
if
you
see
the
fraction
of
particles
first
when
1
is
to
p
0
1
minus
p
0
is 
nothing,
but
fraction
of
particles
with
the
settling
velocity
v
more
than
v
s.
That
means, 
that
much
of
this
the
v
is
more
than
v
s
what
will
happen
obviously ,
all
the
things
will 
settle
is
not
it
plus
the
portion
some
fraction
of
the
particles
will
also
stay
if
even
if
the
v 
is
less
than
v
s
right
v
is
less
than
v
s
means
the
velocity
is
the
velocity
is
less
than
the 
settling
velocity .
So,
that
means,
it
may
take
more
time
if
the
this
velocity
this
small
v
is
less
than 
settling
velocity
what
will
happen
if
it
is
less
than
settling
velocity .
That
means,
it
willtake
more
time
to
reach
some
there
is
a
chance
some
of
them
will
actually
escape
from 
the
system.
So,
it
will
not
reach
to
the
I
mean
it
will
escape
to
the
outlet
because
it
will 
not
reach
to
the
bottom
you
understand.
So,
that
is
that
is
the
thing.
So,
overall
this 
efficiency
of
settling
it
depends
on
different
factors
the
wind
effect
the
energy
dissipation 
at
the
inland
because
there
may
be
some
eddy
current
that
may
generate
the
settling
tank 
volume
the
upward
draw
at
the
outlet
the
sludge
removal
equipment
turbulence
the 
temperature
difference
the
difference
in
density
short
circuiting.
So,
short
circuiting
was
like
you
know
somehow
it
is
connected
with
another
like
in
the 
follow
up
treatment
units
and
also
it.
So,
there
are
different
efforts
at
which
actually 
settling
tank
design
actually
matters
ok.
So,
one
of
the
majors
are
tabulated
here
I
mean 
like
the
mentioned
here.
Another
type
of
settling
that
we
will
talk
about
it
is
called
the 
flocculent
settling.
So,
you
understand
about
the
zone
settling
zone
1
settling
or
the
type 
1
settling
right.
So,
in
the
discrete
particle
settling
now
we
will
talk
about
the
flocculent
settling.
So, 
how
what
is
flocculent
settling
in
case
of
flocculent
settling
what
is
happening
it 
normally
occurs
in
the
dilute
suspension
region
in
the
dilute
suspensions
what
is 
happening
certain
particles
tend
to
coalesce
and
they
form
the
aggregates
and
call
the
we 
call
it
floc.
So,
because
of
this
floc
through
this
flocculation
process
it
increases
the 
particle
size
and
slowly
it
enables
the
faster
settling
in
the
waste
water .
Sometimes
we 
purposefully
introduce
some
kind
of
chemical
which
actually
enhances
this
floc 
formation.
So,
if
the
floc
formation
will
be
more
it
will
settle
down
in
a
faster
rate
ok.
So,
normally
it
occurs
in
the
primary
settling
tank
and
also
the
upper
part
of
the
set 
secondary
settling
tank.
The
mechanism
is
majorly
the
difference
in
settling
velocity 
causes
the
faster
settling
particle
to
overtake
and
coalesce
with
the
slower
settling
once 
ok.
And
this
velocity
gradient
of
this
waste
water
lead
to
the
particles
of
high
velocity 
region
to
overtake
those
in
the
adjacent
path
with
the
slower
velocity
and
they
will
take 
each
other
and
they
will
slowly
go
down.
There
are
different
test
by
which
actually
we 
can
check
we
can
actually
identify
we
can
analyze
the
flocculent
settling
phenomena
it
is 
a
batch
settling
test
typically
required
to
evaluate
the
settling
characteristics
of
flocculent 
settling
particles.
Settling
column
test
we
conducted
to
evaluate
the
applicable
residence 
time
and
the
surface
overflow
rate
for
designing
the
sedimentation
tank.
In
this
settling
column
is
normally
constructed
with
the
same
height
as
it
is
proposed
in 
the
settling
tank
with
a
sampling
port
provided
at
equal
interval.
So,
it
is
more
like 
suppose
your
actual
settling
tank
you
want
to
design
it
for
say
5
meter
say
like
2.5
meter 
or
3
meter .
So,
for
actual
3
meter
you
what
you
design
you
design
a
small
one
small 
diameter
cylinder .
So,
this
cylinder
should
also
have
a
same
height
same
height
of
the 
settling
tank
suppose
2.
5
meter
to
3
meter .
Now ,
you
put
every
after
0.5
meter
you
make
a
hole
and
you
collect 
some
sampling
port.
This
is
called
settling
column
test
in
settling
column
test
this 
sampling
ports
are
there
in
general
the
internal
diameter
of
the
settling
column
should
be 
at
least
14
centimeter
to
minimize
the
wall
effect
to
adsorbed
in
the
wall.
And
theprecautions
what
needs
to
be
taken
the
temperature
should
be
maintained
uniform
to 
avoid
any
convection
current
and
uniform
distribution
of
solids
should
be
there
to 
maintain
throughout
the
depth
of
the
column
at
the
beginning
of
the
test.
What
are
the 
assumptions
the
duration
of
the
test
is
assumed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
settling
time 
proposed
for
the
time
and
the
samples
are
withdrawn
from
the
ports
and
examined
for 
the
suspended
solid
concentration.
What
are
the
factors
that
influence
the
flocculations
here
first
is
the
particle
size
range 
the
tank
depth
the
contact
time
the
particle
concentration
the
velocity
gradient
overflow 
rate
and
the
surface
properties
ok.
So,
if
you
if
you
see
this
flocculation
parameter
this
is 
suppose
the
graph
that
we
have
drawn.
So,
suppose
we
have
the
this
0
to
h
5
this
is
say 
like
the
height
total
depth
you
say
like
5
meter .
So,
for
this
5
meter
it
is
divided
into
say 
1
meter
each.
So,
from
there
you
take
you
have
the
port
from
the
port
you
collect
the 
sample
after
every
say
half
an
hour
60
minute
90
minute
120
minute
and
150
minute.
So,
every
other
time
whenever
you
are
collecting
the
samples
you
will
put
the
you
will 
take
the
sample
and
you
will
you
will
find
out
you
just
simply
draw
this
graph
by 
interpolating
and
extrapolating
I
mean
like
the
connect
the
different
dots
with
the 
different
values
that
you
have
found
out
and
you
prepare
this
nice
graph.
If
this
graph
if 
you
see
this
sampling
ports
and
this
settling
column
test
with
this
graph
is
actually
what 
is
this
representing
this
80
percent
line.
That
means,
this
line
representing
that
it
is
a
it
is 
called
isoremoval
line
means
this
line
is
representing
the
same
amount
of
removal
over
a 
certain
period
of
time
for
different
height.
That
means,
suppose
you
have
let
us
take
60 
percent
line
60
percent
line
if
I
take
it
is
this
line
is
actually
somehow
see
in
this 
particular
line
when
it
is
intersecting
the
30
minute
line.
That
means,
that
after
30 
minutes
in
this
particular
zone
on
above
the
water
is
removed
there
was
solid
60
percent 
of
the
remove
60
percent
of
the
solid
is
removed
on
the
top
of
it
ok.
So,
this
60
percent
removal
if
you
see
around
40
60
minute
60
minute
more
than
at
this 
particular
height.
So,
suppose
if
it
is
like
total
5
meter .
So,
it
is
1
2
3
3.5
meter
height
the 
60
percent
of
the
water
is
actually
removed
from
there
on
the
on
the
top
definitely
it
will 
be
more
because
water
becoming
more
clearer
ok.
So,
this
60
percent
line
actually 
slowly
shows
that
suppose
in
this
particular
line
after
120
minute
say
around
0.
5
meter
from
the
bottom
that
part
is
actually
having
60
percent
removal.
So,
that
means, 
it
will
take
more
time
on
the
later
size
right
like
you
know
in
I
mean
like
compute
have
a 
complete
removal
like
you
know
to
take
place
and
I
would
say
like
the
height
the
more 
you
reduces
the
height
it
will
take
like
you
know
what
will
happen
at
the
end
the
final 
removal
maximum
amount
of
removal
will
take
place
on
the
surface
much
easily
then
in 
the
bottom
ok.
So,
thus
then
in
the
bottom
that
means,
the
it
is
become
60
percent
of
the 
solid
that
means,
the
60
percent
this
means
means
like
all
this
means
after
120
minutes 
all
this
4.5
meter
height
is
normally
less
than
60
percent
solid
is
there
that
means,
the 
what
almost
it
is
clear
it
is
getting
clear .
So,
that
is
that
is
how
it
is
actually
it
looks
like.
So,
this
from
this
graph
and
using
this 
equation
this
fraction
particle
removed
in
can
be
easily
estimated
ok.
So,
we
will
do
itwe
do
one
numerical.
So,
that
you
please
write
it
down
this
equation
this
is
sum
of
H
1
to 
N
in
bracket
capital
this
delta
H
N
delta
H
N
is
nothing,
but
this
height
suppose
this
say 
let
us
take
this
80
percent
line.
So,
this
is
called
the
delta
H
this
portion
is
the
delta
H
N 
and
2
total
capital
H
is
the
total
height
capital
H
is
the
total
height
say
which
is
5
meter 
and
delta
H
will
be
say
1.6
meter
this
much
this
is
called
delta
H
in
this
particular
case.
So,
in
this
particular
case
the
removal
efficiency
also
you
can
get
R
N
is
the
represents 
the
removal
total
suspended
solid
removal
in
percentage.
So,
R
N
will
be
80
percent
and 
R
N
plus
will
be
say
like
100
percent.
So,
if
you
take
this
one.
So,
del
H
will
be
this 
portion
70
percent
to
80
percent.
So,
now,
for
this
equation
how
for
this
particular
line 
say
like
what
this
120
our
120
minute
line
70
percent
to
80
percent
this
graph
this 
portion
how
this
portion
will
be
represented
by
del
H
N
and
by
H
is
capital
H
is
5
for
this 
particular
case
just
giving
I
am
giving
you
one
any
random
example.
And
now
this
portion
now
what
will
be
the
R
N
R
N
will
be
70
plus
R
N
plus
what
is
80 
percent
is
divided
by
2.
So,
70
plus
80
divided
by
2
multiplied
by
del
H
N
say
this
much 
is
say
like
almost
1
meter
multiplied
by
1
divided
by
capital
H
means
total
5.
So,
that 
value
will
actually
represent
the
total
suspended
solid
removed
in
percentage
ok.
So,
that 
is
how
we
take
we
will
do
a
one
numerical.
So,
it
will
be
more
easier
for
you
to
you 
know
understand
ok.
So,
in
general
when
we
apply
this
laboratory
experiment.
So,
we
need
to
understand
this 
values
in
clearer
manner
ok.
So,
in
general
this
propellant
settling
the
different
eddy 
current
what
are
the
factors
that
affect
first
is
the
eddy
current.
Eddy
current
means
the 
moment
wastewater
enters
it
makes
some
hindrance
and
all
it
will
make
it
make
a
like
a 
this
kind
of
flow
it
is
like
you
know
it
will
make
a
like
a
eddy
flow
you
know
you
search 
for
it
you
know
it
is
like
water
when
drops
from
in
the
stair
it
makes
this
eddy
current 
ok.
So,
this
eddy
current
it
will
go
back
to
the
system.
So,
this
eddy
current
flows
can 
actually
formed
by
the
inertia
of
the
incoming
fluid
the
wind
induced
turbulence
on
the 
water
surface
if
it
is
like
very
huge
and
there
is
a
huge
wind
flowing
on
the
surface
on 
the
top
because
of
the
wind
the
surface
will
also
create
some
wave.
Thermal
convection
current
because
of
the
very
hot
summer
changes
in
the
temperature 
and
create
the
this
they
create
this
there
is
some
problem
in
the
propellant
settling
cold 
and
warm
water
causing
the
formation
of
density
current
and
also
thermal
stratification 
in
hot
climate
as
I
also
already
discussed.
So,
in
general
this
correlation
between
the 
removal
efficiency
r
and
the
nominal
detention
time
t
can
be
easily
represented
by
capital 
R
equal
to
t
minus
t
divided
by
a
plus
b
into
t
a
and
b
are
the
empirical
constant.
So, 
there
one
very
important
things
please
try
to
remember
the
factor
of
0.65
to
85
has
to
be 
applied
when
you
design
the
settling
velocity .
Suppose
you
will
design
this
I
mean
like 
you
will
find
out
the
settling
velocity
you
will
estimate
the
settling
velocity
in
a
column 
test,
but
in
actual
case
it
should
be
it
should
be
not
more
than
0.
85
then
the
actual
number .
Same
time
suppose
you
will
find
out
the
detention
time
of 
your
reactor
should
be
say
1
hour,
but
you
have
to
multiply
when
you
do
the
this
settling 
test
column
test
I
mean
like
in
your
column
test.
In
your
column
test
if
you
find
out
thatyour
detention
time
should
be
1
hour
in
actual
case
actual
design
you
have
to
do
it
at 
least
1.25
to
1.5
times
more.
So,
suppose
if
it
is
like
1
hour
in
case
of
column
test
you 
will
you
are
you
find
out
that
your
actual
detention
time
is
1
hour
actual
case
you
have
to 
make
it
at
least
1.
5
hour
1.25
to
1.5
hour
in
real
life
situation
ok.
So,
these
two
factors
are
very
important 
you
have
to
write
it
down
0.65
to
0.85
for
settling
velocity
and
1.
25
to
1.5
for
the
multiplication
factor
is
there
for
detention
time.
Let
us
do
this
numerical 
as
you
remember
we
so,
this
graph
is
given
to
you
this
graph
you
can
easily
find
out
by
I 
mean
like
you
can
easily
draw
it
by
yourself
when
you
have
a
settling
column
of
say
like 
what
is
the
height
given
in
the
in
this
example
2.
5
meter
ok.
So,
2.5
meter
is
the
total
height.
So,
total
height
is
2.5
meter
each
one
is 
having
us
gap
of
0.5
meter
and
there
is
a
port
1
or
port
is
there
suppose
there
is
a
say 
there
is
say
like
1
rectangular
I
mean
I
say
1
cylindrical
column
of
0.
25
2.5
meter
in
height
and
every
0.5
meter
you
have
a
port.
Then
you
calculate
the
you 
introduce
the
waste
water
in
wait
for
say
like
150
minute
and
you
get
this
line
this
in
this 
particular
graph
you
can
easily
draw .
Now
you
are
asked
that
sample
are
collected
in
the 
different
30
minutes
from
the
resident
of
the
ice
remover
and.
So,
now,
determine
the 
overall
removal
of
solid
after
1
hour
of
settling
after
1
hour
of
settling
means
60
minute 
you
have
to
find
out
the
overall
removal
of
solid
total
removal
of
solid
how
you
can
find 
out
the
total
removal
of
solid
you
remember
that
equation
you
can
easily
find
out
using 
those
this
equation
del
h
1
this
is
the
this
value
this
del
h
1
value
is
what
how
we
can
find 
out
you
can
easily
find
out
from
if
it
is
like
a
put
it
in
the
graph
paper
you
can
easily
see. 
So,
if
it
is
like
total
is
0.
5
it
will
be
somewhere
around
say
how
much
it
is
in
this
particular
case.
So,
0.5
it
is
0.313.
So,
this
value
is
0.313
in
in
this
particular
case.
So,
we
need
to
know 
this
value
we
need
to
know
h
5
h
5
is
the
whole
whole
total.
So,
all
total
h
5
is
how
much 
2.5.
So,
now,
plus
R
1
plus
R
2
R
1
is
how
much
here
90
R
1
is
sorry
R
1
is
here
100 
percent
removal
in
the
top
it
is
considered
the
100
percent
removal
and
this
line
is 
considering
the
90
percent
removal.
So,
100
plus
90
divided
by
2.
So,
from
there
you
can
get
the
removal
percentage
from 
this
portion.
Now ,
what
happened
to
the
this
portion
this
portion
del
h
2
is
how
much
say 
from
the
graph
paper
you
can
easily
find
out
it
will
be
somewhere
around
0.
156.
So,
total
is
0.5.
So,
it
is
somewhere
around
0.156
then
point
again
h
5
h
5
is
0.5 
sorry
2.5
and
we
also
know
what
is
the
R
1
here
R
2
here
R
2
is
90
R
3
is
80.
So,
90
plus 
80
divided
by
2.
So,
likewise
if
you
keep
on
doing
it
for
all
these
different
values
all 
these
different
zone.
So,
you
will
you
will
if
you
add
it
you
will
get
the
total
percentage
removal.
So,
fromfirst
zone
you
will
see
the
removal
is
11.
89
percentage
then
5.34
then
8.43
then
13.8
then
here
is
26.8.
So,
that
means,
total 
removal
is
66
percentage.
So,
after
1
hour
you
can
reach
66
percentage
of
suspended 
solid
removal.
So,
this
66
percentage
of
suspended
solid
removal
in
actual.
So,
in
actual 
case
in
order
to
reach
66
percent
how
much
time
you
will
require
you
remember
in
I
told 
you
just
in
the
last
slide
that
in
column
test
if
it
requires
1
hour
in
actual
field
scale
it 
can
be
up
to
1.
25
to
1.5
hour
ok.
So,
in
real
life
in
when
you
actually
design
the
settling
tank
in
that 
settling
tank
to
reach
this
66.25
percentage
removal
you
may
have
need
almost
1.5
hour 
of
retention
time
very
good.
So,
now,
let
us
talk
about
the
another
two
types
of
settling 
the
one
is
called
the
hindered
settling
or
the
type
3
settling
another
one
is
the 
compression
settling.
In
case
of
hindered
settling
it
is
a
intermediate
when
it
occurs
when 
an
intermediate
concentration
of
the
particles
are
present
and
which
actually
add
some 
adhesion
or
the
cohesion
forces
between
them
and
because
of
that
it
disrupts
the
settling 
of
adjoining
particles
it
is
called
the
hindered
settling
it
is
hindering
the
settling
you
can 
understand
from
the
name
and
it
is
also
called
the
zone
settling
ok.
It
is
like
a
zone
settling
it
is
settled
line
as
a
zone
then
there
is
a
compression
settling
or 
the
type
4
settling.
In
case
of
compression
settling
such
that
the
particles
are
touching 
each
other
and
further
downward
movement
is
only
possible
because
of
the
compression 
of
the
particle
in
the
binet
because
it
is
already
reaches
on
almost
the
almost
free
stages 
and
then
after
then
it
is
only
possible
for
further
settling
if
the
if
the
layer
on
the
bottom 
of
it
will
compress
then
only
the
upper
layer
will
settle
further .
So,
it
is
called
the 
compression
settling
or
type
4
settling
it
occurs
in
the
slice
sludge
thickener
the
lower 
parts
of
the
secondary
sedimentation
time
ok.
In
case
of
when
we
try
to
find
out
the 
analyze
the
hindered
settling
when
high
concentration
of
the
suspended
solid
is
present
it 
both
hindered
settling
and
compression
settling
can
be
experienced
ok.
If
you
see
this 
particular
graph
in
this
one
column
is
there
in
this
column
you
introduce
the
waste
water 
it
actually
you
can
see
this
different
type
of
settling
zone
clearly .
First
one
is
discrete
particle
settling
in
the
first
zone
where
the
this
particles
will
settle 
like
a
individual
particle.
Then
flocculant
settling
equals
you
can
witness
then
the 
hindered
zone
settling
and
then
at
the
end
on
the
bottom
you
will
see
the
compressed 
zone
settling
on
the
compressed
region.
So,
in
and
on
the
top
there
will
be
the
clear 
water .
So,
this
kind
of
column
test
will
give
you
a
clear
pictures
of
how
it
will
look
like 
if
you
have
a
transparent
glass
or
the
transparent
I
mean
like
the
plastic
cylinder
you 
made
it.
So,
from
there
you
can
easily
you
can
use
the
PVC
pipes
and
also
I
mean
like
or 
acrylonitrile
pipes
and
all.
So,
to
make
it
like
you
know
transparent
anyway .
So,
in
this
kind
of
settling
you
will
see 
this
kind
of
if
you
do
this
kind
of
single
batch
settling
test
results
you
will
see
this
capital 
H
is
actually
in
this
case
like
the
maximum
height.
So,
from
there
to
the
concentration
to 
if
you
see
the
it
will
reach
a
different
zone
this
is
the
flocculant
settling
zone
then
there
is 
a
hindered
settling
then
it
comes
to
the
compression
settling
ok.
So,
it
reaches
a
differenttime
and
because
of
that
also
you
can
see.
So,
in
general
it
looks
like
a
pyramid
the
high 
concentration
at
high
concentration
of
suspended
solid
in
the
top
basically
and
the 
flocculant
occurs
at
the
top
and
hindered
and
compression
occurs
on
the
bottom
ok.
So, 
with
time
with
the
depth
you
can
see
the
slowly
the
settling
illustration
this
is
the
settling 
parameters
you
can
see
in
the
in
the
very
typical
characteristics
of
it.
So,
this
zone
represents
this
one
this
zone
represent
this
one
and
this
is
the
secondary 
zone
this
I
mean
like
this
part
of
it
the
discrete
and
the
flocculant
part
ok.
Let
us
do
one 
numerical
to
make
it
more
like
memorable
for
you.
So,
what
we
are
doing
suppose
in 
this
particular
numerical
you
are
asked
that
in
a
settling
cylinder
of
2
meter
height.
So, 
total
H
0
is
how
much
2
meter
2
meter
of
height
in
this
figure
8
it
obtain
the
initial
mixed 
liquor
suspended
solid
concentration
of
4000
milligram
per
liter.
So,
C
0
is
given 
determine
the
area
to
yield
a
thickened
sludge
concentration
C
u
is
18
gram
per
liter.
So,
this
C
u
is
18000
milligram
per
liter
this
is
4
milligram
4
gram
per
liter
this
is
18 
gram
per
liter
ok.
So,
you
try
to
make
it
in
a
same
unit.
So,
it
will
be
easier
for
you
can 
make
it
18000
milligram
per
liter
ok
and
inflow
is
100
meter
cube
per
day
q
is
also
given 
in
the
sedimentation
tank.
So,
now,
you
know
the
C
0
value
you
also
know
the
height
2 
ok.
So,
how
you
can
find
out
the
C
H
this
value
I
mean
like
this
height
this
height
you 
can
easily
find
out
if
you
know
the
C
u
in
general
if
it
is
there
in
the
same
column
right 
in
the
same
column
the
height
multiplied
by
the
solid
concentration
initial
solid 
concentration
is
4000
milligram
per
liter.
So,
then
suppose
you
when
you
introduce
it
it
is
in
this
uniformly
present
in
the
column. 
So,
in
this
uniformly
present
in
the
column.
So,
the
height
requires
for
4000
milligram 
per
liter
is
say
2
meter
ok.
So,
what
will
what
will
be
the
height
that
it
requires
for 
having
a
final
the
sludge
thickened
sludge
concentration
of
18
gram
per
liter
it
can
be 
easily
done
by
a
simply
unitary
method
it
is
like
you
know
H
0
into
say
H
C
0
into
H
0 
equal
to
H
H
u
into
C
u.
So,
H
u
can
be
easily
find
out
C
0
into
H
0
equal
to
4000
into
2
divided
by
18000
0.44 
meter .
So,
that
means,
at
0.44
meter
you
will
have
the
thickened
sludge
I
mean
like
the 
that
you
can
expect
after
certain
time.
So,
that
also
will
be
anyway .
So,
we
can
draw
a 
horizontal
line
from
this
0.
44
to
this
compression
settling
zone
say
like
this
will
be
18
milli
18
gram
per
liter.
So,
if 
you
draw
this
line
and
from
the
C
2
C
2
is
the
zone
at
the
settling
curve
and
from
the
C
2 
curve
if
you
have
a
if
you
draw
a
tangent.
So,
this
tangent
at
it
will
interact
it
will 
intersect
this
particular
line
at
a
certain
at
certain
point
right
this
this
at
this
particular 
junction
if
you
collect
connect
that
draw
another
line
parallel
to
the
y
axis
it
will
reach 
the
time
axis
or
the
x
axis
or
the
abscissa
axis
at
certain
value.
So,
this
value
we
found 
out
at
170
minute.
So,
that
means,
after
170
minute
you
can
have
the
compress
settling
at 
0.
44
meter
height
where
the
final
sludge
volume
will
be
around
concentration
will
be
18 
gram
per
liter.
So,
from
there
you
know
the
this
value
this
a
this
T
T
H
value
T
u
valuealso
we
know
now
you
can
easily
find
out
the
area
that
it
requires
because
area
is 
nothing,
but
the
Q
into
T
u
by
h
Q
is
what
the
flow
rate
ok.
So,
if
we
know
the
flow
rate 
which
is
1000
it
is
given
1000
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
make
it
to
the
second
make
it
to 
the
minute
at
least.
So,
1000
divided
by
24
into
60.
So,
now,
we
are
making
it
into
meter 
cube
per
minute
multiplied
by
170
is
the
minute
as
we
can
find
out
from
here
170
minute 
divided
by
2
meter
is
the
actual
height
ok.
So,
from
there
you
can
easily
find
out
meter
cube
per
minute
into
minute
divided
by 
meter .
So,
it
will
become
meter
square.
So,
59.03
meter
square
is
actually
the
area
that
is 
required
for
the
clarification.
So,
this
is
the
clarification
area
that
it
requires
in
real
scale 
ok.
So,
from
here
you
can
easily
find
out
the
real
scale
clarification
area
that
it
requires. 
Also
now
we
can
easily
find
out
the
subsidence
velocity
subsidence
velocity
here
we 
know
that
from
8
0
to
say
to
in
order
to
reach
to
72.5
minute
we
can
easily
find
out
this 
is
the
flocculent
settling
zone.
If
we
know
the
flocculent
settling
zone
we
can
easily
find 
out
the
0.9
is
the
height
and
also
72.5
minute
is
the
time
that
it
requires
for
flocculent 
settling
like
I
mean
like
to
in
order
to
reduce
to
the
flocculent
I
mean
I
need
to
go
ahead 
with
the
flocculent
settling
phenomena
to
done.
So,
in
this
particular
zone
what
is
happening
flocculent
as
well
as
in
the
discrete
settling 
zone.
So,
there
this
subsidence
velocity
can
be
easily
calculated
by
2
minus
0.
9
divided
by
72.5.
So,
2
minus
2
is
the
maximum
height
and
0.9
is
the
rest
over.
So,
2 
minus
0.9
divided
by
72.5
is
the
minute.
So,
from
there
you
can
easily
calculate
the 
multiply
by
60
you
can
calculate
the
velocity
as
0.91
meter
per
hour.
So,
we
can
easily 
find
out
from
this
the
overflow
rate
overflow
rate
is
1000
if
you
see
this
particular
value 
again
particularly
again.
So,
this
is
the
total
change
in
here
2
minus
0.44
that
is
the
total
area
that
it
requires
in 
general
if
you
draw
if
you
actually
see
one
cylinder
here
this
is
the
total
area
that
is
a 
total
volume
that
is
available
and.
So,
this
in
this
volume
only
what
is
happening
the 
overflow
rate
is
happening.
So,
1000
meter
cube
divided
by
what
is
that
area
available
2 
minus
0.44
by
2
that
much
percentage
is
available
this
much
percentage
is
available
say 
if
we
have
a
cylinder .
So,
you
can
calculate
it
that
volume
is
around
780
meter
cube
per
day.
So,
this
portion
is 
actually
representing
the
overflow
rate.
So,
if
you
consider
this
value
and
we
can 
calculate
the
subsidence
velocity
we
can
get
the
area
of
35.71
meter
for
flocculent 
settling
zone.
So,
that
means,
that
area
is
not
the
controlling
area
controlling
area
is 
actually
in
the
area
required
for
the
thickening
area
which
is
the
59.
03
which
is
higher .
So,
our
design
should
be
of
59.03
not
the
35.71
you
understand.
So, 
this
59.03
if
we
introduce
we
can
easily
find
out
the
solid
settling
rate
100
meter
cube 
per
day
flow
4000
gram
per
milligram
per
liter
or
gram
per
meter
cube
is
the
if
you 
remember
the
initial
the
concentration
that
is
that
is
given.
So,
from
there
you
can
easilycalculate
the
and
the
area
is
given
as
thickening
area
the
area
required
for
the 
clarification
59.03
meter
cube
meter
square.
So,
from
this
equation
expression
we
can 
easily
get
the
solid
retention
time
60
loading
rate
67.76
kg
per
meter
square
per
day
and 
hydraulic
loading
rate
also
we
can
get
it
to
total
area
for
the
overflow
rate
is
I
mean
like 
overflow
rate
is
780
meter
cube
per
day
divided
by
the
area
the
area
for
thickening 
which
is
59
meter
square.
So,
from
there
hydraulic
loading
rate
will
be
13.21
meter
cube
per
meter
square
per
day 
please
remember
this
steps
when
you
are
going
to
design
it.
So,
good.
So,
what
we
have 
discussed
in
this
lecture
till
now
it
is
we
did
not
discuss
about
the
different
type
of 
settling.
So,
we
have
a
very
good
idea
now
what
is
type
1
settling
what
is
type
2
settling 
type
3
and
type
4
and
how
we
can
actually
calculate
those
settling
values
and
all.
So,
this 
is
a
very
important
for
you
to
understand
in
order
to
design
a
primary
sedimentation
tank 
which
will
be
doing
in
the
coming
week
ok.
So,
this
is
the
reference
sequencing
and
thank
you
so
much
we
will
see
in
the
next 
lecture
video
with
the
further
discussion
about
the
primary
sedimentation
tank
design 
and
all
ok.
Thank
you
so
much.
