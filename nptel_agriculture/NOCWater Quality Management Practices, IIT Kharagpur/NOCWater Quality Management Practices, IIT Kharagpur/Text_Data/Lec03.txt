Emer ging
Concerns
in
Wastewater
Treatment
in
Global
Scenario
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav
Dharwamiq.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology ,
Kharagpur .
In
this
particular
lecture
continuing
to
the
introductory
module
that
we
are
doing
it
for
this
course,
I
will
be
majorly
discussing
about
the
emer ging
concerns
in
the
wastewater
treatment
in
the
global
scenario.
The
major
content
will
be
to
highlight
the
emer ging
concerns
to
be
precise
the
emer ging
contaminants,
I
will
be
discussing
about
that
in
detail.
What
are
the
WHO
recommendations?
What
are
the
major
sources
of
this
emer ging
contaminants?
And
what
are
the
effects
environmental
effects
of
this
emer ging
contaminants
specifically
focusing
on
PPCVs
you
know
the
full
form
of
it
majorly
the
pharmaceuticals
and
the
personal
care
products
PPCV
pharmaceuticals
and
the
personal
care
products
and
the
antibiotics
are
the
major
environmental
concern
and
the
emer ging
contaminants
that
we
will
be
discussing
in
details.
Other
than
the
emer ging
technologies
that
is
to
be
incorporated
in
the
wastewater
treatment
to
facilitate
the
you
know
emer ging
contaminant
removal
from
the
system.
Considering
the
highlighting
the
emer ging
concerns
in
the
wastewater
treatment
in
global
scenario
to
start
with
as
I
was
discussing
that
in
the
last
lecture
if
you
remember
we
were
discussing
about
the
different
type
of
pollutants
present
in
the
wastewater
that
we
normally
has
to
deal
with
right.
Like
you
know
majorly
during
using
the
treatment
plant
or
any
decentralized
or
centralized
treatment
units
by
which
we
can
actually
deal
those
pollutants.
Recently
for
last
couple
of
years
and
say
like
in
a
for
a
decade
now
scientists
are
really
puzzled
with
the
number
of
pollutant
that
number
of
type
of
pollutants
that
is
increasing
in
the
system.
And
this
different
types
of
new
pollutants
this
emer ging
pollutants
or
the
contaminants
that
we
call
are
of
major
concern
because
it
requires
us
completely
separate
analysis
procedure
for
us
to
understand
the
the
the
the
vanity
of
the
situation
that
how
much
of
its
concentration
is
actually
severe
for
human
health
or
say
animal
health
or
say
for
the
ecosystem.
And
the
same
times
the
detection
procedure
is
tough
and
has
to
be
developed
day
to
day
basis
at
the
same
times
the
procedures
or
the
technologies
that
is
actually
perfect
or
the
optimum
for
reducing
those
contaminants
from
the
wastewater
treatment
line
is
also
something
new
something
being
researched
daily
basis
now
a
for
the
last
couple
of
years.
And
all
over
world
people
are
working
on
this
emer ging
contaminant
removal
and
because
of
its
adverse
effects
and
the
the
the
problems
that
is
associated
with
it.
Majorly
if
you
see
those
emer ging
contaminants
what
are
they?
They
are
nothing,
but
the
pharmaceutical
products
majorly .
You
know
the
India
being
the
one
ofthe
pharmaceutical
hub
of
this
world
and
surprisingly
however ,
other
than
India
another
continent
like
I
mean
like
India
being
in
the
south
eastern
part
of
this
Asian
continent
and
also
the
north
is
North
America
as
a
continent
is
one
of
the
major
producer
of
the
pharmaceutical
waste
in
this
world.
Other
than
that
this
personal
care
products
is
also
being
nowadays
blooming
like
anything
because
people
started
using
it
in
a
daily
basis
and
it
is
the
the
percent
number
is
very
high
I
will
discuss
about
all
these
things
like
how
what
is
the
number
game
in
this
case
and
the
country
basis
or
the
continent
basis.
Other
than
that
this
some
persistent
and
mobile
chemicals
or
PMCs
in
in
short
we
call
it
are
also
causing
a
huge
harm
to
the
ecosystem
by
actually
entering
to
our
food
chain
by
entering
to
our
human
body
through
this
food
chain
and
its
cause
unless
until
we
will
actually
focus
on
the
development
of
new
technology
and
modification
or
the
retrofitting
the
existing
technology
in
order
to
eliminate
those
PPCPs
or
PCMs
the
future
is
very
heinous
and
we
have
to
really
work
on
it
and
that
is
the
major
focus
of
our
lecture
today
to
discuss
about
the
what
are
the
different
type
of
PPCPs
and
the
PCMs
that
needs
to
be
you
know
focus
that
need
that
should
be
a
research
focus
for
hours
and
scientist
all
around
the
world
and
what
are
the
technologies
those
are
available
to
eliminate
it.
So,
how
this
PPCPs
and
PMCs
are
actually
causing
harm
it
is
it
makes
this
antibiotic
resistance
biotic
or
the
microbial
organisms
it
it
actually
it
creates
an
environment
suitable
for
those
kind
of
microor ganisms
to
survive
and
they
actually
become
antibiotic
resistance
resistant
I
would
say.
Other
than
that
the
microplastics
the
presence
of
microplastics
is
one
of
the
major
you
know
I
would
say
that
the
cons
part
of
this
PPCPs
and
PMCs
and
majorly
what
they
are
doing
this
microplastics
and
now
it
is
it
not
only
increase
enhance
like
you
know
somehow
entering
to
our
food
chain,
but
also
it
is
entering
to
our
in
a
very
cell
you
know
almost
in
the
cellular
level
inside
the
present
also
like
I
was
saying
in
the
last
lecture
there
are
research
studies
which
where
people
have
found
out
that
key
researchers
have
found
key
this
microplastics
are
present
in
the
human
placenta
and
also
there
in
the
breast
milk.
It
also
creates
the
nutrient
balance
imbalance
and
so,
emer ging
technologies
and
the
it
is
energy
consumption
also
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
because
some
of
these
technologies
which
are
suitable
for
removing
this
emer ging
contaminants.
However ,
it
is
a
energy
consuming
process.
So,
at
the
same
times
in
order
to
reduce
one
harm
environmental
harm
we
can
cause
another
kind
of
a
harm.
So,
we
have
to
optimize
this
procedures
and
this
technology
the
uses
of
this
technology
and
the
the
find
out
the
best
available
technologies
or
in
short
we
call
it
BAT
for
treating
this
kind
of
emer ging
contaminants
and
all.
So,
although
the
most
of
the
domestic
waste
it
does
not
contain
the
inorganic
matter
or
say
like
refractic
organic
compounds
as
I
was
discussing
the
synthetic
organic
compound
at
a
highly
toxic
matter ,
but
they
are
present
in
the
COS
due
to
the
increased
use
of
this
personal
care
products
or
the
cosmetics
and
all.
What
are
theeffects
of
it?
First
the
antiviral
ah
antimicrobial
resistance
as
I
was
discussing
that
the
the
microbes
become
antibiotic
ah
antibiotic
resistance
at
the
same
times
this
antimicrobial
resistance
it
caused
various
type
of
persistent
mobile
chemicals
to
lead
to
ah
like
huge
adverse
effect
the
even
human
health
the
financial
and
the
social
cost.
Its
long
term
environmental
persistence
can
because
it
it
it
cannot
degrade
easily
it
takes
years
it
takes
centuries
to
degrade
in
the
natural
environment
and
it
leads
to
a
long
term
exposure
of
to
the
aquatic
aquatic
organisms
and
all
it
has
the
capacity
to
disrupt
the
endocrine
like
and
we
call
it
the
endocrine
disruptors.
So,
what
it
does
it
actually
ah
this
kind
of
pharmaceuticals
or
the
personal
care
products
PPCBs
they
they
they
what
they
do
they
act
as
a
endocrine
disruptor
in
the
aquatic
organisms
and
leading
to
a
reproductive
and
the
development
abnormalities
in
the
ah
in
their
in
their
ah
life
time.
Other
than
that
the
metabolism
disruption
is
also
happening
and
because
of
that
at
the
end
it
leads
to
the
death
of
those
aquatic
animals
and
all.
At
the
end
it
is
not
only
the
death
of
those
aquatic
animals,
aquatic
species,
but
also
it
comes
to
us
also
ah
in
the
form
of
a
few
in
the
in
the
in
the
when
it
enters
the
human
food
chain
and
it
actually
comes
to
us
and
we
it
actually
affects
us
as
well.
How
it
happens
you
see
this
pharmaceutical
and
antibiotics
when
we
have
this
doses.
So,
administration
of
this
antibiotic
to
human
it
causes
if
you
see
in
the
from
the
left
side
to
right
side
we
will
go.
It
not
only
ah
provided
to
the
humans,
but
also
provided
to
the
animals
for
their
for
is
faster
growth
or
for
their
disease
control.
It
reaches
then
it
reaches
to
the
to
the
sewage
line
I
mean
like
sewerage
systems
and
all
and
what
happens
there
those
bacteria
will
become
this
drug
resistance.
So,
this
drug
resistance
one
they
become
this
drug
resistance
resistant
they
will
pass
to
this
terrestrial
and
the
marine
environment
and
at
the
end
it
comes
to
the
food
it
comes
to
the
food
chain
and
it
actually
enters
through
to
us
through
this
drinking
through
drinking
water
or
through
the
food
that
we
are
consuming
on
daily
basis.
So,
this
drug
resistance
bacteria
are
very
dangerous
it
can
ah
it
ah
can
actually
cause
us
to
be
you
know
infected
like
infected
ah
with
the
different
kind
of
a
diseases
and
we
can
easily
ah
get
affected
and
even
there
are
instances
where
people
even
ah
succumb
to
death
because
of
this
ah
EC's
the
excess
amount
of
EC's
present
in
then
also.
Another
major
drawback
of
ah
this
ah
emer ging
contaminants
are
it
is
a
it
is
majorly
they
are
the
carcinogenic
almost
99
percent
of
them
are
are
carcinogenic
in
nature.
So,
the
moment
they
will
enter
to
enter
your
health
in
enter
your
body
it
can
cause
drastic
trauma
to
our
system
and
it
can
ah
cause
ah
some
carcinogenic
ah
affect
to
the
system.
So,
WHO
ah
recommendations
on
the
endocrine
disruptors
in
the
ah
in
the
wastewater
if
I
say.
So,
if
you
see
the
beta
estradiol
or
the
noniphenol
or
the
bisphenol
A
it
is
one
of
the
major
ah
endocrine
disruptors.
This
bisphenol
A
you
can
easily
find
it
in
the
plasticthis
PET
bottles
that
we
normally
ah
use
that
the
for
the
drinking
purposes
and
all
I
mean
it
is
possible
to
have
a
ah
leach
it
through
the
single
use
plastics.
That
is
one
of
the
major
reason
that
people
normally
ah
request
like
the
scientists
the
policymakers
they
request
us
to
not
to
use
the
single
use
plastics
and
all
because
once
it
is
ah
it
forms
in
favorable
environment
like
specially
like
you
know
ah
when
the
temperature
is
higher
and
all
and
you
put
some
hot
food
or
any
ah
changes
in
the
pH
and
all.
So,
this
can
leach
to
your
food
and
that
food
once
you
consume
it
you
can
actually
consuming
a
huge
amount
of
this
ah
endocrine
disruptors.
This
endocrine
disruptors
even
in
the
in
a
in
a
as
low
as
1
micro
gram
per
liter
ah
can
be
ah
very
harmful
for
your
body .
So,
in
general
the
recommendations
based
on
the
world
health
world
health
organization
is
to
make
it
as
low
as
possible.
So,
below
then
ah
0.
1
milli
micro
gram
per
liter.
If
you
see
the
regional
distribution
is
very
interesting.
So,
here
ah
if
you
see
this
graph
in
the
market
share
and
the
the
the
report
by
the
statistic
2023
it
is
the
forecast
of
the
regional
distribution
of
ah
the
global
pharmaceutical
market
in
2023.
If
you
see
the
North
America
45
percent
of
the
market
is
dominated
by
the
Northern
American
ah
countries.
Then
there
comes
the
Asia
Pacific,
then
Europe,
Latin
America
and
at
the
end
the
Middle
East
and
the
African
region.
So,
if
you
see
this
North
American
and
the
Asia
Pacific
region
this
the
presence
of
ah
this
pharmaceutical
market
and
it
actually
causes
a
huge
ah
you
know
impact
ah
to
the
wastewater
treatment
systems
as
well
because
those
antibiotics
and
those
pharmaceutical
products
are
actually
people
are
consuming
and
what
happen.
Nowadays
you
know
people
even
for
a
very
minute
ah
simile
affect
ah
minute
similar
changes
in
their
health
also
they
become
worried
and
they
go
to
the
go
to
the
hospital
and
actually
get
them
some
checked
and
get
a
lot
of
medicines.
Specially
countries
ah
most
of
the
countries
like
India
and
all
it
is
very
easy
for
you
to
get
ah
lot
of
medicines
from
the
doctor .
It
is
clearly
not
a
healthy
solution
clearly
not
a
healthy
solution
for
environment
at
least
to
have
so
many
medicines
at
the
same
go
and
like
even
if
you
have
a
very
mild
ah
health
ah
abnormalities
and
all.
So,
anyway
so
I
am
not
a
doctor
I
am
not
a
doctor
of
medicines.
So,
I
cannot
suggest
you
all
these
things,
but
I
can
all
at
least
request
to
reduce
the
consumption
of
medicine
as
much
as
possible
and
focus
on
having
healthy
ah
vegetables
or
fruit
based
diet
and
also
if
possible
some
animal
protein
based
diet
also.
It
is
better
than
ah
having
as
a
lot
of
medicines
and
all
because
at
the
end
what
is
happening
you
know
those
medicines
it
actually
creates
a
lot
of
noises
in
the
wastewater
that
is
generating
out
of
your
system
out
of
your
systems
and
at
the
same
times
from
the
water
that
is
coming
out
of
ah
the
the
the
unit
I
mean
like
the
apartment
or
the
building
or
the
colony
that
you
are
staying.
That
water
will
have
those
ah
those
chemicals
and
thosewhat
will
happen
those
bacteria
or
the
microor ganisms
which
are
growing
in
those
sewer
systems
ah
the
sewer
systems
what
they
do
they
will
do
they
will
consume
those
they
will
somehow
have
some
anti
micro
anti
drug
resistance
in
their
body .
So,
in
that
can
be
very
dangerous
actually .
So,
anyway
so
this
is
something
that
I
I
was
thinking
of
discussing
with
you
another
another
thing
is
the
consumption
of
this
pharmaceutical
products
it
is
worldwide
annual
per
capita
consumption
is
around
15
gram
which
is
if
you
consider
now
the
developed
countries
it
is
almost
3
to
10
times
higher
in
the
developed
countries
which
is
a
lot.
So,
can
you
imagine
50
to
150
gram
of
ah
pharmaceuticals
are
being
consumed
per
capita
per
year
ah
by
countries
like
most
of
the
countries
in
ah
the
Europe
and
USA.
So,
which
has
to
which
being
the
advanced
country
they
can
easily
reduce
it
the
consumption
of
all
this
pharmaceutical
intake
of
this
pharmaceutical
products
and
all
ok.
Then
I
would
I
would
not
say
like
India
is
also
far
ah
behind
in
this
India
is
also
in
ah
almost
going
at
part.
So,
we
also
need
to
reduce
the
consumption
of
consumption
of
at
least
the
antibiotic
anti
microbial
product
as
little
as
possible
to
start
with.
Other
than
ah
you
see
the
majority
of
this
persistent
and
mobile
chemicals
as
I
was
discussing
PMCs
and
the
pharmaceuticals
and
personal
care
products
PPCBs
are
coming
from
the
industries
agriculture
or
the
household.
Household
we
already
discussed
in
details
that
from
where
this
households
PPCBs
are
coming.
We
know
from
agriculture
from
agriculture
also
when
the
agriculture
runof f
is
taken
because
of
the
agriculture
runof f
phenomena
also
we
can
actually
ah
it
can
actually
contribute
to
a
huge
amount
of
PPCBs
and
the
like
you
know
PMCs
especially
ah
in
the
regular
water
surface
water
bodies
and
all.
And
industries
definitely
the
pharmaceutical
industries
the
personal
care
products
ah
whoever
ah
manufacturing
it
those
industries
are
also
causing
a
huge
harm.
And
if
they
are
not
treating
their
waste
water
in
a
in
their
ETPs
effluent
treatment
plants
it
and
then
there
before
doing
that
if
they
release
it
into
the
surface
water
body
that
can
cause
a
huge
issues
in
the
follow
up
systems
and
all
ok.
The
ecosystem
can
be
ah
completely
ah
geo-paradise
because
of
that.
So,
we
need
to
reduce
the
ah
consumption
of
pharmaceutical
the
personal
care
product
as
much
as
possible
unless
until
it
is
organically
built
or
it
has
a
biodegradable
ah
chemicals
there
is
should
be
whenever
you
buy
any
ah
personal
care
products
I
mean
like
it
is
it
can
be
cream
it
can
be
powder
and
anything
you
should
always
check
it
is
ingredient
you
should
always
you
know
ah
make
sure
that
the
ingredients
of
all
this
product
should
be
environmental
should
not
be
environmentally
ah
harming
I
mean
like
you
know
it
should
be
ah
it
should
not
be
having
any
component
or
any
chemicals
which
can
cause
a
huge
disruption
in
the
ecosystem
that
you
are
ah
relying
on
ok.
Ah
So,
other
than
that
the
pharmaceutical
uses
also
as
I
was
discussing
you
try
to
reduce
it
as
much
aspossible
even
if
you
not
if
you
cannot
you
try
to
avoid
the
you
know
I
mean
like
the
throwing
of
unused
ah
medicines
or
unused
ah
or
the
whatever
the
excretion
excretory
product
in
the
regular
ah
water
body
then
better
than
you
use
the
septic
tank
I
mean
like
at
least
a
centralized
ah
wastewater
unit
you
treatment
unit
you
go
ahead
with
that
rather
than
the
I
mean
like
decentralized
one
rather
than
going
through
the
centralized
one
I
am
sorry .
So,
so
that
what
will
happen
whatever
the
problems
or
whatever
the
hospital
waste
or
whatever
the
industrial
waste
that
you
will
generate
which
may
have
a
higher
amount
of
PPCBs
you
can
actually
confine
it
to
a
certain
limit
confine
it
to
a
certain
well
or
certain
ah
septic
tank
dischar ge
and
all
this
and
so,
that
it
will
not
leach
through
it
and
it
will
not
come
in
contact
with
the
groundwater
also
you
have
to
make
sure
that
and
also
please
do
not
throw
it
in
the
surface
water
body
unless
until
you
are
sure
about
a
the
contamination
level
is
ah
well
within
the
permissible
limit
set
by
that
a
world
health
organization
or
the
central
pollution
control
board
in
India
or
the
national
green
tribunal
tribunal
NGT s
ah
NGT
in
India.
How
this
ah
this
PMCs
of
the
PPCBs
are
getting
to
the
environment
we
already
discussed
that
first
of
all
the
direct
disposal
the
industrial
effluent
ah
we
if
we
directly
dispose
it
and
also
the
wastewater
treatment
plants
also
from
there
also
through
the
leakage
and
all
the
sewer
can
actually
come
in
contact
with
the
surface
water
and
gradually
it
goes
to
the
sea
water
and
all
even
even
if
it
is
a
surface
water
in
somewhere
it
can
actually
leach
through
the
soil
and
it
can
reach
the
groundwater
as
well.
So,
and
also
in
agriculture
and
all
pesticides
and
all
we
when
we
use
the
sprayers
that
can
also
this
spraying
phenomena
then
it
can
cause
also
the
aerosols.
Because
aerosols
can
also
ah
contain
this
PPCBs
which
directly
comes
in
contact
when
it
directly
comes
in
contact
with
any
human
being
it
can
affect
our
body
as
well
it
can
go
it
can
go
inside
our
body
and
it
can
accumulate
ok.
So,
in
general
our
target
is
to
reduce
the
points
like
you
know
the
as
like
you
know
to
check
the
leakage
from
the
treatment
units
treatment
line
ah
water
treatment
line
or
wastewater
treatment
line
reduce
the
direct
or
indirect
disposal
of
ah
this
ah
kind
of
hazardous
ah
emer ging
contaminants
if
it
is
present
in
your
ah
industry
wastewater
or
industry
waste
or
ah
hospital
waste
or
hospital
wastewater
ah
try
to
avoid
the
exposure
ah
by
this
kind
of
chemicals
by
putting
the
mask
in
those
ah
region
with
the
higher
amount
of
PPCBs
can
be
found.
Try
to
avoid
somehow
rechar ging
the
groundwater
if
try
to
ah
look
in
look
around
and
see
that
what
are
the
possible
way
that
ah
your
PPCB
that
you
are
generating
out
of
your
household
or
industry
can
reach
to
the
groundwater
you
have
to
make
a
decision
there
and
you
have
to
somehow
make
sure
that
it
will
not
reach
to
the
groundwater .
So,
that
you
can
ah
actually
treat
it
before
that
only
and
then
you
can
leave
it
to
the
groundwater
level.
What
are
the
emer ging
technologies
that
is
ah
coming
up
in
this
wastewater
treatment
ah
scenario
which
can
facilitate
the
emer ging
contaminant
removal?
To
start
with
if
I
ah
make
it
easier
for
you
the
most
of
this
emer ging
contaminants
you
know
what
it
isnothing,
but
it
is
a
ah
longer
chain
organic
ah
chemicals
you
know
measured
you
know
which
has
a
very
long
chain.
So,
how
we
can
reduce
I
mean
that
is
the
reason
why
it
it
is
very
hard
for
the
microbes
to
actually
consume
it.
So,
what
you
can
do
you
can
break
those
chain
you
can
make
it
to
some
other
byproducts
which
can
be
biodegradable
I
mean
like.
So,
make
it
to
the
hardly
biodegradable
you
have
to
somehow
convert
it
into
biodegradable
product.
So,
how
we
can
do
that
how
we
can
break
those
chain
how
we
can
break
those
ah
like
you
know
because
it
needs
some
high
amount
of
energy
right.
So,
it
is
this
is
done
by
a
process
called
advanced
oxidation
process
there
are
different
other
processes
as
well.
In
advanced
oxidation
process
what
is
the
basic
funda
here
you
are
somehow
generating
some
reactive
oxygen
species
ROS
ok.
So,
what
is
this
ROS
is
nothing,
but
you
know
some
radicals
like
you
know
say
oxygen
radicals
say
hydroxyl
radicals
and
also
this
radicals
what
they
are
doing
this
radicals
are
actually
having
a
very
high
oxidizing
capacity .
So,
it
will
it
will
break
the
ah
it
will
do
the
cell
lysis
or
it
will
somehow
ah
reduce
the
you
know
the
the
higher
chain
I
mean
this
chemicals
to
a
lower
chain
once
or
somehow
ah
in
a
in
a
in
a
byproduct
which
can
easily
degradable
in
the
later
stage
of
the
reaction.
So,
that
is
the
major
purpose
of
it
ok.
So,
once
how
we
can
do
that
we
can
do
this
we
can
actually
do
this
kind
of
job
by
introducing
some
photo
catalyst.
Those
photo
catalyst
in
the
presence
of
solar
irradiation
or
say
artificial
irradiation
this
photo
catalyst
what
it
does
it
actually
either
release
or
consume
absorb
some
amount
of
energy.
Whatever
it
does
and
in
general
this
because
of
this
phenomena
what
is
happening
the
energy
that
it
actually
liberated
that
can
be
useful
for
generating
this
ah
radicals
and
this
reactive
oxygen
free
radicals
or
the
reactive
oxygen
species
that
can
actually
drastically
reduce
the
ah
emer ging
contaminant
ah
presence
in
the
wastewater .
Other
than
that
you
can
directly
use
the
solar
irradiation
also
other
than
that
you
can
use
the
fundamentals
ah
like
you
know
ozone.
So,
ozone
ah
treatment
is
another
treatment
another
way
by
which
you
can
actually
reduce
the
emer ging
contaminant
there
are
technologies
like
ah
other
kind
of
photo
catalysis
technologies
cavitation
technology
another
way
of
doing
it
ultrasonication
technology
by
which
actually
you
can
create
this
ROSs
and
actually
at
the
end
you
can
reduce
the
emer ging
contaminant
concentration
in
the
systems.
Nowadays
people
are
also
working
on
the
different
type
of
ah
microbial
technologies.
In
those
microbial
ah
fuel
cell
technology
we
what
we
call
what
is
happening
you
have
a
anodic
chamber
you
have
a
cathodic
chamber
in
the
anodic
chamber
those
microbial
ah
say
inoculum
that
you
are
providing
it
with.
This
inoculum
will
consume
the
waste
present
in
the
I
mean
like
the
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater
and
it
will
create
someenergy
that
energy
will
be
like
somehow
we
harvest
it
using
this
anode
and
cathode
some
may
we
will
make
a
circuit
we
make
a
proton
exchange
membrane
in
between.
I
will
be
discussing
with
you
in
details
in
the
I
think
in
the
8th
or
9th
module
about
how
this
bio-autogramical
system
works.
So,
at
the
end
by
this
kind
of
systems
in
the
cathode
also
you
can
actually
ah
reduce
the
presence
of
ah
this
emer ging
contaminants
or
the
PPCBs
and
all
and
there
are
lot
of
studies
also
regarding
that
is
also
available
in
the
ah
Google
I
mean
like
available
in
the
ah
research
ah
archives.
As
I
was
discussing
the
TiO2
based
nanocomposites
are
also
one
of
the
very
famous
ones
that
is
also
nothing,
but
it
is
a
photo
catalyst.
Then
also
graphite
based
ah
some
graphene
based
hybrid
materials
are
also
coming
up
nowadays
which
can
also
act
as
a
treat
act
as
for
treating
like
you
know
for
treating
this
ah
PPCBs
and
all.
Other
than
that
ah
nowadays
another
ah
kind
of
organic
way
of
treating
this
kind
of
chemicals
are
also
coming
up
like
you
know
we
call
it
ah
constructed
ah
wetland
combined
with
the
action
of
plant
absorption
ah
adsorption
ah
and
the
biodegradation
by
microor ganisms
living
in
the
wetland.
So,
what
is
this
wetland?
You
might
have
heard
about
the
Nalban
or
Salt
Lake
area
in
the
Kolkata
ah
in
India.
So,
what
is
happening
if
you
see
that
this
is
one
of
the
finest
example
of
how
we
can
treat
a
city's
wastewater
using
only
a
kind
of
a
wetland
like
structure
ok.
So,
what
is
happening
those
treatment
of
wastewater
is
being
done
you
simply
broadcast
it
or
distribute
it
into
the
huge
ah
lake
like
structure
in
that
lake
there
will
be
like
plenty
of
fishes
and
also
you
right
next
to
it
you
have
you
have
a
island
of
ah
Kanandika
species
like
that
Kanandika
is
one
of
the
species
of
this
wetland
plant
where
those
wetland
plant
are
actually
consumed
ah
the
all
the
ah
pollutants
like
some
pollutants
present
in
your
ah
wastewater
majorly
the
nutrients
through
its
root
system
and
it
will
make
it
ah
the
moment
it
will
come
out
of
this
this
wetland
ah
it
becomes
completely
pollutant
free
not
completely
I
mean
like
some
degree
of
ah
removal
is
happening
inside
the
inside
this
kind
of
wetland.
So,
now,
constructed
wetland
is
what
like
it
somehow
it
you
reduce
down
the
actual
footprint
of
the
wetland
and
you
make
it
either
vertical
or
horizontal
ah
compartments
by
which
actually
those
water
will
either
go
up
and
down
or
you
know
directly
straight
or
upwards
or
downwards
movement.
So,
through
this
different
ah
structures
or
the
orientations
we
are
treating
the
pollutant
present
in
the
wastewater
and
that
after
it
will
come
out
of
this
wetland
it
will
be
kind
of
pollutant
free
it
will
somehow
reduce
the
efficient
somehow
reduce
the
actual
ah
amount
of
pollutant
present
in
the
inlet
wastewater .
So,
it
reduces
suppose
70
percent
80
percent
efficiency
you
can
reach
out
of
it.
So,
that
is
how
it
normally
ah
happens.
So,
in
this
ah
wetland
system
also
ah
there
are
different
concepts
by
which
actually
degradation
mechanism
is
happening
in
people
like
there
are
researches
where
people
have
found
out
about
the
presence
of
sunlight
is
alsovery
important
here
because
it
is
not
only
the
plant,
but
also
the
in
presence
of
sunlight
different
aerobic
microor ganisms
which
can
also
has
the
capacity
to
reduce
the
to
degrade
those
ah
PPCBs
are
also
ah
come
into
the
picture
and
they
are
actually
helping
the
degradation
or
the
biodegradation
of
this
ah
in
emer ging
contaminants
from
the
inlet
wastewater .
So,
this
is
just
some
example
of
ah
different
ah
technologies.
I
will
be
discussing
with
you
in
details
about
this
technologies
in
the
very
ah
I
mean
like
I
think
the
seventh
or
eighth
module
of
ah
the
lecture
series
where
the
tertiary
treatment
units
will
be
discussed.
I
want
you
to
be
focusing
on
this
technologies
because
it
is
very
important
for
you
to
understand
this
basics
before
going
into
the
further
mathematical
interpretations
and
all.
So,
ah
how
this
technologies
work
that
is
our
major
concern
and
that
is
our
major
goal
to
understand.
So,
in
conclusion
in
this
ah
lecture
series
we
discussed
about
the
emer ging
contaminants
which
can
pose
a
environmental
risk
due
to
the
persistent
toxicity
in
the
water
bodies.
It
is
essential
to
employ
advanced
wastewater
treatment
technologies
as
I
was
discussing
for
the
last
2
slides
for
effective
removal
of
this
ah
contaminant
to
make
the
water
suitable
for
use
and
prevent
the
accumulation
of
harmful
compound
and
to
prevent
it
to
be
ah
entering
to
our
food
chain
ok
very
good.
So,
sewage
treatment
plants
ah
like
you
know
majorly
they
incorporate
the
tertiary
treatment
units
which
are
able
to
remove
this
emer ging
contaminants
as
I
was
discussing
and
this
tertiary
treatment
units
are
also
ah
designing
ah
with
the
concept
of
this
irradiation
either
solar
radiations
or
in
the
base
of
UV
radiations
I
mean
like
if
you
doing
it
ah
artificially
you
can
go
ahead
with
the
ozone
treatment
you
can
go
ahead
with
the
photovoltaist
and
we
can
go
ahead
with
the
different
other
mechanisms
are
there
bio
electrochemical
systems
ah
like
ah
we
will
discuss
about
it
in
the
during
the
discussion
on
the
tertiary
treatment
units
and
all
ok.
Our
main
goal
is
to
guarantee
the
safety
of
the
treated
sewage
for
dischar ge
into
the
water
bodies
surface
water
bodies
or
if
I
are
using
it
for
onsite
reuse.
So,
we
have
to
make
sure
that
the
wastewater
treatment
plant
whatever
will
be
designing
it
completely
eradicate
the
presence
of
in
emer ging
contaminants
or
the
this
whatever
if
it
is
like
a
PPCB's
pharmaceutical
or
a
personal
care
product
or
whatever
if
it
is
a
persistent
or
any
other
ah
mobile
chemicals
and
all
ok.
So,
I
hope
you
understand
the
concept
ah
of
emer ging
contaminants
and
we
will
be
discussing
in
details
I
would
really
request
you
to
go
through
this
references
and
if
it
is
possible
you
personally
you
search
for
it
and
try
to
know
more
in
details
what
is
this
emer ging
contaminants
and
what
is
the
severity
of
this
emer ging
contaminants
in
the
scenario
in
the
actual
scenario.
So,
I
hope
you
get
to
know
about
this
emer ging
contaminants
and
the
microplasticsPPCB's
and
the
PCM's
and
all
IPM's
and
all.
So,
ah
we
will
continue
with
this
discussion
ah
in
the
introductory
session
ah
of
lecture
4
ah
till
then.
Thank
you
so
much.
