Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharmami.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
Indian
Institute
of
Technology ,
Kharagpur .
Continuing
with
the
module
7,
Aerobic
Waste
Water
Treatment
System
and
in
this
particular
lecture
I
will
be
discussing
about
the
Bacterial
Growth
Kinetics
in
Activated
Sludge
Process,
Biomass
Mass
Balance
and
the
Substrate
Mass
Balance.
This
is
the
different
concepts
that
we
will
be
covering
the
bacterial
growth
kinetics,
biomass
mass
balance
assumptions
in
the
mass
balance
equation
and
also
the
substrate
mass
balance
to
start
with
like
you
know .
In
case
of
aerobic
bacterial
treatment
systems
and
all,
so
we
know
that
our
one
of
the
main
major
component
here
is
a
living
stuff.
It
is
a
bacteria,
it
is
a
type
of
either
bacteria,
protozoa
or
fungi
which
are
taking
the
lead
role
here
in
the
in
our
aerobic
treatment
systems.
So,
what
are
what
are
their
purposes,
what
they
do?
They
their
job
is
to
is
to
consume
the
oxidized
organic
matter
and
convert
it
into
either
carbon
dioxide,
bacterial
cell
biomass
or
to
release
the
ammonia.
If
you
see
this
equation,
equation
number
1
it
is
represents
this
CHONS
represents
the
a
say
like
a
organic
matter .
In
presence
of
oxygen
this
organic
matter
acts
like
a
electron
donor
and
oxygen
acts
like
a
electron
acceptor .
What
it
does?
It
in
it
converts
into
the
carbon
dioxide,
ammonia,
ammonium
ion,
water
and
some
new
bacterial
cell.
This
C
5
H
7
O
2
N
represents
a
new
bacterial
cell
ok.
So,
now
this
oxidation
and
the
synthesis
reaction
is
responsible
for
the
removal
of
biodegradable
organic
matter
from
the
wastewater
in
the
activated
sludge
process.
And
when
this
organic
matter
present
in
the
wastewater
is
depleted,
the
bacteria
is
also
flow
forced
to
go
for
endogenous
respiration.
So,
we
all
already
know
that
what
is
endogenous
respiration,
but
in
case
of
endogenous
respiration
the
cell
protoplasm
it
converts
into
the
elemental
it
like
started
breaking
down
and
convert
into
elemental
constituents
like
the
like
the
equation
you
can
see
in
the
equation
number
2.
C
5
H
2
O
2
N(113g)
+
5O
2
(160g)
→
CO
2
+
H
2
O
+
NH
3
Where
you
see
this
C
5
H
2
O
2
N
if
say
like
it
represents
a
cell
cell
biomass.
In
the
presence
of
oxygen
5
number
of
oxygen
molecule
it
what
is
happening
there?
It
converts
into
carbon
dioxide
H
2
O
and
ammonia.
So,
if
you
see
the
oxygen
requirement
here
for
113
gram
of
biodegradable
cell
mass
like
you
know
it
160
gram
of
oxygen
is
required
for
the
for
its
stabilization.
So,
stoichiometrically
speaking
the
relationship
tells
that
the
cellular
sludge
mass
required
at
oxygen
value
of
equal
to
1.42
milligram
of
oxygen
per
milligram
of
volatile
suspended
solid.
So,
just
160
by
1.113
you
will
get
this
value
ok.
So,
this
is
how
actually
this
representations
is
very
important
you
need
to
remember
this
thing
will
be
needing
it
later
on.
In
general
the
rate
of
biomass
increase
during
the
log
growth
phase
is
directly
proportional
to
the
initial
biomass
concentration
and
it
follows
the
strictly
the
first
order
equation
which
is
represented
in
equation
number
3
that
where
is
this
what
is
this
dx
by
dt
is
the
growth
rate
of
biomass
in
gram
per
meter
cube
per
day
and
µ
is
the
specific
growth
rate
in
per
day
and
x
is
the
biomass
concentration
in
gram
per
meter
cube
per
milligram
per
liter
ok.
This
biomass
concentration
this
capital
X
how
we
can
find
out
it
is
a
MLVSS
ok,
good.
So,
we
already
started
understanding
the
concepts
and
all.
So,
taking
into
account
the
endogenous
respiration
because
it
is
not
that
only
it
is
a
continuous
system
and
maybe
some
amount
of
biomass
is
also
taking
its
own
protoplasm
because
of
the
severity
of
the
say
like
substrate
what
it
does
it
consumes
some
amount
its
own
protoplasm
and
it
goes
through
the
endogenous
decay
process.
In
this
endogenous
decay
process
we
it
is
because
of
that
we
need
to
introduce
this
in
this
equation
3
as
well
and
it
convert
it
modified
to
equation
number
4
you
say
whereas,
this
Kd
is
the
endogenous
decay
coefficient
and
X
is
the
biomass
concentration.
And
in
case
of
in
general
the
wastewater
treatment
by
biological
means
depends
on
the
versatility
of
the
bacterial
metabolism
and
the
ability
of
microor ganisms
to
carry
out
the
metabolic
processes
at
very
low
concentration
of
substrate
in
an
aqueous
environment.
So,
and
we
already
know
what
is
stoichiometry .
So,
this
is
how
the
bacterial
growth
kinetics
in
case
of
log
growth
phase
works.
To
discuss
to
understand
further
as
the
maximum
bacterial
growth
takes
place
during
the
exponential
growth
phase
or
the
log
growth
phase
this
µ
is
equal
to
µ
max
when
the
ample
amount
of
substrate
is
available.
The
specific
growth
rate
in
operational
activated
sludge
process
will
never
be
equal
to
the
µ
x
µ
max,
but
it
because
it
depends
upon
the
substrate
concentration,
but
theoretically
its
maximum
in
case
of
exponential
growth
phase.
In
this
growth
condition
we
know
the
substrate
is
in
the
substrate
limited
growth
conditions
under
which
they
will
not
be
able
to
exhibit
the
maximum
growth
rate.
Monod
equation
actually
monod
scientist
monod's
equation
actually
gives
us
the
most
perfectly
pictured
expression
for
which
represents
this
specific
growth
rate
of
bacteria
as
a
function
of
the
substrate
utilization
which
can
be
represented
by
equation
number
5
you
see
the
.
So,
here
if
you
now
use
the
equation
number
4
represent
like
you
know
now
put
this
value
equation
number
5
and
equation
number
4
you
will
get
this
equation
number
6
Here
the
k
S
is
what
is
the
concentration
of
the
substrate
S
when
µ
is
equal
to
µ
×
2
ok.
It
is
represented
by
the
unit
of
milligram
per
liter
and
if
you
see
in
this
figure
the
specific
growth
rate
versus
limiting
substrate
concentration
you
see
the
at
whenever
the
µ
m
by
µ
m
is
equal
to
like
the
in
the
graph
when
the
in
the
specific
growth
rate
value
µ
value
is
µ
m
×
2
that
time
whatever
the
substrate
concentration
it
is
represented
by
the
k
S
ok.
So,
please
remember
that.
And
for
if
all
the
substrate
like
in
organic
matter
present
in
the
system
converted
to
biomass
then
the
substrate
utilization
rate
is
obviously ,
equal
to
the
biomass
growth
rate
whatever
the
substrate
is
utilized
it
converted
into
biomass.
So,
that
should
be
this
rate
should
be
same
the
substrate
utilization
rate
is
equal
to
biomass
growth
rate,
but
it
does
not
happen
it
never
happened.
Why
because
all
the
substrate
cannot
be
converted
into
biomass
because
energy
generation
from
the
oxidation
of
organic
matter
is
must
for
supporting
the
anabolic
reaction
the
biomass
synthesis
that
is
happening
in
case
of
in
case
of
biomass
growth
rate
in
that
in
that
part
of
in
that
part
of
it.
So,
because
of
the
this
biochemical
conversion
you
cannot
have
a
exact
value
of
substrate
left
for
converting
into
the
biomass
value
ok.
So,
there
will
be
certain
disproportions.
So,
in
general
that
is
why
we
introduce
the
cell
yield
coefficients
or
normally
this
value
is
less
than
1
because
that
means,
the
all
the
substrate
even
the
100
percent
of
the
substrate
is
convert
like
you
know
utilized
it
does
not
give
you
the
100
percent
conversion
into
a
cell
biomass
ok.
I
mean
like
you
cannot
you
cannot
do
it.
So,
because
of
that
this
yield
coefficient
value
is
less
than
1
and
it
this
correlation
can
be
defined
by
equation
7
the
whereas,
the
minus
dS
by
dt
if
you
replace
this
dS
by
dt
with
the
monod
equation
it
will
become
equation
number
8
Where
this
y
value
normally
varies
from
0.4
to
0.8
milligram
of
VSS
per
milligram
of
BOD
in
aerobic
biological
wastewater
treatment
systems.
Now ,
the
mean
cell
residence
time
which
we
all
know
what
it
is
like
you
know
we
already
had
a
discussion
about
it
that
total
mass
of
VSS
present
in
the
reactor
divided
by
the
VSS
that
we
are
wasting
from
the
system
per
daily
basis
ok.
So,
this
capital
X
divided
by
dx
by
dt
is
it
is
represented
by
the
value
of
theta
C.
If
you
now
substitute
this
value
in
equation
6
like
and
rearrange
it
the
you
will
get
the
equation
number
10
isn't
it
because
it
is
like
1
by
theta
C
is
equal
to
dx
by
dt
divided
by
x
and
dx
by
dt
if
you
replace
this
dx
by
dt
with
this
equation
with
the
equation
number
6
you
will
be
divided
by
x
you
will
get
rid
of
the
x
component
in
the
right
hand
side.
The
same
thing
you
can
see
in
the
equation
number
10
just
the
upside
down
ok.
Now ,
solving
this
equation
number
10
for
S
value
you
will
get
this
equation
number
11
and
which
actually
represents
the
which
by
this
equation
you
can
easily
calculate
or
estimate
the
effluent
soluble
BOD
if
you
all
the
other
parameters
are
known
to
you.
In
some
cases
in
certain
cases
this
S
value
is
significantly
less
than
the
Ks
and
in
that
case
this
Ks
plus
S
value
in
equation
number
10
in
the
denominator
it
is
nearly
Ks.
So,
hence
the
term
can
be
substituted
by
Ks
and
it
makes
this
equation
you
know
10
must
simplify
to
equation
12
as
in
the
special
case
you
see
1
by
theta
C
equal
to
µ
max
multiplied
by
S
by
Ks
minus
Kd
.
So,
this
is
how
like
you
know
your
simplified
version
of
the
equation
10
can
be
derived.
What
are
the
assumptions
that
we
normally
take
in
case
of
mass
balance
equation?
The
biomass
concentration
in
the
effluent
is
considered
negligible
that
means,
the
influent
that
is
coming
from
say
like
primary
treatment
unit
that
influent
should
not
be
having
any
biomass
theoretically
speaking
ok.
It
should
only
be
containing
the
organic
matter
which
needs
to
be
treated
in
the
aeration
time.
So,
whenever
we
go
we
did
this
substrate
mass
balance
or
the
biomass
balance
and
I
mean
like
the
mass
balance
equations
whenever
we
are
doing
it
we
have
to
make
sure
that
it
is
like
it
we
follow
this
particular
assumptions.
Substrate
concentration
in
the
influent
wastewater
is
considered
to
be
constant
that
means,
the
BOD
value
is
not
varying.
The
influent
BOD
value
should
be
the
same
for
the
design
purpose
ok.
The
waste
stabilization
is
considered
to
be
occur
in
the
aeration
tank
only.
There
is
no
further
aerobic
decomposition
happening
in
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank
theoretically ,
but
actually
speaking
there
is
good
amount
of
conversion
taking
place
in
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank
also
because
why?
Because
the
same
aerobic
bacteria
it
goes
along
with
the
wastewater
to
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank.
So,
there
you
are
letting
it
stay
for
couple
of
minute
hour
and
all
so,
that
it
will
settle
down.
So,
during
this
process
of
settling
also
it
will
still
search
for
food
and
it
will
actually
have
some
plenty
of
food
around
and
it
will
start
consuming
and
it
will
actually
settle
down.
While
settling
down
also
it
will
start
consuming
some
amount
of
organic
matter
in
the
system.
So,
theoretically
speaking
waste
stabilization
occurs
also
in
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank,
but
by
for
this
assumption
purpose
we
can
only
say
that
only
in
the
aeration
tank
waste
stabilization
is
taking
place.
There
is
no
microbial
degradation
of
organic
matter
happening
and
also
the
no
biomass
growth
is
happening
inside
the
secondary
clarifier .
Steady
state
condition
is
prevailing
and
the
volume
used
for
calculation
for
all
mean
cell
residence
time.
It
only
includes
the
volume
of
the
aeration
tank.
The
aeration
tank
volume
is
only
what
we
are
considering
for
calculating
the
mean
cell
residence
time
and
all.
So,
let
us
go
for
the
biomass
mass
balance.
A
mass
balance
for
the
microor ganisms
in
the
completely
mixed
reactor
in
the
figure
2
if
you
see
can
be
written
as
given
in
the
equation
number
13.
The
rate
at
which
the
biomass
enters
the
system
minus
the
rate
at
which
the
biomass
leaves
the
system
is
obviously ,
the
net
gain
the
net
rate
of
change
in
biomass
within
the
system
boundary
that
can
be
represented
in
the
figure
number
2.
If
you
see
in
the
figure
number
2
the
influent
wastewater
Q
0
,
S
0
and
X
0
.
What
is
Q
0
?
Q
0
is
the
inflow
rate.
S
0
is
what
here
the
substrate
concentration
and
the
BOD
say
X
0
is
the
biomass
concentration.
Theoretically
speaking
as
we
understand
from
the
assumptions
this
X
0
should
be
0.
It
should
be
it
should
not
be
having
any
value.
So,
I
mean
like
the
influent
wastewater
does
not
have
any
biomass.
Then
there
come
the
aeration
tank.
In
the
aeration
tank
you
have
a
volume
V,
S
is
the
inlet
biomass
like
you
know
their
organic
matter
present
in
the
system
and
X
is
the
biomass
concentration
or
the
MLVSS
of
the
aeration
tank.
This
is
a
very
important
element
this
capital
X.
Then
there
comes
the
X
0
+
X
R
.
So,
you
can
say
where
is
this
X
R
coming
sorry
Q
R
coming
Q
0
plus
Q
R.
Q
0
is
the
inlet
inflow
rate
and
Q
R
is
the
return
sludge
the
return
sludge
flow
rate
return
sludge
which
acts
which
will
come
into
the
picture
just
now
only
and
then
it
will
also
be
added
into
the
Q
0.
So,
now,
the
amount
of
waste
that
is
coming
from
treated
waste
coming
from
aeration
tank
to
the
secondary
sedimentation
tank
is
Q
0
plus
Q
into
Q
R
and
the
obviously ,
the
biomass
concentration
and
the
organic
matter
concentration
will
be
the
same
as
the
combination
as
the
aeration
tank
because
in
the
aeration
tank
we
are
providing
a
proper
mixing
condition
ok.
Then
it
come
then
it
comes
to
the
secondary
clarifier .
In
the
secondary
clarifier
theoretically
what
is
happening
there
the
clarification
takes
place
the
sedimentation
takes
place.
After
the
sedimentation
is
done
so,
what
will
happen
some
amount
of
sludge
is
we
are
wasting
the
Q
W
amount
of
sludge
we
are
wasting
which
has
a
organic
matter
concentration
of
S
and
the
say
like
the
biomass
concentration
is
X
X
R.
This
X
R
is
quite
huge
obviously ,
and
the
same
X
R
amount
of
the
biomass
concentration
is
there
in
case
of
return
sludge
also.
So,
in
the
return
sludge
the
Q
R
is
having
the
X
R
of
the
biomass
concentration
that
also
goes
back
to
the
aeration
tank
again
and
same
amount
of
effluent
we
are
releasing
we
are
collecting
or
the
as
a
from
the
supernatant
position
that
is
how
much
nothing,
but
the
Q
0
minus
Q
W.
So,
this
Q
0
minus
Q
W
amount
of
in
flow
rate
of
outflow
rate
we
are
getting
and
from
there
thevolume
of
sorry
the
amount
of
biomass
should
be
X
E
and
the
substrate
should
be
capital
S
that
same
S
value
only.
Now
this
X
E
according
to
our
assumption
this
X
E
value
should
be
also
0.
They
should
not
be
any
biomass
they
should
not
be
leaving
the
system
ok.
Theoretically
the
outflow
the
effluent
should
have
0
biomass
it
should
be
clean
of
any
biomass
it
should
only
be
having
some
amount
of
organic
matter
still
present
in
the
system,
but
it
should
not
be
having
any
the
cellular
biomass.
In
general
when
we
do
the
when
you
do
the
mass
balance
statement
analysis
we
follow
this
equation
14
C
inflow
of
biomass
plus
net
growth
of
biomass
minus
outflow
is
equal
to
the
accumulation.
Now
if
we
consider
steady
state
condition
there
should
not
be
any
accumulation.
So,
it
will
convert
into
equation
15.
So,
in
influent
biomass
plus
biomass
production
equal
to
effluent
biomass
plus
the
wasted
biomass
ok.
So,
this
is
the
final
equation
that
we
will
get.
If
you
now
convert
it
what
is
the
influent
biomass
according
to
this
here
picture
according
to
this
picture
in
the
figure
2.
Biomass
you
understand
the
influent
biomass
we
are
talking
about.
So,
influent
inlet
the
influent
flow
rate
what
is
the
flow
rate
here
q
0
multiplied
by
x
0
is
the
x
is
the
biomass
concentration.
If
you
multiplied
the
concentration
with
the
biomass
concentration
with
the
flow
rate
you
will
get
the
total
biomass.
So,
which
is
q
0
into
x
0
what
is
the
biomass
production
here?
Biomass
production
is
a
dx
by
dt
into
V,
V
is
the
volume
of
the
aeration
tank.
What
is
the
effluent
biomass
here?.
Now ,
theoretically
if
you
if
you
remember
according
to
our
assumption
our
influent
biomass
is
0
and
the
effluent
biomass
is
also
0
because
x
e
and
x
0
is
0
this
two
value.
That
means,
we
are
left
with
only
two
factors.
This
is
the
actual
final
equation
that
we
come
up
with
ok.
So,
now
this
V
dx
by
dt
this
dx
by
dt
if
you
replace
it
with
the
equation
number
17
it
will
become
this
as
shown
in
the
equation
18
and
if
you
rearrange
it
a
little
bit
it
will
become
q
it
will
become
equation
number
19
where
also
you
have
to
understand
that
r
dot
g
say
which
is
say
like
named
as
net
growth
of
microor ganisms
which
definitely
the
net
growth
how
we
can
say
the
net
growth
of
microor ganisms
the
waste
by
divided
by
the
volume
that
is
the
amount
of
extra
growth
that
is
happening.
So,
why
we
are
wasting
it
why
we
are
wasting
this
excess
microor ganism
right.
So,
excess
microor ganism
we
are
wasting
it.
So,
that
wasted
total
value
divided
by
the
volume
you
will
get
the
net
growth
of
microor ganisms
or
we
can
write
this
q
w
into
x
r
divided
by
V
into
x
or
R
g
dash
by
x
that
also
possible.
Now ,
can
you
remember
this
equation
does
it
remind
you
something
this
V
into
x
divided
by
q
w
into
x
r
is
nothing,
but
the
1
by
theta
I
mean
like
the
SRT
isn't
it.
So,
from
there
also
you
can
find
out
this
equal
to
R
g.
So,
it
is
like
x
by
R
g
dash
is
equal
to
theta
I
mean
like
the
SRT
also
you
can
get
out
anyway .
So,
in
another
word
this
R
g
dash
or
the
net
growth
of
microor ganisms
can
be
also
represented
by
minus
y
into
R
s
u
R
s
u
it
is
the
y
I
mean
like
you
remember
the
I
will
coefficient
and
the
R
s
u
is
a
substrate
utilization
rate
minus
K
d
into
x
you
remember
this
yeah
you
remember
this
equation
from
here
we
get
equation
number
7
So,
here
also
we
use
the
same
minus
like
minus
y
into
R
s
u
is
the
substrate
ds
by
dt
nothing,
but
ds
by
dt
minus
K
d
into
x
considering
the
endogenous
decay
value
and
from
this
equation
20
and
21
you
can
get
the
22
left
hand
side
is
nothing,
but
as
mentioned
in
the
equation
number
23
and
also
R
s
u
is
nothing,
but
the
substrate
utilization
rate
right
So,
that
is
this
theta
is
what
this
theta
is
the
hydraulic
retention
time
or
the
HRT
you
understand
and
what
is
this
theta
c
is
the
MCR T
or
the
sludge
retention
time.
So,
this
hydraulic
retention
time
from
there
you
can
get
the
R
s
u
value
and
now
we
can
easily
calculate
this
1
by
theta
c
from
equation
number
23.
If
you
use
the
equation
number
24
in
the
23
and
now
it
convert
into
like
if
it
will
reshuf fle
and
it
may
look
like
equation
number
25.
Now
if
you
do
some
more
solving
for
value
V
the
volume
of
the
reactor
aeration
tank
you
will
get
the
equation
number
26.
This
is
the
most
important
derivation
here
derivation
here
like
you
know
it
is
V
equal
to
q
into
theta
c
into
y
into
S
0
minus
S
divided
by
x
into
in
parenthesis
1
plus
K
d
into
theta
c.
So,
this
equation
actually
gives
us
an
estimation
of
the
volume
of
aeration
tank
when
the
kinetic
coefficients
are
known
to
us
ok.
This
is
very
important.
So,
the
F
in
the
and
the
flow
out
F
out
and
the
H
value
and
we
know
and
all
the
other
parameters
are
known
to
us
then
it
is
very
easy
for
us
to
find
out
the
volume
of
the
aeration
tank.
If
you
do
the
substrate
mass
balance
as
same
way
we
did
it
for
the
mass
balance
just
now
here
the
inflow
of
a
substrate
the
equal
minus
this
consumption
of
substrate
equal
to
the
outflow
substrate
plus
the
wasted
substrate.
So,
it
can
be
converted
into
the
equation
So,
from
there
if
you
reshuf fle
it
and
use
the
equation
number
8
the
monoid
equation
here
and
after
rearranging
you
will
get
the
final
the
equation
number
32
where
you
will
get
the
exact
the
you
will
get
the
value
of
S
ok.
The
substrate
concentration
inside
the
aeration
tank
which
can
be
easily
you
can
easily
get
by
this
equation
number
32
So,
with
this
equation
32
you
can
easily
get
an
idea
about
the
substrate
concentration
at
any
course
of
time
inside
your
aeration
tank
with
that
we
can
easily
find
out
the
value
volume
of
aeration
tank
that
it
requires
for
the
activated
sludge
process.
In
conclusion
we
understand
the
that
in
case
of
complexly
mix
activated
sludge
processes
different
kind
of
mass
balance
equations
are
needed
and
this
mass
balance
equations
are
actually
giving
us
exact
idea
the
design
information
about
what
should
be
the
criteria
for
microor ganism
or
cryo
microor ganisms
beneficial
microor ganisms
growth
what
should
be
the
volume
what
should
be
the
perfect
condition
we
can
provide
inside
the
aeration
tank.
So,
that
it
will
consume
the
maximum
amount
of
organic
matter
from
the
wastewater
possible
we
also
understand
the
stoichiometric
analysis
of
in
case
of
biodegradable
cell
mass
in
a
in
a
in
a
heterogeneous
decay
phase
we
understand
about
different
biomass
mass
balance
and
the
substrate
mass
balance.
These
are
the
references
that
you
can
follow
and
we
will
discuss
more
about
this
activated
sludge
process
in
the
coming
lecture
as
well
and
I
think
in
lecture
number
34
or
we
will
be
discussing
about
different
type
of
numerical
also
I
mean
like
different
numerical
sources
so
that
your
idea
will
be
much
more
clearer
I
mean
like
you
will
be
able
to
understand
the
whole
concept
in
a
much
nicer
way
perfect.
So,
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
for
the
day
we
will
see
you
in
the
next
class.
