Flocculation
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharwami
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering.
Today ,
we
will
be
continuing
with
the
module
5,
which
is
the
Physico-Chemical
Operations
and
Processes
part
2.
We
will
be
specifically
discussing
on
Flocculation
Processes,
we
will
be
discussing
on
the
different
mechanisms,
the
Perikynetic
and
the
Orthokinetic
Flocculation
Systems,
the
factors
which
affects
the
flocculation
and
different
design
considerations
and
also
we
will
solve
one
numerical
as
well.
So,
to
start
with
we
all
know
that
from
the
term
floc,
we
all
understand
that
what
is
floc,
it
is
like
you
know
and
conglomeration
of
some
objects
right.
Same
or
other
different
other
types
of
objects
can
conglomerate
together
and
we
can
call
it
a
floc.
So,
in
general
in
flocculation
process
what
we
do?
We
somehow
adds
by
means
of
by
mechanical
or
chemical
I
mean
like
by
unit
process
or
by
unit
operations
by
somehow
we
try
to
amalgamate,
we
try
to
you
know
conglomerate
couple
of
different
types
of
pollutants
or
same
type
of
pollutant
together
and
so
that
it
will
be
easier
for
us
to
get
rid
of
them
by
the
forces
of
gravity
it
will
settle
down
on
the
bottom
and
we
can
collect
it
as
a
sludge
ok.
So,
this
is
the
basic
fundamental
of
flocculation
process.
So,
in
this
flocculation
process
our
target
is
to
make
the
pollutant
to
cluster
together
agglomerate
and
form
larger
flocs
isn't
it.
As
you
can
see
in
the
picture
so
that
is
what
our
target
is
to
make
them
as
a
floc
like
structure.
What
are
the
different
mechanisms
that
involves
in
the
flocculation
systems?
The
first
one
is
the
perikinetic
flocculations
and
the
second
one
is
orthokinetic
flocculations.
The
first
one
in
general
like
the
in
the
first
stage
of
operation
happens
in
micro
scale.
In
micro
scale
flocculation
or
in
also
known
as
the
perikinetic
flocculations
what
happen
in
this
particular
case
different
inter
particle
they
collide
with
each
other
and
because
of
the
because
of
the
Brownian
motion
as
you
know
that
the
any
colloidal
particle
they
normally
have
a
behavior
they
normally
have
a
tendency
to
go
for
a
very
peculiar
path
of
motions.
So,
this
is
what
we
call
the
Brownian
motions.
This
Brownian
motions
because
of
that
they
collide
each
other
and
that
is
what
the
basic
principle
here.
So,
we
somehow
try
to
you
know
in
encourage
this
kind
of
collisions.
So,
in
this
kind
of
flocculation
systems
it
commences
immediately
after
the
destabilization
of
the
colloidal
particles
and
it
is
generally
driven
by
diffusion
process.
Aggregation
ofparticles
smaller
than
0.1
micron
diameter
it
occurs
during
the
perikinetic
flocculations
and
leading
to
a
formation
of
flocs
of
a
size
of
around
1
to
100
micron.
The
rate
of
change
of
concentration
of
this
colloidal
particles
in
suspension
with
respect
to
time
due
to
the
perikinetic
flocculations
can
be
denoted
as
J
B
as
you
can
see
and
it
is
estimated
by
using
this
equation
the
following
equation
ok.
𝐽𝐵=𝑑𝑐𝑑𝑡=−4η𝑘𝑇𝐶2
3µ  𝑆𝑜, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐶 𝑖𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑙
particle
in
suspension
at
any
particular
time
t.
The
collision
efficiency
factor
the
k
is
the
Boltzmann
constant
and
the
t
is
the
absolute
temperature
in
Kelvin.
The
next
stage
is
the
macro
scale
flocculation.
What
is
happening
in
the
initially
we
have
the
perikinetic
flocculations
or
the
micro
scale
now
we
are
having
the
macro
scale.
In
macro
scale
or
the
or
also
known
as
the
orthokinetic
flocculation
it
refers
to
a
phenomena
where
the
inter
particle
contacts
are
produced
by
laminar
or
turbulent
fluid
motions.
Here
we
target
normally
little
bit
higher
or
the
larger
sized
particles
like
in
greater
than
1
micron
and
it
normally
happen
due
to
the
process
of
eviction
or
the
bulk
motion
of
the
fluid.
We
normally
introduce
some
velocity
gradient
which
is
induced
in
flocculation
tank
by
via
slow
mixing
by
using
some
mixing
phenomena
mixing
maybe
it
can
be
some
orator
it
can
be
some
normal
mixture
it
can
be
vortex
generator .
So,
by
anyway
we
try
to
make
a
small
mixing
in
the
system
ok.
And
we
can
actually
provide
different
kind
of
mixture
also
we
can
provide
some
baffles
along
the
basin
that
also
kind
of
making
it
a
kind
of
a
the
mixing
possible.
Higher
velocity
gradient
in
general
it
increases
the
number
of
contacts
and
between
the
particles
and
leading
to
the
greater
quantity
of
floc
formulation
ok.
The
more
time
will
be
required
to
reach
the
optimum
floc
size
at
lower
velocity
gradient
owing
to
the
subsequent
reduction
in
the
number
of
contacts
between
the
particles.
Also
the
rate
of
reduction
in
the
concentration
of
colloidal
particle
with
time
which
is
expressed
by
J
G
can
be
expressed
using
the
following
equation.
Here
if
you
see
the
it
also
it
almost
follows
the
same
equation
as
the
perichyretic
flocculation,
but
only
with
the
additional
terms
like
d
which
denotes
the
diameter
of
the
colloidal
particle
and
gamma
this
the
velocity
gradient
of
the
laminar
flow.
The
negative
symbol
in
general
if
you
see
in
this
equation
we
have
a
negative
it
actually
used
before
to
account
for
the
decrease
in
the
concentration
of
the
particle
due
to
the
aggregation
with
time.
So,
what
are
the
different
factors
which
can
affect
the
flocculation?
First
of
all
the
concentration
of
the
colloidal
particle
in
the
waste
water ,
the
higher
the
concentration
of
the
colloidal
particle
more
opportunity
for
them
to
in
a
contact
with
each
other
and
agglomerate
and
form
the
floc.
Second
is
the
slow
mixing,
the
higher
mixing
intensity
in
flocculation
can
induce
a
shear
effect
and
it
may
actually
disintegrate
and
disperse
in
the
water
again.
So,
slow
mixing
is
more
important
ok.
The
intensity
of
mixing
is
very
important
here.
We
normally
denote
the
we
it
is
a
very
important
term
this
capital
G
if
you
can
see
here
the
temporal
mean
velocity
gradient
with
a
unit
of
second
inverse
normally
10
to
75
second
inverse
is
standard
like
in
general
we
takes
a
anyway .
So,
this
temporal
mean
velocity
gradient
is
normally
used
in
coagulation
and
flocculation
process
for
measuring
the
intensity
or
mixing
by
the
following
equation.
This
V
1
and
V
2
are
the
velocities
of
colloidal
particle
A
and
2
having
a
distance
of
x
in
between
them
ok.
So,
this
is
called
the
temporal
mean
velocity
gradient
or
with
the
G
ok.
So,
it
you
can
understand
it
has
a
unit
of
second
inverse
and
so,
this
is
very
important
please
remember
this
term
temporal
mean
velocity
gradient.
So,
we
need
this
value
we
need
this
notation
when
we
will
be
discussing
the
numerical.
In
general
the
mixing
basin
it
it
this
mixing
is
induced
by
creating
a
turbulence
by
as
I
was
mentioning
either
by
using
some
mechanical
or
the
mechanical
means
or
by
you
can
simply
put
some
baffles
as
you
can
see
in
this
picture
they
put
a
different
kind
of
baffle
walls
different
I
mean
like
like
5
number
of
baffle
walls.
Because
of
this
baffle
walls
this
inflow
it
reaches
it
creates
a
certain
turbulent
turbulence
and
because
of
that
what
this
mixing
is
happening.
So,
this
kind
of
mixing
can
be
either
called
like
I
mean
like
this
can
be
called
the
around
and
end
type
there
is
another
type
over
and
under
type
is
also
there.
So,
this
over
and
under
type
mixture
is
also
there
and
you
know
there
are
this
around
and
end
type
is
also
there.
So,
it
depends
upon
the
position
of
the
baffle
walls
in
the
either
it
is
a
horizontally
placed
or
the
vertically
placed
ok.
So,
and
also
the
mechanical
mixer
also
sometimes
we
use
like
radial
or
the
axial
axial
flow
impellers
with
shaft
and
pedal
arrangement
as
you
can
see
in
the
bottom
the
mechanical
mixer .
So,
those
are
slowly
they
are
moving
and
they
are
rotating
on
the
surface
either
vertically
or
the
horizontally
horizontally
placed.
So,
what
they
are
doing
they
are
making
a
certain
mixing
arrangement
inside
in
the
in
the
water .
So,
it
will
actually
encourage
the
flocculation
process
to
occur .
So,
what
are
the
base
major
factors
which
affects
the
flocculation?
The
first
one
is
the
mixing
time.
As
you
can
easily
understand
the
maybe
from
your
basic
understanding
we
can
say
that
you
know
the
more
the
mixing
time
the
more
the
better
the
system
right.
So,
it
was
not
only
it
is
that
that
is
not
the
only
factor
ok.
In
general
in
like
in
usual
wastewater
treatment
practices
the
mixing
time
required
for
flocculation
ranges
from
20
to
30
minute
to
ensure
the
proper
floc
formations.
Most
of
the
flocculation
tanks
are
designed
with
the
hydraulic
retention
time
t
considering
the
requisite
mixing
time
criteria.
Product
of
velocity
gradient
you
know
the
what
is
the
velocity
gradient
here?
The
velocity
gradient
it
is
like
you
know
dc
by
dt
or
dc
by
dx
here
I
would
say
like
you
know
dv
by
dx
here
ok.
So,
that
means,
the
velocity
in
terms
of
I
mean
like
in
terms
of
distance.
So,
because
of
that
it
has
a
what
will
be
the
unit
of
it
second
inverse
or
the
time
inverse
multiplied
by
the
hydraulic
retention
time
time.
So,
it
becomes
the
conjugation
opportunity
we
call
it
this
this
gt
it
has
it
is
a
dimension
less
than
ok
is
not
it
you
understand.
The
velocity
gradient
which
normally
it
is
like
you
know
having
a
second
inverse
the
unit
and
the
hydraulic
retention
time
if
you
multiply
it
will
become
unit
less.
So,
this
unit
less
this
term
conjugation
opportunity
what
we
call
it
gt
is
very
important.
It
is
normally
it
is
often
used
as
most
important
design
criteria
for
flocculation
tank.
So,
please
remember
this
term
gt
capital
gt
which
is
used
for
which
is
also
known
as
conjugation
opportunity
and
this
will
be
very
useful
for
us
to
understand
the
process
ok.
In
general
the
parameter
g
normally
directly
affects
the
density
of
the
flocs
whereas,
the
detention
time
t
is
responsible
for
the
determining
the
size
of
the
floc
formed
ok.
So,
remember
the
g
the
the
g
is
it
you
remember
the
g
we
discussed
about
in
the
temporal
mean
velocity
gradient
g
this
mean
velocity
gradient
is
actually
giving
us
an
idea
that
what
will
be
the
density
of
the
flocs
ok.
The
higher
the
g
the
higher
the
denser
the
floc
the
dense
the
floc
will
be.
However ,
the
lower
the
g
the
lighter
the
floc
will
be
ok.
As
you
can
see
in
the
and
also
it
depends
on
the
detention
time
also
if
the
t
is
less
that
means,
small
floc
formation
if
the
t
is
more
than
more
and
more
opportunity
for
the
this
pollutant
particles
colloidal
particles
you
know
agglomerate.
So,
the
size
will
be
larger.
So,
t
is
higher
is
already
known
to
us
the
t
if
it
is
high
then
the
size
of
the
floc
will
belarger
if
t
is
less
the
size
of
the
floc
will
be
small.
The
g
is
high
that
means,
it
is
a
dense
it
is
will
be
quite
dense
the
floc
as
the
if
the
g
is
low
then
the
it
will
be
quite
lighter
in
the
in
in
nature.
So,
based
on
that
if
you
see
in
the
picture
there
the
inflow
and
outflow
we
normally
design
it
in
asuch
a
way
that
we
add
multiple
mixer .
We
suppose
need
to
design
1
cubic
meter
of
flocculated
flocculation
tank.
What
we
do
we
divided
into
2
part
half
meter
cube
each
ok.
Then
in
the
first
mixer
what
we
do
we
do
it
in
a
little
bit
faster
mixing.
In
the
second
one
little
bit
slower
mixing
zone.
So,
because
of
this
faster
mixing
zone
what
is
happening
there
the
small
flocs,
but
more
dense
so
that
means,
more
amount
of
particles
can
get
agglomerate
there.
In
the
next
one
it
is
larger
floc
because
the
time
is
high,
but
what
what
is
happening
the
floc
sizes
larger,
but
there
is
a
chance
that
it
will
it
will
also
be
quite
denser
as
well
ok.
If
you
can
see
in
the
first
mixing
zone
what
is
happening
the
g
is
higher .
So,
the
g
once
the
g
is
higher
and
if
you
see
the
t
the
time
is
low.
So,
what
is
happening
here?
So,
because
of
the
higher
detention
time
I
mean
like
the
detention
time
is
less,
but
if
you
have
the
higher
like
the
g
value
is
high.
So,
because
of
that
what
will
happen
will
happen
in
denser
small
floc,
but
in
case
of
slow
mixing
zone
if
you
see
it
will
be
having
the
g
value
is
less
and
the
time
is
high.
So,
because
of
that
it
may
have
the
larger
flocs,
but
it
may
be
much
lighter
than
the
fast
mixing
zone
ok.
So,
this
is
the
basic
difference
between
these
two
ok.
So,
this
is
this
is
the
why
why
we
install
multiple
like
you
know
stack
of
mixer
and
we
divide
the
flocculation
chamber
in
couple
of
bifurcated
in
couple
of
different
zone.
So,
that
will
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
flocculation
process.
There
are
some
design
considerations
I
would
like
you
to
remember
the
first
thing
is
the
flocculators
are
normally
designed
for
a
peripheral
velocity
of
around
of
this
paddle
blades
in
the
range
of
0.1
to
0.9
meter
per
second.
The
relative
velocity
with
respect
to
the
adjoining
water
near
to
the
external
tip
of
the
paddle
is
maintained
below
1
meter
per
second
to
prevent
the
excessive
velocity
gradient
for
avoiding
the
disintegration
of
the
floc.
The
total
paddle
blade
you
know
the
paddle
wheel
when
we
use
it
this
paddle
blade
area
should
be
15
to
20
percent
and
or
like
you
know
10
to
15
percent
of
the
flocculation
basin
cross
section
basin
sectional
cross
sectional
area
based
on
the
the
the
Droste
gear
2018
and
the
CPHEU
manual
in
1999.
The
minimum
and
the
maximum
area
of
the
blade
should
be
10
percent
and
15
25
percent
for
sufficient
mixing
respectively .
The
depth
is
generally
3
to
3
4.5
meter
when
mechanical
mixers
are
installs
for
baffled
flocculators
depth
of
1.5
to
3
meter
is
ah
3
times
the
distance
ah
between
the
baffle
ah
with
a
minimum
distance
of
0.45
ah
meter
between
the
baffle
is
enough.
Hydrodynamic
retention
time
in
general
we
keep
it
around
10
to
30
minute.
So,
please
remember
the
value
of
g
t
the
value
of
g
t
we
ah
we
take
it
inthe
range
of
10
4
to
10
5
and
ah
based
on
the
CPHHU
recommend
they
recommends
the
this
value
should
be
somewhere
around
2
to
6
into
10
4
for
aluminum
coagulants
and
1
to
1.5
to
the
power
ah
10
5
for
ferric
coagulants
ok.
So,
ah
we
normally
take
the
aluminum
coagulants
only
in
general.
So,
for
that
we
take
the
value
of
5
to
6
into
10
4
that
is
a
standard
procedure.
So,
let
us
go
ahead
let
us
do
one
ah
numerical.
So,
it
will
be
you
know
ah
easier
for
us
to
understand
the
flocculation
chamber
and
how
it
is
to
be
design
and
the
whole
concept
in
details.
So,
in
this
question
it
is
asked
that
a
flocculation
basin
is
to
be
designed
to
handle
60
60
million
liter
per
day
MLD
60
million
liter
you
remember
million
liter
means
10
6
liter
per
day.
So,
10
6
means
liter
means
10
3
meter
cube
day
means
divided
by
886400
it
will
be
easily
converted
into
meter
cube
per
second
ok
we
may
need
that
value
anyway .
So,
60
million
liter
per
day
of
waste
water
flow
ah
for
this
particular
flocculation
basin
has
to
be
designed.
The
basin
should
have
4
compartments
each
equipped
with
a
vertical
mechanical
mixture
with
a
shaft
and
paddle
arrangement
having
a
motor
and
brake
efficiency
of
90
percent
and
75
percent
respectively .
The
shafts
are
to
be
fixed
horizontally
at
mid
depth
along
the
width
of
the
tank
perfect
has
and
has
a
gradually
varying
g
to
provide
tapered
flocculation
as
your
as
you
remember
I
was
telling
it
will
vary
with
time
the
faster
mixing
then
the
little
bit
slower
then
little
bit
slower
at
the
end
it
will
be
the
slowest
one
ok.
And
the
kinematic
viscosity
of
the
water
ah
is
given
as
1.31×
10
−6
m
2
/sec
ok.
If
you
want
to
convert
into
dynamic
viscosity
simply
you
multiply
it
with
the
ah
density
ok
so,
which
is
1000
kg
per
meter
cube
you
know .
So,
ah
in
general
the
you
are
asked
to
to
calculate
the
dimension
of
the
flocculator
the
power
required
for
driving
each
mixer
the
rpm
of
paddle
wheel
etcetera.
We
first
is
they
also
ask
that
please
provide
2
flocculators
operating
in
parallel
and
2
power
blades
per
ah
power
wheel
for
with
one
on
either
of
the
arm
ok
with
a
coefficient
of
drag
CD
as
1.8
and
depth
to
width
ratio
of
the
flocculator
as
1
ok.
So,
these
are
the
information
that
is
ah
given
to
us.
So,
what
we
need
to
do
the
first
thing
that
we
need
to
do
let
us
take
some
assumptions.
The
step
one
is
since
the
flocculation
basin
should
have
the
4
component
with
the
varying
g
value
you
take
the
different
g
value
standard
practice
is.
So,
take
like
60
second
inverse
it
should
be
minus
1
ok
please
correct
it
those
should
be
minus
1
60
second
inverse
in
the
first
compartment
then
the
next
one
is
45
second
inverse
the
next
one
will
be
the
30
ah
second
inverse
and
the
fourth
one
will
be
say
like
15
second
inverse.
So,
how
we
can
get
the
ah
average
ah
g
average
now?
So,
60
plus
45
plus
30
plus
15
divided
by
4
that
is
37.5
second
inverse
say
that
is
the
g
average
for
you.
Now ,
you
assume
the
g
t
value
if
you
remember
we
say
that
g
t
value
in
generated
by
CPHHU
CPHEU
manual
that
ah
they
recommend
that
g
tvalue
should
be
somewhere
around
2
to
6
into
10
4
for
aluminium
coagulants
ok.
So,
this
g
t
value
is
so,
we
have
taken
for
this
problem
6
into
10
4
ah
and
as
you
have
as
you
remember
it
is
unit
less
is
not
it
because
it
is
a
product
the
multiplication
of
velocity
gradient
into
hydraulic
retention
time.
So,
this
ah
the
g
t
value
we
know
the
we
already
assume
that
6
into
10
to
the
power
4
and
also
the
the
g
average
is
also
known
to
us
the
velocity
gradient
is
also
known
to
us
ok.
So,
which
is
given
as
ah
37.5.
So,
we
can
easily
calculate
the
ah
detention
time
because
detention
time
is
nothing,
but
the
detention
time
or
hydraulic
retention
time
whatever
it
is
it
is
it
is
it
is
the
same
is
the
nothing,
but
the
you
can
easily
find
out
by
conservation
opportunity
divided
by
the
velocity
gradient.
So,
the
velocity
gradient
is
known
to
us
37.5
and
that
we
also
know
the
g
t
value.
So,
g
t
divided
by
velocity
gradient
you
will
get
the
retention
time,
hydraulic
retention
time
or
the
retention
time.
So,
hydraulic
retention
time
is
come
over
6
into
10
to
the
power
4
divided
by
37.5
equal
to
26.67
minute
or
say
let
us
let
us
say
27
minute.
So,
the
volume
of
the
flocculator
how
you
can
calculate
the
volume
of
the
flocculator
just
try
to
understand.
So,
there
is
a
certain
inflow
there
suppose
there
is
a
one
chamber
you
design
one
small
tank.
So,
in
this
tank
there
is
a
say
100
meter
cube
per
hour
inflow
is
coming
ok.
So,
you
know
that
you
only
want
your
the
water
the
the
the
detention
time
of
your
reactor
should
be
half
an
hour
ok.
So,
what
will
be
the
volume?
So,
for
half
an
hour
your
I
mean
like
you
know
the
100
meter
cube
per
hour
is
the
inflow
rate.
So,
for
in
half
an
hour
what
will
be
the
total
inflow
100
into
0.5
that
is
0.5
50
meter
cube.
So,
50
meter
cube
should
be
your
should
be
the
volume
of
your
reactor
reactor
same
way
we
can
also
design
the
volume
of
flocculator
also.
How
because
we
know
the
inflow
which
is
60
into
10
to
the
power
6
that
is
that
much
of
million
liter
that
much
liter
divided
by
10
to
the
power
3
it
will
become
meter
cube
divided
by
60
divided
by
24
it
will
become
in
minute
and
the
as
the
detention
time
we
already
know
the
27
minute.
So,
if
you
multiply
that
this
this
much
of
this
value
in
the
left
multiplied
by
27
minute
you
will
get
the
total
volume
of
the
flocculator
you
need
ok
which
is
coming
as
1
1
2
5
meter
cube.
Now ,
there
are
2
flocculator
that
we
need.
So,
each
floc
each
tank
should
have
a
volume
of
562.5
meter
cube.
Now
we
know
that
the
the
depth
to
width
ratio
is
1.
So,
if
you
take
a
depth
of
4.5
meter
in
general
that
is
the
standard
practice
for
mechanical
if
you
see
it
is
given
in
the
yes
if
you
can
see
the
fourth
point
the
depth
is
generally
3
to
4.5
meter
when
mechanical
mixtures
are
installed
ok.
So,
4.5
is
a
standard
practice.
So,
we
will
take
a
depth
of
4.5
meter
including
0.5
meter
of
free
board
on
the
top
in
case
of
you
know
over
spilling
and
to
reduce
to
reduce
thechances
of
over
spilling
or
not.
So,
total
depth
will
be
5
meter
and
as
you
know
the
depth
to
width
depth
to
width
ratio
is
1.
So,
that
means,
if
you
are
taking
depth
as
4
4
4.5
meter
your
width
will
also
be
4.5
meter .
So,
now,
you
know
the
width
4.5
meter
you
know
the
depth.
So,
what
will
be
the
length?
Because
we
know
length
into
breadth
into
depth
is
equal
to
the
volume
the
volume
is
562.5.
So,
how
you
can
find
out
the
length
562.5
divided
by
4.5
into
4.5
is
not
it.
So,
this
way
the
value
is
coming
as
27.78
meter
or
28
meter .
So,
that
means,
this
is
the
length
total
length.
So,
now,
they
are
asking
you
to
divide
the
whole
flocculator
into
4
chamber
4
compartment.
So,
each
compartment
will
be
having
a
length
of
7
meter
28
divided
by
4
7
meter
each
ok.
So,
the
each
compartment
having
a
dimension
of
4.5
meter
×
4.5
meter
×
7
meter
ok.
So,
that
is
the
dimension
of
the
easily
you
can
find
out.
Now ,
again
the
value
of
g
or
the
like
if
you
want
to
find
out
the
value
power
requirement
it
can
be
easily
find
out
by
the
following
the
equation
that
is
given
here.
𝐺=𝑝µ𝑉
So,
here
if
you
see
this
dynamic
viscosity
you
need
to
find
out
first
the
dynamic
viscosity
or
mu
this
value
you
can
easily
find
out
kinematic
viscosity
is
given
multiplied
by
the
density
1000
meter
1000
kg
per
meter
cube.
So,
it
will
you
can
easily
find
out
the
kg
per
meter
per
second
you
can
see
the
first
point
So,
earlier
the
so,
your
the
unit
will
become
kg
by
meter
per
second
ok
kg
per
meter
per
second.
Now ,
the
the
next
is
the
the
volume
volume
we
know
volume
what
is
the
volume
4.5
by
4.5
by
7
ok.
So,
also
we
need
to
find
out
the
g
g
value
for
the
first
chamber
what
is
the
g
value
g
1
60
second
inverse
remember .
So,
this
will
become
67
inverse.
So,
60
second
inverse
that
also
the
value
should
be
in
like
it
should
be
square
the
value.
So,
you
will
get
the
value
of
power
requirement
to
be
as
to
be
990.36
watt.
Same
way
for
the
next
one
you
put
the
value
the
the
dynamic
viscosity
1.31
into
10
to
the
power
minus
6
into
10
to
the
power
3
kg
per
meter
kg
per
meter
per
second
multiplied
by
4.5
by
4.5
by
7
meter
cube
multiplied
by
30
because
g
45
g
2
value
is
45
45
second
inverse.
So,
g
square.
So,
45
second
inverse
square
all
square
divided
by
0.9
into
0.75
what
is
this
0.9
into
0.75
if
you
remember
in
the
question
it
is
given
that
the
the
efficiency
see
the
motor
efficiency
and
the
brake
efficiency
is
given.
So,
once
you
know
the
motor
efficiency
and
the
brake
efficiency
you
will
be
able
to
understand
you
will
be
able
to
calculate
the
exact
power
that
is
required
ok
removing
the
the
considering
the
efficiency
of
the
of
your
motor
and
the
brake
as
well.
So,
if
you
divided
by
0.9
divided
by
0.75
you
will
get
the
actual
power
requirement
ok.
So,
for
the
first
one
you
need
990
watt,
second
one
557
watt,
third
one
247
watt
and
the
fourth
one
61.9
watt.
So,
likewise
this
is
the
power
requirement
for
your
aerator .
So,
this
is
how
we
normally
we
go
ahead
with
the
designing
different
the
aerator
flocculation
systems
and
all.
I
would
still
suggest
like
you
know
once
you
go
through
it
go
through
this
lecture
material
once
more
to
understand
it
more
in
a
to
you
know
kind
of
imbibity
you
know
in
your
brain
plus
you
go
through
some
literatures
and
where
it
will
be
more
easier
for
you
to
know
just
simply
search
for
in
Google
that
a
design
of
different
flocculation
chamber
and
go
through
the
different
scholarly
articles.
It
will
be
very
good
for
you
to
understand
this
you
know
important
design
thing
is
and
all
ok
very
good.
So,
I
you
can
see
in
the
top
this
is
how
we
will
be
designing
the
flocculation
chamber
will
look
like
with
a
individual
mixing
system
with
you
know
paddle
wheel
paddle
wheel
mixture.
So,
one
wheel
on
the
both
the
side
ok
on
the
other
side
of
the
arm
I
would
say
ok.
So,
in
general
we
in
this
particular
lecture
we
understand
the
mechanism
the
influencing
factors
and
the
design
considerations
of
flocculations
which
is
essential
for
optimizing
the
wastewater
treatment
processes
and
ensuring
the
effective
removal
of
contaminants.
We
understand
about
the
perikinetic
flocculation
driven
by
the
Brownian
motion
and
also
orthokinetic
flocculation
induced
by
the
fluid
motion
play
a
distinct
role
in
the
formation
of
the
flocs.
We
also
understand
the
concentration
of
the
colloidal
particles
slow
mixing
and
intensity
of
mixing
are
one
of
the
key
factors
which
influence
the
flocculation
systems.
So,
this
is
a
very
important
you
need
to
understand
this
basic
funda
because
the
most
of
the
questions
will
be
asked
from
your
basic
understanding
of
the
subject
only
ok.
The
control
mixing
particularly
in
flocculation
tank
is
crucial
to
prevent
the
disintegration
and
ensure
the
effective
floc
formation
and
proper
design
considerations
as
we
just
did
for
flocculators
include
the
peripheral
velocity
of
the
paddle
blade,
relative
velocity
and
the
hydraulic
retention
time
is
very
important
for
us
to
understand
when
we
design
a
flocculation
chamber
of
the
flocculators
ok.
So,
we
will
be
continuing
with
the
different
other
types
of
flocculation
systems
in
the
coming
lecture.
So,
this
is
the
different
references
I
would
really
request
to
go
through
each
one
of
this
ok.
And
we
will
discuss
more
in
more
about
the
flocculation
systems
in
the
coming
lecture
and
we
will
be
concluding
the
primary
treatment
units
in
the
coming
lecture
as
well.
And
I
hope
you
will
get
to
know
more
I
mean
like
more
in
details
about
how
this
flocculation
different
other
types
of
flocculation
chamber
works
and
all
ok.
Thank
you
so
much
for
the
time
being.
See
you
in
the
next
lecture.
