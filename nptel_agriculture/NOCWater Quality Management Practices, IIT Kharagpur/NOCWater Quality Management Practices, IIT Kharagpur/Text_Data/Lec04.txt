Environmental
Legislation
&
Regulatory
Standards
Hello
everyone,
welcome
to
this
NPTEL
online
certification
course
on
Water
Quality
Management
Practices.
My
name
is
Gaurav ,
Professor
Gaurav
Dharbhumik.
I
am
from
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
of
the
Indian
Institute
of
Technology
Kharagpur .
So,
as
I
was
discussing
like
continuing
to
the
to
my
previous
discussion
in
my
previous
lecture
module,
if
you
remember
that
the
introductory
sessions
like
whenever
we
will
be
discussing
on
the
pollutants,
whenever
we
were
discussing
about
the
type
of
emer ging
contaminants
in
our
last
lecture
also,
we
were
always
focusing
on
the
safe
limit,
we
were
always
focusing
on
what
is
the
regulatory
standard.
Whenever
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
safe
limit
and
regulatory
standard,
who
do
you
think
is
having
that
ultimate
say
ultimate
you
know
the
capacity
of
the
I
mean
like
the
bodies
who
can
actually
regulate,
who
can
actually
say
that
which
is
the
safe
limit
for
my
country ,
which
is
the
safe
limit
for
this
country
or
which
is
the
safe
limit
for
this
state,
which
is
the
safe
limit
for
the
other
state.
It
always
governed
by
some
regulatory
body
right,
which
is
coming
those
are
the
policymakers.
In
a
bigger
scale
in
a
worldwide
manner ,
we
have
different
bodies
governed
by
the
United
Nations
majorly
like
WHO
World
Health
Organization.
They
have
their
own
limit
that
they
have
set
for
different
issues,
different
contaminations,
different
kind
of
human
health
hazards,
different
case
of
ecosystem
health
hazards
and
all.
Likewise
say
like
you
take
a
example
of
USA,
USA
has
its
own
agency
right,
USA
is
a
environmental
production
agencies
and
all.
If
you
consider
about
India,
we
have
central
pollution
control
board,
we
have
national
green
tribunal
NGT .
So,
the
what
the
recently
there
is
this
Namame
Ganga
mission
also
coming
up,
where
people
are
trying
to
where
the
policymakers
I
mean
like
the
where
we
are
trying
to
rejuvenate
the
Ganges
river
right.
So,
the
pollution
that
it
occurred
that
is
occurring
there,
I
mean
trying
to
rejuvenate
somehow .
So,
and
based
on
that
there
is
a
committee
being
set
up,
there
is
a
proper
regulatory
body
that
set
up
under
the
Namame
Ganga
mission.
So,
they
also
made
certain
limitations,
certain
standards,
certain
regulatory
limit
or
bar
at
which
only
that
that
has
to
be
maintained
by
all
the
citizens,
all
the
industrials
or
industrial
people
like
you
know
industries,
municipality
whatever
is
lying
on
that
stretch,
on
that
particular
district,
on
that
particular
state
or
on
that
particular
country .
So,
that
has
to
be
maintained.
So,
whenever
we
talk
about
any
standard,
whenever
we
talk
about
any
pollutant,
we
talk
about
in
number
right
that
this
much
is
the
number
of
or
the
presence
of
pollutant
that
is
there
in
the
waste
water ,
that
is
there
in
the
water
and
this
is
the
number
or
this
is
the
setlimit
that
has
to
be
reached
by
us
in
order
to
call
it
a
safe
limit
or
the
it
is
coming
under
the
regulatory
bodies
concerned
or
it
will
not
come
under
the
regulatory
bodies
concerned.
So,
what
will
happen?
You
may
be
ah
fined,
you
may
be
put
behind
the
bar
even
the
prison,
if
you
are
not
following
those
order
or
the
limit
set
by
the
this
regulatory
bodies.
So,
we
will
majorly
discussing
about
this
only
in
this
lecture
that
ah
different
environmental
legislation
and
the
regulatory
standard
that
it
presents
in
the
ah
ah
in
this
kind
of
waste
water
or
the
water
treatment
scenarios
and
all
ok.
So,
majorly
the
water
related
environmental
legislations
will
be
discussing
in
detail.
The
quality
standards
for
sewage
treatment
plant
effluent
ah
dischar ge,
the
stringent
sewage
dischar ge
limit
or
the
standards
set
by
ah
the
central
pollution
control
board
ah
national
green
tribunal
for
Indian
mega
and
metro
cities,
the
global
consistency
enforcement
and
the
monitoring
mechanism.
If
we
start
with
the
say
like
water
related
environmental
legislation
for
controlling
the
treated
sewage
dischar ge,
unit
European
Union,
EU,
ah
United
States
of
America
and
India
some
of
this
some
of
this
ah
numbers
sometimes
they
may
match.
What
are
these
numbers?
This
BOD,
TSS,
COD,
ANP ,
you
you
already
have
some
idea
right
that
these
are
some
of
the
ways
some
of
the
units
that
we
need
to
take
into
consideration
whenever
we
say
this
water
is
polluted,
this
water
is
not.
These
are
the
some
qualitative
or
the
and
quantitative
parameters
by
which
actually
we
can
say
that
this
water
is
not
drinkable,
this
water
is
not
good
for
agriculture
uses,
this
water
is
not
good
for
ah
household
purposes
or
this
water
is
not
good
for
industrial
purposes.
So,
some
water
if
parameter
wise
it
is
somehow
ranking
as
a
good
water
good
quality
water
for
industrial
uses
that
does
not
give
you
any
indication
that
it
is
good
for
your
drinking
purpose.
For
them
the
set
standards
are
completely
different
ok.
So,
in
general
if
you
see
the
when
we
discuss
we
have
some
quality
standard
and
we
have
some
ah
dischar ge
ah
regulations
that
has
to
be
balanced.
If
you
are
not
balancing
these
things
what
will
happen
we
will
unnecessarily
creating
the
problem
to
the
environment
creating
problem
to
the
surface
water
that
we
are
dischar ging
the
water
on.
Majorly
the
BOD
biochemical
oxygen
demand
if
you
remember
we
discussed
and
we
will
be
discussing
in
details
in
coming
module
that
to
not
only
to
define
it,
but
also
to
model
it
and
we
to
know
that
how
the
BOD
is
somehow
related
to
the
COD,
TOC
and
all
these
things.
This
BOD
limit
it
is
actually
give
you
a
kind
of
a
indication
of
the
presence
of
biologically
degrade
like
some
organic
matter
which
can
be
degraded
biologically
from
the
system
ah
which
is
coming
which
has
to
be
well
within
the
25
milligram
per
liter
or
25
ppm
per
per
million
you
know
this
is
the
same
the
the
the
I
mean
like
ah
unit
wise
these
are
synonymous.
Then
the
TSS
total
suspended
solid
to
discuss
about
the
suspended
solid
you
need
to
first
understand
the
solid
right.Suppose
in
the
water
we
have
some
solid
content
with
the
total
solid
content
that
if
we
can
find
out
we
call
it
total
solid.
Total
solid
is
bifurcated
into
two
part
total
dissolved
one
or
we
call
it
total
dissolved
solid
and
total
suspended
solid.
This
total
dissolved
solid
and
suspended
solid
can
further
be
divided
into
another
two
parts
based
on
the
presence
of
volatile
compound
present
there
majorly
the
biological
matter
that
can
be
easily
volatilized
at
the
presence
of
500
600
degree
Celsius.
And
because
of
that
whatever
will
remain
that
will
whatever
will
remain
if
you
can
subtract
it
with
the
totals
ah
suspended
solid
or
total
dissolved
solid
we
can
get
the
total
volatile
suspended
solid
or
total
volatile
dissolved
solid.
So,
first
solid
then
dissolved
solid
and
ah
suspended
solid
then
each
of
them
can
be
divided
into
two
parts
one
of
them
that
total
volatile
solid
is
another
very
important
that
can
be
easily
found
out
from
the
fraction
from
the
from
this
ah
experiment
we
call
it
volatile
suspended
solid
experiment
and
all
ok
VSS
experiment
which
normally
is
nothing,
but
we
use
some
crucibles
where
we
know
once
we
know
the
TSS
we
use
that
same
like
with
the
we
once
we
know
the
TSS
that
ah
we
weigh
it
down
in
a
filter
paper
and
put
it
in
a
white
crucibles
and
then
we
put
it
in
the
muffle
furnace
for
say
like
couple
of
hour
ah
say
for
550
to
600
degree
Celsius
then
we
take
it
out
and
whatever
will
be
vaporized
ah
volatilized
and
we
will
just
final
weight
we
will
get
it
we
will
ah
substrate
it
from
the
initial
weight
and
we
will
get
the
volatilized
substrate
ah
solid
concentration
from
there
ok
anyway .
So,
we
will
discuss
about
all
these
things
in
detail
in
the
coming
lecture
that
how
we
can
actually
find
out
the
solid
content
in
your
wastewater
system.
Then
there
comes
a
COD
this
is
a
chemical
oxygen
demand
it
is
a
it
actually
indicates
you
the
presence
of
biological
as
well
as
chemical
ah
particles
or
the
chemical
ah
stuffs
which
are
actually
being
responsible
for
the
reduction
in
the
oxygen
level
to
what
level
to
what
is
the
final
oxygen
demand
because
of
the
presence
of
those
chemicals
to
be
to
oxidize
to
some
other
product
and
also
to
presence
of
some
say
ah
ah
the
organic
ah
say
the
living
organisms
of
the
say
biological
matter
which
can
also
needs
which
needs
also
some
oxygen
from
the
system
which
and
to
convert
into
a
sub
some
by
product.
So,
at
the
end
the
COD
it
is
giving
us
the
whole
picture
the
the
presence
that
oxygen
demand
because
of
the
chemical
as
well
as
the
biological
ah
matter
whereas,
by
BOD
it
gives
us
the
only
indication
of
the
presence
of
the
most
of
the
cases
carbonaceous
BOD
when
we
talk
about
it
gives
us
the
carbonaceous
organic
matter
present
in
your
system.
Sometimes
we
can
extend
the
BOD
period
and
we
can
get
the
nitrogenous
ah
organic
matter
also,
but
it
is
not
the
the
standard
it
is
not
coming
under
standard
procedure.
Standard
procedure
is
up
to
5
days
ah
20
degree
Celsius
or
in
Indian
context
we
go
ahead
with
the
27
degree
Celsius
for
3
days
BOD
calculation.
There
we
can
only
get
an
idea
about
the
organic
matter
present
in
your
system.
Anyway
so,
ah
the
the
we
will
discuss
about
it
in
more
detail
in
the
coming
module.
So,
otherthan
that
what
are
the
other
pollutants
major
pollutants
is
the
nitrogen
and
the
phosphorous.
So,
this
nitrogen
is
also
having
different
constituents.
Majorly
when
we
talk
about
the
nitrogen
ah
waste
we
talk
about
in
terms
of
if
it
is
a
waste
water
we
talk
about
in
terms
of
the
TKN
total
geldal
nitrogen.
So,
what
is
this
geldal
nitrogen?
Geldal
nitrogen
is
the
combination
of
organic
nitrogen
plus
the
ammoniacal
nitrogen.
What
are
the
other
type
of
nitrogen
that
can
be
also
present
in
the
waste
water
is
the
inorganic
nitrogen.
What
are
those?
Nitrate
nitrate
etcetera.
So,
this
nitrate
and
nitrate
it
comes
under
the
inorganic
nitrogen
whereas,
the
organic
nitrogen
and
plus
the
ammoniacal
nitrogen
this
comes
under
the
category
of
TKN
total
geldal
nitrogen.
So,
total
geldal
nitrogen
is
ah
in
ppm
in
per
or
in
milligram
per
liter
is
of
our
great
concern
and
we
normally
discuss
about
that
whenever
ah
any
regulatory
standard
is
given
to
you
ok.
What
are
the
importance
of
this
legislations?
The
protecting
the
water
bodies
and
the
aquatic
ecosystems
definitely ,
ensuring
the
public
health
and
safety
because
that
waste
water
where
you
are
dischar ging
your
waste
whether
it
be
whether
it
will
be
having
a
municipality
whether
it
will
be
having
say
like
your
industry
that
waste
can
actually
cause
a
drastic
harm
to
the
system
ok.
It
also
ensure
the
ecosystems
ah
preservation
that
it
will
not
damage
the
ecosystem
because
if
you
are
somehow
pouring
excess
amount
of
polluted
water
in
a
certain
ecosystem
aquatic
ecosystem
ah
per
say
what
it
will
happen?
It
will
change
the
whole
scenario
it
will
change
the
whole
ah
the
the
flora
and
fauna
that
can
easily
thrive
in
that
systems.
It
will
change
its
ah
complete
ratio
it
will
it
may
change
the
ah
type
of
organisms
also
that
is
present
in
your
systems
type
of
organisms
that
can
sustain
in
your
system.
So,
in
general
the
preservation
of
in
order
to
preserve
the
ecosystems
we
have
to
have
a
very
strong
legislation.
Sustainable
resource
management
if
we
have
a
proper
legislation
it
will
be
easier
for
us
to
reduce
the
ah
additional
resources
that
it
may
require
for
treating
those
excess
ah
amount
of
waste
in
the
ah
downstream
line
rather
than
in
the
upstream
only
during
the
x
a
during
the
ah
when
you
when
the
effluent
is
coming
in
contact
with
the
surface
water
body
even
if
you
can
treat
it
before
that
that
is
much
better .
Then
to
throw
it
in
the
surface
water
body
when
it
mixed
mixed
with
a
huge
water
system
it
you
cannot
when
you
want
to
do
it
at
the
later
stage
it
will
cost
you
more
than
if
you
can
do
it
in
the
in
situ
water
treatment
you
understand.
So,
resource
management
is
something
very
important
and
that
is
in
order
to
have
a
sustainable
resource
management
this
kind
of
legislations
are
necessary .
Economic
awareness
to
let
people
understood
ah
the
vanity
of
the
situation
that
they
should
understand
that
the
throwing
ah
say
like
you
know
ah
I
will
be
you
know
criticized
maybe
for
that
what
I
am
saying
right
now
even
the
most
of
the
labs
the
chemical
lab
that
is
there
in
the
most
of
the
institutions
that
alsohas
to
be
very
much
aware
of
what
they
are
doing.
Why?
Suppose
this
awareness
is
required
in
those
chemical
labs
in
what
they
what
they
are
doing
we
are
doing
a
lot
of
researches
and
all
after
then
we
will
simply
final
water
or
whatever
it
is
we
will
just
simply
throw
it
into
the
drainage
system
simply
throwing
into
the
our
basin
not
all
the
institutions
are
doing
it,
but
there
are
some
institutions
which
does
not
have
the
awareness
of
the
the
vanity
of
the
situation
that
what
kind
of
huge
ah
like
you
know
issue
that
they
are
creating.
Most
of
the
R
and
D
institutions
whether
it
be
institute
whether
it
be
in
industry
in
the
institutions
or
government
body
this
R
and
D
institutions
has
to
be
very
much
aware
of
the
waste
water
that
they
are
creating
out
of
their
system
out
of
their
building
out
of
their
ah
premises
that
has
to
be
treated
in
situ
because
otherwise
in
one
way
you
are
trying
to
help
the
society
at
the
same
time
you
are
creating
more
nuisance.
So,
this
is
the
awareness
level
that
has
to
be
developed
in
public
that
ah
what
exactly
is
the
sustainable
way
of
treating
stuff
sustainable
way
of
dealing
the
pollutant
all
the
same
things
has
to
be
well
discussed
well
ah
aware
by
I
mean
like
people
should
be
aware
of
all
this
things
and
the
legal
accountability .
If
you
see
the
industries
they
they
can
go
ahead
with
once
they
have
a
lot
of
money
they
they
can
think
it
is
ok
we
can
create
a
nuisance
in
the
system
it
is
not
of
our
problem
I
mean
like
if
there
is
someone
will
ask
you
for
you
know
say
something
and
they
will
like
you
know
ok
I
will
give
you
money
that
is
it
more
than
enough
no
you
have
to
have
a
legally
accountable
for
that
it
is
not
only
money
it
is
also
about
that
the
harm
that
you
are
causing
to
the
system.
It
is
not
only
the
big
units
sometimes
I
mean
the
small
units
small
ah
this
MSM
is
the
medium
and
small
ah
and
small
industries
and
all
they
also
do
this
entrepreneurs
they
are
also
doing
this
kind
of
nuisance
to
the
systems
because
they
consider
it
is
in
a
very
small
amount.
Just
imagine
this
small
amounts
one
after
another
thousands
of
people
if
they
are
doing
it
ah
cumulatively
they
are
creating
a
huge
nuisance
to
the
surface
water
body
where
this
wastewater
is
actually
at
the
end
it
will
reach.
So,
what
ah
this
regulatory
body
can
do
they
will
have
their
they
have
they
will
ah
right
they
will
have
their
legislations
which
is
which
will
definitely
ah
provide
them
all
the
power
to
actually
act
on
those
people
and
actually
give
them
a
enough
fine
or
let
them
liable
for
any
kind
of
disruptions
any
kind
of
issues
that
may
happen
because
of
the
ah
the
willing
full
like
you
know
dischar ge
or
you
know
their
purpose
full
dischar ge
of
ah
on
the
pollutant
polluted
water
into
the
surface
water
bodies
for
here
other
for
ah
in
the
surface
in
a
in
a
normal
uses.
The
quality
standards
for
sewage
treatment
plant
effluent
dischar ge
ah
it
actually
varies
as
I
was
discussing
at
the
beginning
from
country
to
country
the
state
to
state
even
from
district
to
district.
A
comparative
analysis
on
the
guidelines
ah
for
identifying
the
best
available
technologies
in
wastewater
management
systems
are
properly
ah
shown
by
the
UP
EPA
the
Environmental
Protection
Regencies
2010
and
also
ah
Ghanurag
at
all2022's
paper
you
can
follow
those
ah
site
I
mean
like
the
resources
those
are
very
useful
and
there
it
is
very
clearly
mentioned
that
how
this
different
BATs
I
mean
the
best
available
technologies
are
available
for
I
mean
like
can
made
available
for
ah
what
type
of
pollutant
and
what
type
of
ah
treatment
systems
that
we
are
targeting
and
what
is
the
legislation
ah
requirement
what
is
the
I
mean
like
the
regulatory
requirement
for
ah
your
ah
in
your
locality .
So,
in
general
if
you
see
the
EPS
the
United
States
Environmental
Protection
Regencies
2010
they
have
this
BOD
limit
of
ah
around
30
milligram
per
liter
and
TSS
ah
limit
of
around
30
milligram
per
liter
as
well.
It
should
be
less
than
that
this
final
dischar ge
ah
from
your
ah
municipal
system
municipality
wastewater
sewage
treatment
ah
plant.
However
it
ah
varies
to
place
to
place
in
Indian
environmental
protection
amendment
rules
2017
it
says
that
in
the
metro
cities
and
state
capitals
the
BOD
should
be
as
less
as
only
20
and
TSS
can
be
50
milligram
per
liter.
The
best
available
technologies
which
is
not
available
for
BOD
less
than
ah
20
milligram
per
liter
it
is
applicable
for
30
to
say
like
100
ah
milligram
per
liter
as
of
now
based
on
the
European
Union's
legislation
ah.
Other
than
that
in
India
we
have
this
national
green
tribunal
NGT
and
this
NGT's
NGT's
suggestion
or
their
regulations
BOD
should
be
as
low
as
only
10
milligram
per
liter
and
COD
should
be
50
milligram
per
liter
and
fecal
coliform
should
be
less
than
500
most
probable
number
per
100
ml.
That
means,
the
in
100
ml
of
wastewater
there
is
a
chances
of
maximum
like
on
an
average
100
number
of
presence
of
this
fecal
coliforms
in
the
wastewater .
So,
that
is
the
limit
set
by
the
national
green
tribunal
ah
of
India.
So,
it
actually
varies
with
the
place
to
place.
So,
many
nations
have
adopted
similar
global
commitments
for
sewage
dischar ge
and
this
global
global
efforts
are
actually
necessary
to
you
know
reduce
any
kind
of
ambiguity
that
is
present
because
some
of
the
ah
water
bodies
are
shared
between
two
or
more
countries
you
know
even
two
or
more
continents
also
there
are
two
continents
there
are
also
examples
of
such
water
bodies.
So,
in
that
case
suppose
one
water
body
suppose
in
say
one
example
the
Brahmaputra
river
which
is
coming
from
say
like
China
and
it
will
go
through
say
like
India
and
then
it
will
reach
at
some
point
in
Bangladesh.
So,
all
these
cases
in
three
different
country
has
its
three
different
regulations.
So,
you
have
to
have
some
global
effort
set.
So,
that
the
water
that
that
once
it
will
receive
to
the
second
country
or
the
third
country
it
will
be
of
same
category
it
will
be
of
still
safeguard
having
safeguard
measures
taken
by
the
first
country
or
the
second
country .
So,
that
your
follow
up
country
will
not
face
substantial
issue
or
the
resource
constraint
to
treat
that
wastewater
or
treat
that
water
to
you
know
ah
for
to
feed
their
ah
citizen
you
understand
right.
So,
this
is
why
the
global
consistency
and
the
collective
commitments
are
required.
So,
how
we
can
ah
do
that
we
can
have
a
international
agreements.
We
can
have
a
technology
transfer
between
the
industries
in
between
the
countries.
So,
somecountries
suppose
in
the
first
country
from
which
actually
the
in
the
water
is
coming
they
suppose
ah
suppose
they
do
not
have
those
technologies
or
the
resources
available
with
them
to
treat
the
water
to
it
the
effluent
or
that
sewage
coming
out
of
the
city
or
the
industries
to
a
level
that
it
will
be
make
usable
for
the
second
country .
So,
what
second
country
can
do
they
can
actually
ah
share
some
of
their
technology
which
are
readily
available
with
them
to
the
first
country .
So,
that
the
water
which
is
coming
from
them
to
the
second
country
will
not
be
of
a
affecting
through
them
it
is
like
you
know
for
their
mutual
benefit.
Collective
initiatives
they
should
have
they
should
both
take
some
initiative.
So,
that
they
can
ah
come
up
with
some
stringent
regulatory
standard
that
has
to
be
followed
by
all
the
industries
and
the
municipal
municipalities
present
in
the
neighboring
I
mean
like
the
shore
area
of
that
river
which
is
shared
by
both
the
countries.
Bilateral
and
multilateral
aid,
environmental
organization
has
to
be
also
involved
in
it.
So,
to
help
them
with
the
understanding
the
facts
in
more
details.
Data
and
research
sharing
which
I
was
ah
discussing
along
with
the
technology
transfer
data
and
research
sharing
is
also
important.
So,
that
you
will
let
them
know
that
how
the
overall
commitment
is
required
how
global
consistency
has
to
be
maintained
or
this
multilateral
consistency
has
to
be
maintained.
So,
that
ah
some
people
will
somehow
may
forget
or
somehow
may
you
know
miss
ah
I
mean
like
somehow
bypassed
ah
the
data
and
somehow
they
they
create
a
huge
amount
of
nuisance
to
the
follow
up
system
and
follow
up
unit
and
in
the
downstream
region
ah
can
be
affected
because
of
that.
Ah
harmonized
standard
has
to
be
set
by
all
these
countries
both
the
countries
or
more
than
1,
2
countries
if
they
are
involved
in
this
bilateral
or
try
multilateral
strategies.
And
so,
all
these
things
are
one
of
the
major
ah
you
know
initiatives
that
is
nowadays
become
ah
really
like
we
should
be
univocal
on
these
things
that
we
all
should
actually
come
up
with
this
collective
endeavors
which
involves
different
nations
organizations
and
communities
worldwide
ah
to
actually
come
up
with
this
global
effort
to
protect
the
water
quality
present
in
the
systems
and
all
and
then
it
is
recently
all
water
assessment
program
by
United
Nations
in
2006
actually
are
trying
to
come
up
with
this
global
ah
initiatives
of
such.
What
are
the
challenges
ah
challenges
that
ah
is
there
in
implementing
and
complying
with
this
sewage
dischar ge
regulations?
Ah
I
as
I
was
discussing
in
the
last
day
also
remember
we
that
ah
it
is
not
only
that
ah
you
being
a
policy
maker
you
just
give
a
very
strong
ah
you
know
standard
you
set
a
very
strong
and
stringent
standard
and
you
are
compelling
your
ah
all
the
companies
or
the
industry
to
follow
that.
Suppose
all
of
a
sudden
you
set
a
standard
just
to
give
you
an
example
say
like
BOD
should
not
be
less
than
ah
there
should
not
be
any
BOD
I
mean
like
say
like
5
I
mean
let
us
say
5
million
per
liter
or
0.
You
come
up
with
these
ideas
that
is
bestpossible
combination
best
possible
option,
but
that
does
not
make
sense
that
your
industry
has
the
capacity
they
industry
suppose
they
are
earning
in
ah
very
minute
amount
if
I
say
a
very
tiny
fraction
of
their
actual
revenue
and
in
order
to
clean
the
water
they
will
actually
become
loss
ah
making
industry .
So,
you
cannot
just
simply
implement
this
kind
of
ah
strict
very
stringent
actions
or
the
regulations
unless
until
you
know
that
what
is
the
standard
of
this
company
whether
they
will
be
able
to
ah
pick
it
up
or
not
and
if
not
then
you
give
some
subsidy
you
give
some
at
use
provide
as
a
government
or
as
a
policy
makers
you
provide
those
ah
help
and
ah
the
the
solutions
to
the
company .
So,
this
financial
constant
you
have
to
make
sure
that
the
your
policy
document
has
ah
made
it
clear
that
if
some
people
who
is
actually
poor
who
is
actually
coming
into
the
category
that
if
they
will
add
this
water
treatment
technologies
and
all
it
will
end
up
making
their
industry
become
ah
not
feasible
not
you
know
I
mean
like
useful
for
them
to
earn
some
good
money .
So,
what
you
can
do
in
those
cases
you
as
a
as
a
policy
maker
as
a
the
government
should
come
forward
and
the
this
regulatory
body
should
come
forward
and
suggest
them
some
alternative
ways
of
doing
it.
So,
that
the
those
employment
will
also
retain
the
people
will
get
their
employment
at
the
same
time
the
environmental
standards
can
also
be
set
ah
well
set
I
mean
like
the
you
will
not
harm
the
environment
at
all.
Technological
barrier
the
the
major
problem
is
the
lack
of
expertise
in
the
this
modern
facilities
that
is
available.
So,
this
modern
treatment
plant
or
the
design
that
will
be
discussing
with
you
I
am
100
percent
sure
very
few
of
them
actually
knew
about
this
technologies
before
had
though
you
are
having
the
same
water
even
while
maybe
having
this
discussion
like
having
watching
this
lecture
you
are
drinking
the
water
without
even
knowing
that
where
this
water
is
coming
from.
You
need
to
understand
this
this
is
very
important
we
need
to
be
water
educated
like
you
know
why
we
as
nowadays
people
call
energy
educated
people
water
educated
or
environment
educated
this
has
to
be
this
three
has
to
be
the
pillar
of
any
education
systems
that
water
education
environment
education
energy
education.
Even
before
like
you
know
passing
the
class
12
for
the
graduation
you
need
to
be
having
this
three
education
for
sure.
So,
that
you
will
know
your
environment
better
you
know
your
ah
like
in
the
situation
that
is
surrounding
that
the
places
that
you
are
where
the
you
are
at
the
about
the
environment
much
better
way.
So,
this
water
which
is
coming
to
your
ah
glass
it
has
to
pass
through
a
several
kilometers
of
water
distribution
line
before
that
it
was
there
in
a
water
treatment
unit
before
that
it
was
there
in
a
it
was
freely
roaming
from
freely
roaming
in
a
surface
water
body
right.
So,
from
the
surface
water
body
you
ah
suck
the
water
from
it
you
have
a
water
treatment
line
which
treat
that
water
and
then
it
will
ah
supply
to
you
in
your
households
right
and
then
you
are
very
happy
you
just
go
and
open
the
tap
you
have
the
water
either
you
put
it
again
one
aqua
guts
have
one
small
aqua
gut
and
you
are
confident
enough
that
your
water
is
good
enough
for
you
to
drink.You
need
to
understand
the
technology
it
is
very
important.
So,
that
is
the
main
purpose
of
this
subject
that
you
need
to
understand
that
what
you
are
drinking
you
need
to
understand
that
what
about
the
waste
water
that
you
are
creating
what
is
the
fate
of
it
what
is
happening
to
that
waste
water
that
waste
water
at
the
end
it
comes
to
the
surface
water
and
that
same
surface
water
you
are
drinking
the
water
right.
So,
that
is
a
circle.
So,
this
circle
you
have
to
understand
it
better
for
you
to
ah
you
know
influence
the
policy
makers
of
your
place
or
for
you
to
influence
your
children
your
neighbor
your
like
you
know
the
the
the
relatives
everyone
to
aware
of
the
the
the
vanity
of
the
situation
that
that
you
need
to
know
that
how
the
water
and
waste
water
been
treated
and
why
it
is
of
our
utmost
important
for
us
to
understand
it.
So,
this
technological
barrier
is
there
because
of
our
unwillingness
and
sometimes
even
we
do
not
have
to
do
it
we
because
of
our
other
involvement
and
all,
but
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
understand
this
basics
ok.
Maintenance
and
the
operations
the
negligence
leads
to
the
non
compliance
we
neglect
some
of
the
times
the
regulatory
bodies
come
up
with
some
ah
good
ah
you
know
ah
standards
and
the
set
their
regulation
sets
and
set
some
standards
and
all,
but
we
normally
try
to
avoid
this
we
do
not
care
about
this
is
negligence
is
very
important
and
because
of
the
maintenance
of
your
treatment
units
operations
ah
operational
um
the
I
mean
like
the
economic
involvement
that
it
requires.
So,
we
have
to
somehow
make
an
optimized
system
political
factors.
So,
ah
we
normally
try
to
avoid
this
discussions
when
we
have
in
scientific
ah
situation
scientific
ah
ah
you
know
discussions
the
political
factors
are
very
important
where
people
of
ah
certain
ah
I
mean
like
you
know
certain
section
sometimes
may
ah
try
to
implement
some
new
thingy
some
new
technology
or
something,
but
the
other
sections
seems
like
you
know
they
are
not
interested
in
it
because
like
definitely
because
if
the
system
will
be
installed
the
the
water
will
be
purified
the
the
energy
will
be
ah
less
ah
costly
and
it
may
actually
people
will
be
more
you
know
prone
to
you
know
giving
vote
to
a
certain
political
parties.
So,
other
political
party
may
not
be
influenced
with
that
and
somehow
try
to
jeopardize,
somehow
try
to
convince
people
I
did
no
no
no
that
that
energy
that
type
of
system
is
actually
works
only
that
treatment
plant
will
does
not
do
anything
at
the
end
it
will
ah
reduce
the
quality
of
water
that
we
are
having
as
of
now.
So,
do
not
worry
see
I
am
also
drinking
the
water
from
the
system
you
can
also
do
it.
So,
they
will
do
it
in
front
of
everyone
they
will
have
the
glass
full
of
water
they
are
drinking
and
they
will
consider
you
they
will
say
like
ok.
So,
this
is
see
if
I
can
do
it
you
can
also
do
it
you
do
not
remember
for
the
next
couple
of
days
there
may
be
he
is
hospitalized
or
may
be
you
know
he
will
be
using
some
other
form
of
water
after
words
like
he
will
never
use
that
water
anymore.
So,
just
to
make
the
ah
you
know
discussion
a
little
bit
lighter
I
am
discussing
this
thing.
So,
this
is
political
factor
that
actually
is
veryimportant
for
you
it
is
your
responsibility
to
actually
deter
from
this
influences.
Community
resistance
land
and
natural
resources
definitely
sometimes
the
community
resistance
is
there
because
sometimes
the
waste
water
like
in
Singapore
ah
most
of
their
water
that
they
are
drinking
it
is
coming
out
of
the
urine
that
they
are
ah
I
mean
like
from
their
waste
water
only.
So,
they
have
the
acceptance
key
ok.
So,
from
urine
if
you
have
a
proper
systems
you
can
treat
that
water
and
at
the
end
you
can
have
that
water
drinkable
enough.
However ,
if
you
say
the
same
to
your
local
community
and
they
will
say
like
no
no
way
I
am
going
to
do
that.
If
people
know
that
the
waste
water
is
being
used
for
treating
the
that
the
the
waste
water
is
being
treated
and
then
same
same
water
is
supplied
no
one
will
drink
that
water .
However ,
if
you
are
not
told
about
anything
actually
this
is
something
that
is
what
is
being
done
most
of
the
cases
the
same
waste
water
is
going
to
the
surface
water
bodies
just
after
a
couple
of
meter
away
there
will
be
another
or
couple
of
hundred
meter
away
there
will
be
another
ah
suction
line
from
where
the
water
is
being
collected
from
where
this
water
is
coming
the
same
waste
water
that
you
are
dumping
ok.
In
in
the
many
of
cases
it
may
happen
that
same
waste
water
that
you
are
dumping
you
are
again
sucking
that
water
only
pumping
ah
pumping
out
the
water
from
the
surface
water
body
for
to
the
and
throwing
like
you
know
somehow
treating
it
in
your
water
treatment
plant
and
then
you
supplied
to
your
ah
drinking
water
systems.
But
if
once
people
do
not
know
they
will
definitely
have
it.
It
is
it
is
same
like
we
go
to
the
vendor
unless
we
do
not
know
how
they
are
preparing
the
food
we
are
completely
ok
with
that.
So,
something
like
that.
So,
this
community
resistance
is
something
very
important.
Rapid
urbanization
the
escalated
demand
of
the
demand
it
outspaces
the
available
facilities.
So,
you
do
not
have
the
facilities
suppose
when
you
are
in
New
York
or
you
are
in
New
Delhi
or
say
suppose
somewhere
in
Shanghai
or
Beijing.
So,
you
do
not
have
the
capacity
you
do
not
have
the
land
available
for
a
water
treatment
plant
because
there
are
scarcity
of
land
for
even
human
being
to
settle
the
there
because
of
the
ah
rapid
urbanization
and
all.
So,
to
there
the
land
footprint
is
very
important
and
the
water
treatment
and
all
this
becomes
a
secondary
issue.
Industrial
and
agricultural
dischar ges
because
those
are
non
point
sources
very
hard
for
you
to
actually
I
mean
like
you
know
identify
I
mean
especially
I
would
say
like
you
know
you
you
should
have
a
very
stringent
ah
policies
at
place
in
order
to
tackle
this
agricultural
dischar ge
to
be
precise
if
I
say
because
this
is
the
agricultural
runof f
are
very
hard
to
you
know
find
out
in
a
certain
level
because
what
you
can
do
ah
it
will
it
may
sometimes
leach
through
the
surface
it
is
some
leach
through
the
soil
and
it
can
actually
ah
reach
to
groundwater .
It
can
also
go
ahead
with
the
surface
runof f
phenomena
during
the
rainy
season
it
can
comein
contact
with
the
storm
water
diet
ended
systems
and
then
it
will
come
to
your
treatment
plant
as
well.
So,
which
is
also
something
challenging
and
also
changing
environmental
conditions
unusual
weather
circumstances
weather
circumstances
is
one
of
the
major
challenge
for
even
treating
the
sewage
itself
you
know .
Enforcement
mechanism
regulatory
authorities
are
there
they
have
to
use
the
tools
and
the
strategies
to
monitor
control
and
also
if
possible
penalize
the
entities
that
fail
to
add
to
this
regulations.
What
are
the
tools
and
strategies
you
can
have
the
civil
and
criminal
liability
for
non
compliance
and
deliberate
violation
against
the
rules
of
the
standards
that
ah
is
set
by
the
regulatory
body
of
your
country .
Permitting
and
the
licensing
this
it
is
it
you
need
you
can
only
get
to
ah
start
your
industries
once
you
have
the
permit
or
the
license
that
you
have
ah
you
are
maintaining
the
dischar ge
limit
you
are
maintaining
the
ah
the
quality
of
your
ah
that
water
the
that
is
effluent
that
is
coming
out
of
your
systems.
Inspections
regular
inspections
has
to
be
there
ah
schedule
or
unannounced
some
random
inspection
has
to
be
there
to
make
sure
that
those
industries
or
those
ah
regular
I
mean
like
those
municipalities
are
actually
complying
to
the
regulations
set
by
those
ah
regulatory
bodies.
Penalties
and
fines
has
to
be
imposed
on
a
very
ah
strict
manner
without
any
delay
when
if
someone
consider
this
is
a
this
is
not
of
a
big
important
and
you
just
can
throw
n
number
of
chemicals
in
the
waste
water
whenever
you
feel
like.
It
is
very
dangerous
you
just
realize
that
if
someone
will
like
in
a
spit
on
your
waste
spit
on
your
the
water
that
you
are
drinking
and
you
are
considering
it
is
ok
it
is
ok
it
is
completely
ok
you
cannot
be
ok
with
that
it
is
very
dangerous
it
is
it
is
very
heinous
job
that
this
industries
those
municipalities
that
they
are
doing.
So,
you
have
to
be
vocal
and
you
have
to
be
going
to
your
policy
makers
and
have
to
ask
them
that
whether
they
are
actually
treating
the
waste
water
that
is
coming
out
of
your
city
or
not
before
dischar ging
into
the
surface
water
bodies.
So,
once
you
have
this
voice
then
only
it
is
possible
for
ah
you
know
ah
for
the
regulatory
bodies
for
the
sorry
policy
makers
to
start
implementing
the
penalties
and
fines
in
a
very
regular
manner .
So,
that
they
will
not
do
this
kind
of
heinous
job
then
this
sampling
and
analysis
is
very
important
for
giving
them
the
certification
that
their
industries
complying
with
the
regulatory
standard.
The
major
purpose
to
deter
the
non
compliance
of
this
institute
this
industries
and
the
municipality
ah
municipalities
and
to
encourage
the
proactive
pollution
control
and
to
protect
the
water
quality
which
is
our
utmost
important.
Monitoring
procedures
ah
monitoring
procedures
are
essential
for
accessing
and
the
ensuring
the
compliance
with
the
sewage
dischar ge
regulations
definitely
and
also
our
procedures
involve
the
systematic
data
collection
analysis
and
the
reporting
to
evaluate
the
quality
of
dischar ge
effluent.
It
can
be
done
ah
in
by
different
procedures
first
of
all
the
periodic
sampling.
Itis
the
ah
it
is
specific
to
individual
water
parameters
and
you
have
to
take
the
sample
periodically
and
you
have
to
ah
make
a
proper
chart
and
a
proper
excel
sheet
where
you
will
be
reporting
it
to
your
industry .
Suppose
you
you
are
a
environmental
manager
of
a
particular
industry
or
you
are
a
environmental
manager
or
the
environmental
ah
like
a
person
who
will
be
taking
care
of
the
issues
related
to
the
environment
for
your
municipality
you
have
to
make
a
note
of
all
the
ah
like
you
know
say
regulatory
standards
and
that
you
set
I
mean
like
the
that
is
set
for
your
ah
industry
or
for
your
city.
Then
there
comes
a
continuous
monitoring
real
time
monitoring
systems
nowadays
the
in
technology
has
improved
like
anything.
So,
we
have
online
monitoring
systems
OMS.
So,
online
monitoring
system
is
nothing,
but
you
set
certain
probes
and
the
electrodes
in
the
system.
So,
by
which
you
can
actually
get
the
real
time
data
and
that
real
time
data
is
actually
it
is
there
are
some
Wi-Fi
chips
or
sometimes
there
are
some
sim
card
also
attached
to
the
design
only.
So,
and
the
algorithm
is
means
submit
such
a
way
that
it
will
be
it
will
directly
providing
the
real
time
data
to
your
ah
say
whatever
graphical
interface
that
you
have
made
in
that
GUI
the
data
will
be
transferred
and
from
there
you
can
get
what
is
the
actual
pH
value
actual
DO
value
dissolved
oxygen
actual
ah
say
like
salinity
of
your
ah
salinity
or
say
like
alkalinity
I
mean
like
say
oxygen
reduction
potential
ammonia
nitrate.
So,
all
these
things
you
can
easily
get
it
a
COD
BOD
you
can
get
it
in
a
ah
online
monitoring
systems
in
a
one
single
screen.
So,
that
screen
can
be
shared
with
the
regulatory
body
also
say
like
in
Indian
case
suppose
you
are
one
industry
and
that
industry
ah
whatever
the
regulatory
ah
standard
is
there
I
mean
like
it
is
maintaining
or
not
that
should
be
shared
with
the
ah
say
like
in
Delhi
they
have
their
higher
office
it
is
shared.
So,
they
got
to
know
that
that
industry
is
actually
having
all
of
a
sudden
a
higher
peak
of
certain
components
or
not
all
these
things
can
be
easily
ah
affirmed.
Then
there
is
third
party
verification
sometimes
what
happen
independent
consultant
and
auditing
firms
are
asked
ah
sometimes
most
of
the
cases
what
happened
there
are
some
like
in
India
case
there
are
IITs
NITs
there
are
there
are
some
institutions
ah
of
eminence
where
they
are
asked
to
they
are
asked
to
requested
by
the
regulatory
bodies
to
go
and
visit
those
industries
for
a
surprise
surprise
visit
and
to
go
and
take
some
sample
and
talk
to
them
whether
they
are
actually
maintaining
the
water
quality
that
is
set
for
them
or
not.
So,
we
suppose
we
go
there
and
we
take
the
sample
and
we
do
the
analysis
in
our
lab
and
we
inform
the
say
like
central
body
as
a
third
party
that
ok.
So,
whatever
report
ah
we
are
giving
you.
So,
this
is
actually
and
whatever
report
that
you
have
given
about
that
industry
is
actually
kind
of
true
and
we
are
verifying
it
and
in
case
it
is
not
matching
we
will
say
like
no
it
is
not
verifying
there
needs
to
be
further
inspection
and
it
needs
to
be
dealt
very
strictly .
Then
you
have
to
do
the
environmentalimpact
assessment
study
water
quality
aquatic
or
ecosystem
health
to
understand
all
these
things
and
also
data
management
and
the
reporting
is
very
important
the
documentation
is
very
important
ah
I
would
say
in
this
all
these
cases.
The
major
purpose
is
to
detect
the
deviations
from
the
established
standard
taking
the
timely
corrective
actions
and
identifying
the
trend
by
which
we
can
say
that
ah
this
is
the
trend
and
slowly
some
peak
or
some
hike
in
the
ah
some
pollutant
is
ah
establishing
or
we
can
witness.
So,
please
work
on
these
things
in
your
industry
or
in
your
municipality
there
is
a
chance
some
industry
or
some
people
are
actually
throwing
those
excess
ah
polluted
water
into
the
systems
that
can
be
very
harmful
for
the
people
who
is
using
it
in
a
downstream
region.
In
conclusion
our
discussion
I
hope
you
understand
the
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
ah
it
actually
this
discussion
actually
underscore
the
global
significance
of
water
related
environmental
legislation
in
controlling
treated
sewage
dischar ge
majorly
highlighting
the
importance
of
stringent
quality
standards
for
sewage
treatment
to
preserve
water
quality ,
protect
the
ecosystems
and
ensure
the
public
health.
Also
we
discuss
about
the
significance
of
water
related
environmental
legislation
for
controlling
the
treated
sewage
dischar ge
and
its
crucial
role
in
safeguarding
our
environment
public
health
and
long
term
sustainability
of
water
resources
and
all.
The
focus
on
stringent
ah
sewage
ah
ah
dischar ge
standards
in
for
Indian
mega
and
metro
cities
were
also
emphasized
and
ongoing
efforts
to
enhance
the
environmental
protection
emphasizes
the
need
of
ah
comprehensive
sewage
management
systems
for
rapidly
growing
urban
areas
were
also
discussed.
So,
I
hope
you
have
a
very
good
pictures,
skew
picture
like
you
know
scenery
you
can
see
the
scenery
how
the
treatment
ah
systems
are
actually
working
this
and
how
the
legislation
units
are
ah
prescribing
the
standard
they
and
then
this
standard
how
they
are
maintained
and
who
are
this
third
party
people
and
also
how
this
ah
ah
regulatory
bodies
are
actually
at
the
end
come
up
with
this
idea
of
you
know
how
different
kind
of
legislation
to
safeguard
the
environment
and
all
ok.
So,
I
hope
ah
the
this
discussion
actually
ah
give
you
give
you
some
ah
additional
knowledge
in
this
respect
and
these
are
the
references
and
we
will
see
you
in
the
next
lecture.
Thank
you
so
much.
