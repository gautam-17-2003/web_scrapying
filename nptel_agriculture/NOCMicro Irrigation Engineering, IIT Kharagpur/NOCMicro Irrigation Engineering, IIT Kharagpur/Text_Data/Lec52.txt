Automation of Micr o Irrigation System (Part - 2)
Hello
participants,
I
am
now
starting
the
new
aspects
of
this
particular
course,
it
is
a
lecture
52,
and
of
course
it
is
in
continuation
to
my
previous
lecture
on
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
one
component
of
this
particular
lecture,
it
was
discussed
in
lecture
51.
In
this
particular
lecture,
we
are
discussing
about
different
components
of
automated
micro
irrigation
system.
In
which
different
sensors,
controllers,
actuators
they
are
the
part
of
the
components which we will discuss these topics in detail in this lecture.
In
previous
lecture
51,
we
discussed
about
why
to
automate
micro
irrigation
system,
we
discussed
about
role
of
ICT
and
IoT
in
automating
micro
irrigation
system.
There
are
different
types
of
micro
irrigation
automation
systems,
this
also
we
discussed
and
then
whether
parameter ,
soil
parameters
which
are
considered
while
we
are
automating
the
irrigation system. So, we discussed on these points.
In
this
lecture
we
will
be
talking
about
components
of
automated
micro
irrigation
system,
these
components
are
sensors,
controllers,
actuators,
network
wired
or
wireless
or
without
wire
system
or
data
communication
and
software
controller
program,
database,
graphical
user
interface.
My
lecture
will
be
limited
to
sensor ,
controller
and
actuators.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture, we will be talking more detail about the sensors, controllers and actuators.
So,
to
automize
micro
irrigation
system,
as
I
told
you
it
involves
set
of
sensors,
these
sensors
could
be
of
different
category
maybe
we
are
using
weather
sensor
data,
maybe
we
are
using
the
pressure
transducer
to
operate
the
filters,
we
are
using
the
sensors
for
getting
soil
moisture
data.
So,
those
sensors
and
controllers,
so,
those
parts
controllers,
actuators
as
I
told
you
we
will be going in detail about this part.When
we
talk
about
sensor ,
sensor
is
a
device
which
is
used
to
convert
physical
process,
physical
phenomena
in
measurable
form.
So,
this
data
which
is
being
collected
in
analog
voltage,
sometime
we
express
in
terms
of
voltage
or
we
can
say
current
or
the
ohm
with
resistance
form
it
is
brought
but
it
is
converted
to
the
digital
signal.
And
this
conversion
is
made in the form of human readable display for further reading and processing this data.
So,
sensors
output
can
be
continuous
or
discrete
in
nature.
Continuous
here
suppose
we
are
collecting
temperature
data
for
whole
day
24
hours
and
then
every
minute
or
every
second
you
are
getting
data.
So,
there
are
some
certain
processes
where
every
minute
or
every
second
is
required
but
sometime
we
need
maximum
temperature
when
it
had
occurred,
sometime
we
need
only
minimum
temperature
data.
So,
those
data
is
not
in
the
continuous
form, but it may be in the discrete form.
They
produce
signal
of
the
data
which
has
been
collected
by
the
sensor ,
they
produce
signal
maybe
that
I
told
you
that
it
could
be
in
the
voltage
form
it
could
be
in
the
current
form
means
voltage,
current
means
in
the
ampere
we
say,
conductivity
millimhos/decisiemons,
capacitance.
So,
that
means,
there
could
be
any
other
measurable
electrical
property .
So
a
sensor
should
have
these
qualities
one
is
that
it
should
be
sensitive
to
measure
property ,
it
should
be
insensitive
to
other
property
like
encountered
in
the
application
and
it
should
not
get
influence
by
other
property
when
we
are
measuring.
So,
these
are
some
of
the
important
points when we are considering the data collected by any sensor .
Now ,
these
sensors
could
be
of
different
categories,
it
can
be
electromagnetic
sensor
and
it
has
got
its
own
application
in
different
areas.
So,
electromagnetic,
optical,
mechanical,
electro-chemical,
air
flow,
infrared.
So,
these
are
the
different
categories
of
the
sensors
which
are used.
Let
us
try
to
learn
more
detail
about
each
of
these
sensors.
As
the
name
says
electromagnetic
sensor ,
so,
it
is
an
electronic
device
to
measure
physical
quantity
such
as
pressure,
sound,
value
which
will
convert
to
electronic
signal.
Maybe
as
I
told
you
that
it
could
be
a
voltage
form.
So,
example
can
be
a
metal
detector
or
electric
voltage
sensor .
Optical
sensor ,
as
thename
say
it
is
the
optical,
so
it
is
related
with
the
light.
So,
optical
sensor
converts
light
rays
into electronic signals and this could be ambient light sensors or image sensors.
So,
we
used
optical
sensor
for
automating
the
irrigation
system.
So,
there
where
we
kept
in
a
tensiometer
and
when
the
water
was
being
the
soil
moisture
deficiency
was
taking
place.
So,
mercury
in
the
manometer
it
was
going
up
when
there
is
suction
is
created
in
the
tensiometer
and
the
diode
which
is
used
it
was
detecting
the
signal
when
the
light
was
being
obstructed
because
of
the
raise
of
the
mercury
in
the
glass
limb
of
the
mercury
manometer
tube
so,
it
was
giving
so
that
is
some
kind
of
a
sensor
which
was
being
obstructed,
so
light
was
not
able
to pass. So, this kind of a sensor these are optical sensor .
Mechanical
sensor
is
the
sensor
that
is
some
form
of
the
mechanical
deformation
that
translate
and
deforms
into
the
electrical
signal.
So,
potentiometric
displacement
sensor
is
one
of
the
example
or
metal
strain
gauges,
strain
gauges
for
finding
out
any
deflection
when
we
are
taking
some
of
the
tire
pressure
or
some
study
which
is
taken
when
we
are
finding
out
the
certain studies in the soil dynamics, so, such type of strain gauges are used for that studies.
Electrochemical
sensor ,
as
the
name
is
given
electrochemical
means
it
is
related
to
the
chemical.
So,
concentrates
of
a
specific
chemical
within
an
electrical
circuit
that
it
used.
So,
blood
glucose
sensor
is
one
of
the
electrochemical
sensor ,
Co2
that
is
a
carbon
dioxide
sensor
this
is
used
for
finding
out
the
environmental
sensor ,
finding
out
the
Co2
level
in
the
environment,
particularly
in
greenhouse
studies,
electrochemical
sensors
their
Co2
sensor
is
used.
Air
flow
sensor
is
a
sensor
that
is
used
to
determine
the
flow
rate
of
air
through
a
cross
section,
so
volume
air
flow
sensor ,
coldwire
sensors
are
the
examples
of
airflow
sensor .
An
infrared
sensor
is
an
electronic
device
that
measures,
detects
infrared
radiation
in
surrounding
environment.
So,
infrared
heat
gun,
infrared
image
sensor
are
used.
This
is
the
one
device,
now,
this
device
we
are
seeing
here,
image
picture
it
is
when
we
used
in
the
experimental
farm
where
the
wheat
crop
was
being
grown
and
we
were
irrigating
by
using
the
micro
sprinkler
system.
So,
we
found
out
the
air
temperature
and
then
also
the
leaf
temperature.
Thedifference
in
the
leaf
temperature
and
air
temperature
and
then
corresponding
vapour
pressure
of the air and vapour pressure of the leaf, we found out the dif ference.
So,
difference
was
correlated
to
find
out
the
crop
water
stress
index.
So,
for
such
studies
infrared
sensor
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
object
from
the
distance
the
temperature
is
used.
Sometimes
temperature
of
the
object
is
very
high
particularly
say
we
want
to
find
out
the
temperature
of
a
furnace.
So,
one
has
to
take
observation
from
the
long
distance
by
using
the remote data from the distance. So, there such types of sensors are useful for those studies.
Weather
sensor
which
are
commonly
used
for
the
MIS
automation.
So,
this
weather
sensor
say
environmental
temperature,
humidity ,
solar
radiation,
rain,
wind,
atmospheric
pressure
these
data
are
used
to
find
out
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
Air
pollution,
the
pollution
in
the
air
that
affect
the
ET
value,
affect
the
temperature,
affect
the
solar
radiation part. So, that data are also used in the sensor to find out the ET  value.
Then
there
are
sensors
which
are
used
to
find
out
the
soil
temperature,
to
find
out
the
soil
moisture
content,
these
data
are
important.
From
the
soil
quality
point
of
view
that
what
is
the
soil
pH
value,
what
is
the
soil
nutrition
value,
NPK
value
sensors
also
used
or
even
water
quality data are also used for the automation of micro irrigation system.
These
are
the
some
of
the
sensors
which
are
very
commonly
used
mainly
for
finding
out
the
temperature.
So,
you
can
see
DHT1 1,
DHT22,
AM,
LM
all
these
numbers
which
are
given
these
sensors
which
are
listed
here
these
are
used
to
determine
the
air
temperature
as
well
as
the
air
humidity .
These
sensors
which
are
listed
here
this
is
for
solar
radiation,
for
rain
for
monitoring
the
rainfall.
So,
the
sensors
are
used
which
are
giving
the
data
in
the
digital
form.
And that those data are used to find out the rainfall, wind, atmospheric pressure.
So,
these
data
are
used
for
finding
all
the
environmental
air
pollution.
So,
this
MQ
135,
such
sensors
are
use
for
weather
monitoring.
For
finding
out
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop
accordingly
the
irrigation
estimation
is
done.
Then
for
the
soil
temperature
and
soil
moisture
content
these
are
the
some
of
the
sensors
name
which
are
commercially
available
and they are being used for soil nutrition, soil pH level sensors are being used for monitoring.So,
DHT
22
which
you
see
here
these
are
the
photographs
which
we
have
taken
for
this
use.
So,
DHT
22
it
is
a
capacitive
temperature-humidity
sensor
sensing
module,
it
produced
the
digital
output
and
operating
voltage
ranges
of
5
volts
and
then
the
range
is
from
minus
40
degrees
Celsius
to
80
degrees
Celsius,
with
the
resolution
of
0.1
degrees
Celsius
and
plus
minus
0.5
degree
Celsius
is
the
range
of
the
data.
And
then
the
humidity
range
0
to
100%
with
the
error
plus
minus
2%
RH
and
then
the
resolution
is
of
a
0.1%.
These
are
the
features
of the DHT22.
The
soil
moisture
sensor
means
I
am
not
reading
but
more
or
less
you
may
find
out
this
is
the
range
which
are
used
for
power
capacity
temperature
and
humidity
sensing
more
or
less
same
then
capacity
soil
moisture
sensor
this
is
the
sensor
which
you
can
see
this
is
available
commercially .
And
then
the
range
measures
the
soil
moisture
levels
by
capacitive
sensing.
So,
the
advantage
here
because
it
is
measured
by
the
capacitive
sensing.
It
is
not
affected
by
the
value
of
the
soil
salinity .
So,
this
is
the
one
advantage
and
then
the
ranges
of
data
which
we are getting that is 3.3 to 5.5 volt it operates.
This
is
the
sensor
which
was
developed
at
IIT
Kharagpur
by
one
of
my
PhD
student
he
worked
with
me
where
we
developed
the
sensor
and
then
the
sensor
was
working
inductance
point
of
view
means
capacity
as
well
as
the
resistant
property
of
the
soil
moisture
content
it
was
measured.
So,
we
use
the
media
that
is
a
granular
media
which
used
an
in
order
to
neglect
the
effect
of
soil
salinity .
So,
the
gypsum
wafer
was
used
and
there
is
a
nylon
cloth
and then the steel electrodes.
So,
we
optimize
the
spacing
between
the
these
electrodes
and
then
the
thickness
of
the
material
we
did
and
then
the
soil
which
we
use
this
medium
was
the
sand
which
was
wash
properly
and
then
size
was
calibrated
by
conducting
the
large
time
experiment.
And
then
we
standardise
the
size
which
should
be
used
in
the
sensor
and
then
the
sensor
was
used
to
automate first we calibrated sensor and then we used in the automated irrigation system.
Controller
is
another
device
after
the
sensor .
Controller
is
another
device
which
is
used
in
the
automation
system.
So,
a
controller
is
a
device
that
converts
the
physical
amounts
such
as
soilmoisture
content,
soil
temperature,
soil
humidity
into
some
kind
of
electrical
signal
and
this
signal
could
be
in
the
form
of
a
voltage.
Controller
performs
a
simple
accumulating
function
and send the raw data, raw data back to the control center .
So,
data
from
a
single
sensor
or
set
of
the
sensors
it
is
combined
by
the
sensor
then
it
performs
the
local
data
analysis
and
that
is
before
taking
any
action.
So,
this
controller
could
be
Arduino
mega
Uno
Nano
and
then
Raspberry
Pi
etcetera
that
these
are
the
controllers
which
are
used.
A
controller
which
you
see
here,
this
is
one
controller
it
has
a
microprocessor
and
it
has
got
the
memory
card
it
has
got
the
input
output
port
and
then
there
is
interfacing
control unit.
So,
let
us
know
about
the
components
of
a
controller .
A
microprocessor ,
it
is
a
device
that
is
used
for
computational
work.
So,
it
is
a
central
processing
unit
CPU
on
a
single
IC
chip
which
is
containing
millions
of
very
small
components
including
transistors,
resistors,
diodes
that
work
together .
So,
microprocessor
use
3
step
that
is
called
fetch,
decode
and
execute.
These are the steps which are involved in microprocessor .
So,
what
is
the
fetching
of
the
information
that
is
the
instruction
set
is
copied
from
the
memory
into
the
microprocessor
register .
Decoding
is
one
of
the
operations
which
is
done.
So,
this
means,
this
is
basically
it
converts
instruction
to
set
into
the
machine
language
that
determine
what
to
do
with
the
data.
Then
the
next
operation
it
involves
that
is
an
executing
the
instruction
that
is
set
and
the
instruction
set
and
output
the
desired
result
that
is
the
3
steps
which are used.
Memory
is
another
components
of
the
controller .
So,
this
memory
is
a
device
or
system
that
is
used
to
store
the
information
for
immediate
or
delayed
use
in
the
computing
device.
So,
it
will
depend
upon
how
much
storage
of
the
data
and
how
long
we
want
to
store
the
data
depending
on
the
amount
of
data
it
is
being
collected,
which
require.
So,
this
is
the
part
of
the
digital memory which we will be doing which is done.
So,
it
is
the
digital
memory
manufactured
from
the
metal
oxide
silicon
transistor
on
an
IC.
There
are
2
main
kinds
of
semiconductor
memory
one
is
the
volatile
or
non-volatile
memory .Volatile
means
it
loses
data
if
it
is
without
power .
So,
it
needs
the
power .
So,
volatile
means,
if
the
data
it
is
immediately
it
is
transferred,
then
we
go
for
the
volatile.
So,
it
is
an
example
a
dynamic
random
access
memory
that
we
call
a
DRAM
or
a
static
random
access
memory
that
is SRAM.
Non-volatile
the
data
remains,
is
stored
with
or
without
power .
So,
example
read
only
memory
that
is
a
ROM,
Programmable
Read
Only
Memory
that
is
a
PROM,
Erasable
Programmable
Read
Only
Memory
that
is
an
EPROM
or
flash
memory .
So,
this
is
the
one
and
the
ROM
that
is
your
read
only
memory
is
stores
controller
program
in
the
microcontroller .
So,
RAM
holds
the
data
waiting
for
processing
by
the
microprocessor
this
is
the data which hold and then this is used for the further processing of the data.
Input
output
ports,
this
particular
port
you
know
these
ports
are
the
connections
to
your
device
sensor
or
actuators.
So,
ports
act
as
input
from
the
sensor
to
the
device.
The
I/O
ports
maybe
it
could
be
a
digital
or
it
can
be
in
the
analog
form.
So,
digital
ports
are
simple
logic
which
we
use
yes
or
no
type
of
input
or
output.
Analog
ports
could
be
of
continuous
input
output
like
temperature
we
are
collecting
data
of
the
temperature
relative
humidity
or
it
can
be in speed form.
So,
micro
controllers
are
the
digital
devices,
so
that
signals
moving
in
or
out
must
also
be
in
the
digital
format.
So,
input
from
the
analog
sensors
used
an
analog
to
digital
converter
that
is
what we call as that A to D converter .
Then
the
fourth
component
in
the
controller
is
a
control
interface,
control
interface
is
a
protocol
allowing
peripheral
devices
and
then
the
microcontroller
to
communicate
with
one
another .
So,
there
are
different
peripheral
devices
that
use
different
protocol.
So,
example,
here
it
is
a
given
as
12C
that
the
inter
integrated
circuit
that
is
the
IC
which
is
used
for
organic
light
diodes
that
OLED
display
our
Serial
Peripheral
Interface
that
is
SPI
Controller
Area Network that is a CAN communications protocol etcetera.
So,
the
functions
of
these
controllers
are
on
a
particular
controller ,
it
has
the
sensor
data
accumulation
and
the
sanitization
of
the
data
then
synchronization
with
the
timesynchronization
means
the
data
which
it
is
receiving
from
the
sensor
and
then
when
it
is
transforming,
so,
this
would
synchronize
with
the
both
the
systems,
then
the
data
are
sent
to
the processing unit or server .
Receiving
the
command
from
user
or
autonomous
server ,
monitoring
and
operating
the
actuator
based
on
the
received
commands,
notifying
any
kind
of
anomaly
in
the
system
and
protect
the
system
from
erratic
behaviour .
A
controller
consists
of
these
functions
means
these
are
the
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
controller
and
these
characteristics
it
should
have.
Now ,
actuator
is
another
component,
it
is
a
component
of
a
system
or
machine
that
converts
energy.
This
energy
could
be
in
the
form
of
electrical,
it
can
be
the
air
it
can
be
hydraulic,
it
received
command
from
the
controller .
So,
it
received
command
from
the
controller .
So,
an
actuator
can
have
the
functions
of
the
different
components
and
so,
it
is
the
one
is
the
power
source
it
provides
the
energy
input
which
is
necessary
to
drive
the
actuator .
These
are
often
electric or fluid in nature.
So,
power
converter ,
the
role
of
the
power
converter
is
to
supply
power
from
the
source
to
the
actuator ,
there
is
a
hydraulic
proportional
valves
or
electrical
inverters
are
the
examples
of
the
power
converter
which
is
used
in
the
industrial
purpose
and
then
mechanical
load
the
energy
converted
by
the
actuator
usually
it
uses
the
mechanical
device
and
mechanical
load
this
to
the mechanical system that is being driven by the actuator .
Actuators
could
be
of
hydraulic,
pneumatic
or
mechanical
type,
so,
hydraulic,
pneumatic,
electrical
or
mechanical.
So,
electrical
type
could
be
of
these
5
types
which
are
explained
in
the
further
in
those
slides.
So,
you
can
see
here
the
hydraulic
actuator
it
is
one
of
the
example
is
given
here
is
the
hydraulic
brake
system.
So,
hydraulic
actuator
consists
of
a
cylinder
or
fluid
meter
that
uses
the
hydraulic
power
to
facilitate
mechanical
operation.
So,
hydraulic
brake
or
hydraulic
lifter
they
use
hydraulic
type
of
actuator
and
where
there
is
a
brake
pedal
when
it
operates.
So,
there
is
a
disc
and
then
disk
it
is
causing,
stopping
the
wheel
when
it
is
in operation.Pneumatic
actuator ,
it
uses
the
air
power
or
force
to
produce
the
rotary
or
linear
motion.
So,
it
uses
the
piston
and
diaphragm
which
develop
the
motor
power
and
then
the
air
pressure
or
force,
forces
the
diaphragm
to
move
the
valve
or
rotate
the
valve
to
control
the
system.
So,
this is one kind of device which is shown here for the pneumatic type of controller .
Electrical
actuator ,
so,
there
could
be
electromechanical
actuator ,
this
is
which
uses
the
mechanical
actuator
where
the
control
knob
or
handle
is
replaced
by
the
electric
motor
and
then
the
rotary
motion
of
the
motor
is
converted
to
the
linear
displacement.
So,
the
electro
hydraulic
actuator
EHAs
replaces
the
hydraulic
system
with
self-contained
actuator
solely
by
the electrical power . So, linear actuator is an actuator that creates motion in a straight line.
The
types
of
actuator
this
is
the
another
electrical
type
of
actuator
it
could
be
a
thermal
device,
a
thermal
actuator ,
where
it
is
actuated
by
the
thermal
energy
to
a
solid
state
material
and
thermal
actuators
can
be
triggered
by
using
the
temperature
as
the
sensors
which
will
be
giving the information in terms of the heat that the Joule ef fect is being used.
Magnetic
type
actuator ,
it
is
an
actuator
which
works
on
the
basis
of
the
electromagnetic
principle
for
energy
conversion
is
called
electromagnetic
actuator .
Electromagnetic
actuator
convert
the
electronic
magnetic
energy
into
the
mechanical
energy.
Solenoid
valves
are
the
examples
which
are
now
used
in
micro
irrigation
system
to
actuate
the
pump
or
actuate
your
particular
line
maybe
it
is
a
mainline
it
can
be
sub-mainline
or
it
can
actuate
the
each
individual lateral pipeline. So, that will be that is used.
Then
mechanical
actuator ,
a
mechanical
actuator
converts
one
form
of
the
motion
to
another
form
such
as
rotary
motion
to
another
such
as
a
linear
motion
to
carry
out
the
movement.
So,
an
example
is
a
rack
or
pinion.
So,
the
operation
of
the
mechanical
actuator
is
based
on
the
combination
of
the
structural
components
such
as
the
gear,
rail
or
pulley
or
chains,
so
these
are
the
different
types
of
actuator
mainly
you
will
find
in
our
case,
in
case
of
micro
irrigation
system, we use the solenoid valve or electromagnetic.
And
these
are
the
references
which
you
can
refer
in
this
particularly
to
go
deeper
about
this
topic.So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
discussed
about
the
components
that
is
a
sensor
we
discussed
about
the
sensors,
a
commonly
used
sensors
for
micro
irrigation
system,
controllers,
we
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
actuators.
Now ,
in
the
coming
lecture,
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system
part
3
where
we
will
discuss
about
the
different
types
of
network,
different
types
of
software
which
are
used
in
the
forthcoming
lecture. So, thank you very much.
