Numerical Examples on Fluid Mechanics and Soil Water
Hello
everybody ,
welcome
to
lecture
5.
In
previous
4
lectures,
we
discussed
about
introduction
of
micro
irrigation
system.
We
discussed
about
basic
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
and
soil
properties.
Now ,
in
this
lecture
we
will
deal
with
various
examples
related
to
numerical
problems,
an
application
of
fluid
mechanic
principles,
numerical
problem
dealing
with
soil
properties, and infiltration.
So,
let
us
start
doing
exercise.
These
are
simple
exercises,
this
will
make
you
to
more
understand
more about these lectures which I have covered on theory part.
So,
question
1,
we
are
given
1
liter
of
liquid
which
weighs
2
Newton
and
we
are
required
to
determine
a
specific
weight,
density
of
this
liquid,
and
a
specific
gravity
of
this
liquid.
So,
basically ,
in
this
question
we
are
given
1
liter
of
liquid
and
its
weight
and
we
will
find
out
these
3
properties of this liquid and this is basically unit conversion.
So,
if
we
see
that
1
liter
of
a
liquid,
it
has
a
weight
of
2
Newton
and
1
liter
is
1
into
10
is
to
power
minus
3
cubic
meter
volume.
Now ,
if
you
want
to
find
out
the
unit
a
specific
weight
of
this liquid, so basically we will work out by
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡(γ)= 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑
So,
once
we
are
writing
this
particular
ratio,
we
are
given
2
Newton
is
the
weight
and
the
volume
is 1 into 10 is to power minus 3 cubic meter .
=γ2
(11000)
= 2000γ 𝑁
𝑚3So,
a
specific
weight
it
becomes
2000
Newton
per
cubic
meter .
Now ,
when
this
same
liquid
we
are
finding
out
what
will
be
the
density
of
this
liquid.
So,
we
have
been
given
from
the
previous
example,
we
got
the
specific
weight
as
2000
Newton
per
cubic
meter .
And
we
want
to
get
density ,
so
density
unit
is
mass
per
cubic
meter .
So,
already
we
have
got
200
Newton
per
cubic
meter and we can express same thing in terms of kilogram per cubic meter .
𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦(ρ)= 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑(𝑤)𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑔)
=                                ρ20009.8066
= 203.94                                ρ 𝑘𝑔
𝑚3
So,
the
density
of
this
liquid
can
be
worked
out
as
203.94
kilogram
per
cubic
meter .
Now
a
specific
gravity ,
when
we
want
to
find
out,
so
a
specific
gravity
is
given
by
a
weight
density
of
a
liquid
divided
by
weight
density
of
standard
liquid,
standard
liquid
is
nothing
but
a
water .
And
this
water
has
got
a
density
of
1000
kilogram
per
cubic
meter
and
weight
density
of
this
liquid
which we worked out as 203.94.
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝐺)= 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑙𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑
G =203.94(1000)
G= 0.2039
So,
when
we
are
working
out
we
get
a
specific
gravity
of
this
liquid
as
g
is
equal
to
0.2039,
this
is
the
value.
So,
in
this
particular
example,
what
we
have
found
that
there
is
a
simple
unit
conversion,
we
are
getting
a
specific
weight
and
we
are
using
the
specific
weight
values
to
find
out
the
density .
And
then
having
got
the
value
of
density
we
are
getting
a
specific
gravity
of
the
same liquid. So, this is a simple unit conversion way how we are working out these values.
Now
in
question
2,
we
are
given
a
main
pipeline
and
this
pipeline
carries
water
and
which
has
the
velocity
of
flow
as
2.4
meter
per
second.
Now
the
diameter
of
main
pipeline
is
75
millimeter
after
a
few
meter
of
its
length,
this
diameter
is
reduced
to
50
millimeter .
Now ,
we
want
todetermine
in
the
question,
what
is
the
velocity
head
at
the
inlet
end
of
these
2
pipes,
means
75
millimeter as well as 50 millimeter diameter pipeline.
And
also
we
want
to
find
out
the
dischar ge
from
this
pipeline.
Now
in
the
tapered
pipe
that
is
50
millimeter
pipeline,
1
piezometer
has
been
attached
and
the
water
level
in
the
piezometer
is
7
meter .
So,
it
is
asked
in
the
question
that
what
will
be
the
water
pressure,
so
7
meter
of
water
column
is
to
be
converted
in
equivalent
unit.
So,
if
you
see
here
we
are
given
2
pipes
one
pipeline is 75 millimeter another pipeline is 50 millimeter .
And
velocity
through
the
main
pipeline
that
is
75
millimeter
pipeline
is
2.4
meter
per
second.
So,
we
are
required
to
determine
velocity
head,
we
are
required
to
determine
rate
of
flow,
and
we
are
required to find out what will the pressure in the 50 millimeter diameter pipeline.
So,
we
are
given
these
2
diameters,
from
these
diameter
of
the
pipeline,
main
pipeline
is
75
millimeter
which
is
nothing
but
0.075
meter .
And
for
this
diameter
area
of
cross
section
is
pi
by
4
D
1
square.
So,
substituting
the
value
of
D
1,
we
get
the
area
of
cross
section
of
the
pipeline
of
75
millimeter .
Similarly ,
for
second
pipeline
which
is
of
50
millimeter
diameter
A
2
is
1.96
into
10 is to power minus 3 meter square.
Now ,
we
are
given
the
velocity
to
the
pipeline
is
2.4
meter
per
second.
So,
one
can
work
out
what
will
be
the
velocity
head.
So,
velocity
head
is
given
by
V
1
square
by
2g,
so
simply
substituting the value of velocity and then g is 9.81.
Velocity head in 75 mm main pipe =(𝑉1)2
2𝑔=(2.4)2
2×9.81=0.2935 𝑚
So,
once
we
are
substituting
we
get
velocity
head
as
0.2935
in
the
pipe
of
75
millimeter
diameter .
Now , here we are using the concept of continuity equation which states that
A
1
V
1
= A
2
V
2
.
Means
flow
from
the
pipeline
in
the
75
millimeter
pipeline
is
equal
to
the
flow
in
the
50
millimeter
pipeline.
So,
from
this
we
will
be
getting
what
will
be
the
velocity .
So,
velocity
in
thesecond
pipeline
that
is
50
millimeter
pipeline
can
be
obtained
by
putting
A
1
V
1
by
A
2
V
2
which
when we are substituting area of cross section of the pipeline 1 and velocity and divided by A
2
.
m/s𝑉2=𝐴1𝑉1𝐴2=4.4178×10−3×2.4
1.9635×10−3=5.4
So,
we
get
the
velocity
in
second
pipeline
is
5.4
meter
per
second.
Now
velocity
head,
once
we
have got the velocity . So, one can work out what is the velocity head and this velocity head.
Velocity head in 50 mm tapered pipe =(𝑉2)2
2𝑔=(5.4)2
2×9.81=1.4862 𝑚
So
equivalent
velocity
head
after
calculation,
we
get
1.4862
meter .
Now ,
we
have
got
velocity
head
that
this
was
asked
in
the
question
that
what
is
the
velocity
head.
So,
velocity
head
in
75
millimeter pipeline is 8.2935, velocity in 50 millimeter pipeline is 1.4862 meter .
Now ,
since
using
the
continuity
equation
concept,
one
can
find
out
what
will
be
the
dischar ge?
So, dischar ge will be nothing but area of cross section multiplied by the velocity .
=𝑄𝐴1𝑉1=𝐴2𝑉2
So,
this
will
be
velocity
in
pipe
1
or
area
of
cross
section
of
pipe
2
that
is
50
millimeter
diameter
and velocity we have got 5.4 meter per second, so accordingly we can find out.
𝑄=4.4178×10−3×2.4=0.00106=10.6 𝐿/𝑠
So,
we
got
rate
of
flow
as
10.6
liter
per
second.
So,
this
is
the
3rd
part
of
the
question
which
was
asked.
Now
4th
part
of
the
question
it
was
asked,
what
is
the
pressure
in
the
tapered
pipe?
That
is
a 50 millimeter pipeline. Now the water level in the piezometer is 7 meter .
𝑝=ρ𝑔𝑍
So,
we
can
write
7
meter
and
the
pressure
equal
to
rho
is
the
density
of
liquid
or
water
which
is
1000
kilogram
per
cubic
meter ,
g
is
the
acceleration
due
to
gravity
that
is
9.81
meter
per
second
square which when we are multiplying
𝑝=1000×9.81×7=68670𝑁
𝑚2=0. 7𝑘𝑔
𝑐𝑚2We
get
this
68670
Newton
per
meter
square
or
which
is
equivalent
to
0.7
kg
per
square
centimeter .
So,
this
is
the
4th
part
of
the
equation
which
was
asked
in
the
question
that
what
the
pressure
is.
So,
this
is
also
simply
unit
conversion.
Already
we
were
given
7
meter
of
water
column
which
is
0.7
kg
per
square
centimeter
but
how
to
get
0.7
kg
per
square
centimeter?
Here,
we
are
using
appropriate
unit
and
that
is
in
Newton
per
square
meter
when
we
are
then
it
can
be
obtained in 0.7 kg per square centimeter .
Now
in
third
question,
we
will
be
again
using
the
concept
of
fluid
mechanics,
how
to
obtain
the
component
of
total
head?
So,
let
us
try
to
from
this
we
have
been
given
here
in
a
sprinkler
system
water
is
flowing
in
a
pipeline
of
80
millimeter
diameter
and
the
pressure
when
it
is
at
tapped
in
this
pipeline
it
is
having
30
Newton
per
square
centimeter .
And
the
velocity
of
flow
in
this pipeline is 2.4 meter per second.
We
are
given
again
this
pipeline
is
laid
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
4
meter
above
the
reference
plane
or
above
the
datum.
So,
means
we
are
given
diameter
of
the
pipeline,
we
have
got
the
pressure
and then we have got the velocity of flow . So, here simply we will be using ener gy equation.
So,
total
head
in
the
pipeline
is
given
by
pressure
head,
velocity
head
plus
elevation
head.
Head
due
to
elevation.
Already
I
have
told
you
that
D
is
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline
which
is
0.08
meter .
P
is
30
Newton
per
centimeter
square
or
I
can
say
30
into
10
is
to
power
4
Newton
per
square
meter
and
elevation
head
is
4
meter .
So,
when
we
are
writing,
let
us
write
total
head,
so
total ener gy or total head it is given by
z𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐻𝑇
(
)=𝑝ρ𝑔+𝑉2
2𝑔+
So,
all
these
components
are
available
to
us
only
simply
we
have
to
substitute
the
values.
So,
P
is
already given,
4𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐻𝑇
(
)=(30×104)(1000×9.81)+(2.4)2
(2×9.81)+
34.87 m𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐻𝑇
(
)=So
total
head
it
becomes
34.87
meter .
So,
this
was
the
question
which
was
asked?
So,
total
head
in the pipeline is 34.87 meter .
So,
there
we
have
use
energy
equation.
Now
let
us
come
to
the
4th
question,
in
this
4th
question
we
are
given
the
water
is
flowing
through
a
pipeline
having
diameter
63
millimeter
at
section
1.
So,
there
are
2
section
one
section
which
has
a
diameter
of
the
pipeline
at
63
millimeter .
In
the
section
2,
another
pipeline
which
is
of
50
millimeter
diameter
and
the
flow
which
is
taking
place
in this pipeline is 5.5 liter per second.
Then
elevation
head
at
section
1
is
given
4.5
meter
above
the
datum
and
elevation
head
3.5
meter
above
that
deepened
section
2
and
pressure
at
section
1
is
20
Newton
per
centimeter
square
and
we
are
required
to
determine
the
pressure
at
section
2.
So,
once
again
I
am
reading
water
is
flowing
through
a
pipeline
having
diameter
63
millimeter
at
section
1
and
50
millimeter
diameter
pipeline at section 2, rate of flow through pipe is 5.5 liter per second.
Section
1
is
4.5
meter
above
datum
means
it
is
at
the
inclined
plane,
means
the
pipeline
is
not
in
the
same
elevation.
So,
there
is
inclination
that
is
4.5
meter ,
the
elevation
head
and
then
the
pipeline
at
section
2;
this
is
at
3.5
meters,
so
pipe
is
not
in
the
same
level.
And
then
pressure
head
at
section
1
is
20
Newton
per
centimeter
square.
So,
we
need
to
determine
pressure
head
at
section 2.
So,
the
values
are
given,
so
63
millimeter
is
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline
1,
then
50
millimeter
at
pipe
2.
So,
we
are
finding
out
area
of
cross
Section
A
1,
that
is
pi
by
4
D
1
square
and
this
is
the
value
when
we
are
substituting
63
millimeter
square,
so
that
63
is
converted
in
meter .
Similarly
for
the
area
of
cross
section
of
floor
in
pipe
2,
we
worked
out
that
is
1.9635
into
10
is
to
power
minus 3 meter square.
This
value
is
given
to
us,
we
are
given
elevation
head
which
we
at
section
1
is
given
by
z
1
is
equal
to
4.5
meter ,
z
2
equal
to
3.5
meter ,
flow
is
given
we
have
converted
this
in
liter
per
secondto
meter
cube
per
second.
So,
here
we
will
be
using
continuity
equation,
that
already
we
know
that
=𝑄𝐴1𝑉1=𝐴2𝑉2
Means,
dischar ge
at
section
1
equal
to
dischar ge
at
section
2.
And
then
from
this
particular
equation we are getting what is the velocity of flow .
m/s𝑉1=𝑄𝐴1=5.5×10−3
3.117×10−3=1.76
We
have
got
as
1.76
meter
per
second.
Similarly
we
are
substituting
V
2
,
velocity
at
section
2
can
be obtained by using the continuity equation.
m/s𝑉2=𝑄𝐴2=5.5×10−3
1.9635×10−3=2.80
So, we get velocity in section 2 is 2.8 meter per second.
Now
we
are
using
here
Bernoulli’ s
equation.
Bernoulli
equation
that
pressure
head
plus
velocity
head plus elevation head equal to constant.
=𝑝1ρ𝑔+(𝑉1)2
2𝑔+𝑍1𝑝2ρ𝑔+(𝑉2)2
2𝑔+𝑍2
Now
when
we
are
taking
two
section
means
velocity
at
section
1
velocity
head,
pressure
head,
and
elevation
head
equal
to
pressure
head
plus
velocity
head
plus
elevation
at
section
2,
these
2
at
the
2
sections
these
are
equal.
So,
having
substituted
the
values
of
pressure
head
that
is
already
given.
And
then
we
have
got
the
velocity
we
have
calculated,
so
velocity
head
we
are
substituting
elevation
head
we
are
substituting
except
p
2
.
All
the
parameters
in
the
right
hand
side of the equation is known to us.
=20×1041000×9.81+(1.76)2
2×9.81+4.5𝑝21000×9.81+(2.80)2
2×9.81+3.5
So, we have worked out pressure head or intensity of pressure at section 2 is
= 20.736 × 10
4
N/m
2𝑝2Which
can
be
written
as
20.736
Newton
per
centimeter
square
or
this
can
be
further
converted
by
dividing
20.736
Newton
per
centimeter
square
dividing
with
9.81
then
we
get
2.1137
kg
per
square centimeter .
So,
this
is
the
value
pressure
at
section
2
is
this
value.
So,
this
is
the
answer ,
desired
answer
which was asked in the question.
Now ,
when
we
come
to
the
5th
question.
Now ,
5th
question
deals
with
movement
of
water
through
soil
by
infiltration
process.
Now ,
in
infiltration
process
we
are
given
that
relationship
between
accumulated
depths
of
infiltration
which
is
y,
it
is
expressed
in
centimeter
and
this
particular relationship was obtained when the infiltration test was conducted.
So, y = 0.57t
0.70
+ 0.05
And
we
are
asked
to
determine
the
infiltration
rate
at
5
minute
and
at
30
minute
elapsed
time.
So,
the
equation
which
was
established
it
is
the
modified
form
of
Kostiakov’ s
equation.
And
the
modified form of the Kostiakov’ s equation is given by y = at
α
+ b
Now ,
in
this
equation
which
we
have
a
is
equal
to
0.57,
alpha
equal
to
0.7
and
b
equal
to
0.05.
Now
this
is
a
cumulative
depth
equation
of
infiltration
or
accumulated
depth
of
infiltration
equation.
So,
we
are
asked
to
determine
infiltration
rate
at
5
minute
elapsed
time
as
well
as
for
30 minutes elapsed time.
So,
if
we
are
taking
rate
of
infiltration,
we
have
to
obtain
the
first
derivative
of
this
equation.
So,
first derivative of this equation dy by dt which we can write as
𝑑𝑦𝑑𝑡=𝑎α𝑡α−1
a
infiltration
rate
equal
to
a
into
alpha
t
alpha
minus
1.
So,
a
is
0.57
and
alpha
is
0.7,
t
is
5
minute
and alpha minus 0.7 minus 0.1.
𝐼=0.57×0.70(5)0.70−1
𝐼=0.246 𝑐𝑚/𝑚𝑖𝑛So,
when
we
solve
this
equation
rate
of
infiltration
at
5
minute
interval,
it
comes
as
0.246
centimeter per minute, this can be converted in centimeter per hour .
𝐼=14.76 𝑐𝑚/ℎ
So,
this
can
be
written
as
I
is
equal
to
14.76
centimeter
per
hour,
so
this
is
for
5
minute
elapsed
time.
Now ,
when
we
are
interested
to
obtain
a
30
minute,
it
is
a
very
simple
in
the
same
way
we
did
for
5
minute
interval,
we
can
do
for
30
minute
interval.
Already
we
have
the
value
of
A
that
is
0.57,
we
have
a
value
of
alpha
that
is
0.7
and
t
is
30
minute,
so
we
are
substituting
t
30
and
alpha
0.7 minus 1.
𝐼=0.57×0.70(30)0.70−1
𝐼=0.1438 𝑐𝑚/𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝐼=8.63 𝑐𝑚/ℎ
So,
this
can
be
converted
in
centimeter
per
hour.
So,
I
for
30
minutes
elapsed
time
is
8.63
centimeter
per
hour.
So,
here
we
can
see
that
at
initial
time
the
rate
of
infiltration
is
high
and
as
we
go
for
the
longer
time
interval
or
longer
elapsed
time
the
rate
of
infiltration
is
decreasing
with
the
time.
And
after
some
time
you
will
obtain
this
rate
of
infiltration
it
becomes
constant,
and
this rate of infiltration is known as basic rate of infiltration when it becomes constant.
Sometime
when
we
do
not
have
the
value
of
hydraulic
conductivity ,
so
basic
infiltration
rate
is
used as the value of hydraulic conductivity of the soil.
Sixth
question
basically
it
deals
with
obtaining
the
physical
properties
of
soil.
These
are
all
basic
parameter
which
I
explained
in
soil
property
class,
those
parameters
are
here.
We
are
determining
mathematically ,
numerically ,
you
will
find
the
value
so
that
you
get
practice
and
you
can
have
more
experience
and
confidence
in
dealing
with
such
problems.
So,
here
a
question
is
given an undisturbed soil sample of 500 gram was collected by using core sampler .
Core
sampler ,
it
is
a
device
where
the
soil
sample
is
collected
at
desired
depth.
So,
this
core
sampler
having
a
volume
of
3
into
10
is
to
power
minus
4
cubic
meter
and
after
oven
drying
at105
degrees
Celsius
for
24
hours.
The
weight
of
soil
sample
was
reduced
to
400
gram,
a
specific
gravity
of
this
soil
is
2.6
and
depth
of
root
zone
of
the
crop
is
60
centimeter .
Now
in
this
question, we are given total soil mass that is 500 gram.
Then,
that
sample
was
kept
for
drying
for
24
hours,
then
its
weight
is
reduced
that
is
dry
weight
of
the
dry
soil
is
400
gram
and
the
specific
gravity
of
the
soil
is
2.6,
depth
for
which
we
will
be
finding
out
the
values
in
the
soil
sample
that
is
for
60
centimeter .
And
the
core
volume,
core
cutter ,
volume
or
core
sampler
volume
is
3
into
10
is
to
power
minus
4
cubic
meter .
Now
from
these given data, we will work out moisture content by weight basis.
We
will
find
out
bulk
density ,
we
will
determine
dry
density
of
the
soil,
we
will
find
out
what
is
the
equivalent
depth
of
water
in
60
centimeter
root
zone
of
the
crop.
And
we
will
work
out
what
is the void ratio of this soil? What is the porosity of the soil and degree of saturation?
So,
let
us
try
to
do
this
particular
solve
this
problem.
So,
mass
of
wet
soil
is
0.5
kg,
it
is
given
we
are
given
after
drying
that
is
0.4
kg.
And
then
volume
is
3
into
10
is
to
power
minus
4
cubic
meter ,
a
specific
gravity
of
the
soil
is
2.6
depth
of
root
zone
is
0.6
meter .
So,
moisture
content
on
weight
basis
or
we
can
say
gravimetric
soil
moisture
content
is
means
the
mass
of
water
in
the
soil sample, because we have been given the total soil mass, the weight of the dry soil mass.
a) Moisture content (
θ
m
) of soil on weight basis
Mass of water in soil sample (M
w
) = M
s
- M
d
=
0.5 – 0.4 = 0.1 kg
Therefore, Moisture content (
θ
m
) =𝑀𝑤𝑀𝑑= 0.10.4=0.25 
Moisture content (%) = 25
So,
weight
of
water
is
0.1
kg
or
we
can
say
100
gram.
Now ,
when
we
want
to
find
out
moisture
content
by
this
weight
basis,
so
this
can
be
given
mass
of
water
is
0.1
gram,
mass
of
dry
soil
is
0.1
kg
and
then
mass
of
dry
soil
is
0.4
kg,
so
this
is
equal
to
0.25.
So,
moisture
content
by
gravimetric method is 25%, so this is the answer one of this question.
Second part, it is asked what is the bulk density of the soil? So, bulk density is defined asb) Bulk density of soil (
ρ
b
)
ρ
b
=
=𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙𝑀𝑠𝑉𝑇 = 0.5
3×10−4 =1666.66 𝑘𝑔
𝑚3 
Dry
density ,
just
simply
here
we
will
be
using
mass
of
dry
soil
divided
by
total
volume
of
soil.
So, mass of dry soil is given as
c) Dry density (
ρ
d
)
ρ
d
=
=𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑟𝑦 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙𝑀𝑑𝑉𝑇 = 0.4
3×10−4 =1333.33 𝑘𝑔
𝑚3
Now ,
when
we
want
to
find
out
equivalent
depth
of
water
in
the
soil
root
zone
or
we
can
say
when
we
are
considering
60
centimeter
of
the
soil
column.
So,
what
is
the
volume
of
water
which
is
available?
So,
volume
of
water
in
60
centimeter
soil
column.
So
first
let
us
see
that
we
have
been
given
theta
m
we
have
calculated
that
is
0.25
and
then
density
of
the
soil
that
we
have
got
the
dry
density
of
the
soil
that
is
rho
d
by
and
then
we
know
what
is
the
density
of
water
that
is 1000 kg per cubic meter .
So,
d) Equivalent depth of water in the soil root zone (d)
Volumetric moisture content can be determine as
θ
v
= θ
m×ρ𝑑ρ𝑤 =0.25×1333.331000 =0.333 
Therefore, Equivalent depth (d) = 
θ
v
depth
of root zone×
d = 0.3333
60 = 20 cm×
This water is 20 centimeter in 60 centimeter of soil column.
Void
ratio
is
another
important
parameter
of
this
soil.
And
in
this
question,
we
are
given
certain
parameter we will use to compute the void ratio. So, void ratio is given bye) Void ratio (e)
e=𝑉𝑣𝑉𝑠 
Volume of solid (V
s
) =
10
-4
m
3𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙 × 𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=0.42.6 ×1000=1.538×
Volume of void (V
v
) = V
T
– V
s
=
10
-4
) - (
10
-4
) = 1.462
10
-4
m
3(3×1.538××
Therefore,  e=1.462×10−4
1.538×10−4=0.95
So
when
we
are
dividing
the
volume
of
void
with
the
volume
of
solid
then
we
get
the
void
ratio
as 0.95. So, this is the answer for of void ratio in the given question.
Porosity
is
another
parameter ,
it
is
important
parameter
which
is
it
matters
when
we
deal
with
the
water
movement
in
the
soil,
when
we
supply
water
through
drip
irrigation
system.
So,
porosity
plays
an
important
role,
and
so
when
we
want
to
calculate
porosity ,
this
porosity
is
given
by
volume
of
void
divided
by
total
volume
of
the
soil
sample.
So,
this
total
volume
of
the
soil
sample
is
already
given
to
us
in
the
question
that
is
the
volume
of
core
sampler
and
volume
of
void, we have calculated this value.
f) Porosity (n)
n =𝑉𝑣𝑉𝑇 =1.462×10−4
3×10−4 =0.487 
So, the porosity of the soil in the given question is 0.487.
Degree
of
saturation,
degree
of
saturation
is
defined
by
the
ratio
of
volume
of
water
divided
by
volume
of
void.
So,
volume
of
water
can
be
computed
by
taking
the
mass
of
water ,
this
divided
by
the
density
of
water
and
then
volume
of
void
already
we
have
calculated.
So,
mass
of
water
we have already got that is 0.1 kg and density of water we know 1000 kg per cubic meter .
g) Degree of saturation (S
r
)
𝑆𝑟=𝑉𝑤𝑉𝑣 =(𝑀𝑤ρ𝑤)
𝑉𝑣 =(0.11000)
1.462×10−4=0.683When
we
work
out
numerical
the
substitution
of
these
values,
we
get
degree
of
saturation
is
0.683.
Now
0.683,
it
is
the
value
which
we
say
that
68.3%
is
the
saturation
level
in
the
given
soil
sample.
So,
this
is
a
important
value
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
various
soil
moisture
constant
or
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
saturated
soil
sample,
when
we
deal
with
the
field
capacity ,
when we deal with the wilting point or available water content.
So,
in
this
particular
tutorial,
we
have
worked
out
the
numerical
problems
related
with
simply
unit
conversion.
We
have
dealt
application
of
basic
concept
of
fluid
mechanics
where
we
use
continuity
equation,
where
we
use
the
energy
equation
that
is
the
Bernoulli
equation,
when
we
deal
with
the
physical
properties
of
soil
like
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil,
when
we
deal
with
the porosity , bulk density , particle density , void ratio or degree of saturation.
So,
such
are
what
is
the
depth
of
water?
So,
these
conversion
from
the
gravimetric
moisture
content
into
volumetric
water
content
such
type
of
concept
we
dealt
in
these
examples.
So,
for
your
practice
I
hope
you
have
understood
these
things.
Now
in
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
discuss concept of evapotranspiration that will be dealt in the coming class.
Now ,
to
these
problems
you
can
refer
books,
these
books
can
be
used
as
your
textbook

subject
particularly

topics.
