Lectur e - 53 
Automation of Micr o Irrigation System (Part – 3)
Yes
dear
participants,
I
welcome
you
to
the
lecture
53.
Lecture
53
is
on
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system;
we
divided
the
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system
in
4
parts.
So,
first
2
parts
we
discussed.
So,
if
you
remember
in
the
first
two
parts,
we
discussed
about
why
to
automate
micro
irrigation
system,
what
are
the
role
of
ICT
and
IoT
in
micro
irrigation
automation,
types
of
micro
irrigation
automation,
parameters
of
MI
automation
and
their
components.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
are
discussing
about
networks
for
data
communication
and
software's,
controller
program,
database,
and
graphical
user
interface.
This
will
be
the
components
in
this
particular
lecture.
So,
as
I
told
you
that
network
could
be
wireless
or
wired
or
hybrid
of
both
for
data
communication
and
then
software,
controller ,
program,
database,
and
GUI this will be the content of this particular lecture.
So,
just
starting
now,
this
particular
slide
basically
it
is
giving
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
different
types
of
network
which
are
used
for
data
communication.
So,
what
do
we
mean
by
the
data
communication?
Data
communication
refers
to
the
transmission
of
digital
data
between
2
or
more
nodes
means
here
this
could
be
connected
with
the
computer ,
tab,
sensors,
controller ,
and
mobile
devices.
There
could
be
several
devices
it
could
be
connected
with
the
network.
So,
this
is the part which we call it as data communication.
So,
when
we
are
talking
about
micro
irrigation
which
is
precision
irrigation
and
automation,
micro
irrigation
is
data
centric
approach
it
requires
real
time
field
data.
These
real
time
means
what
is
the
current
status
of
soil
moisture
content,
what
are
the
weather
data
which
are
there.
So,
atmospheric
temperature,
relative
humidity ,
wind,
atmospheric
pressure
there
could
be
no
doubtseveral
data
and
those
data
are
used
to
correlate
and
then
used
for
further
processing
and
operating the system.
It
involves
the
employment
of
these
sensors
to
monitor
the
real
time
data
and
making
useful
information
means
using
those
data
from
the
sensor
for
planning
irrigation
should
we
wait
for
few
hours
or
should
we
give
irrigation
next
day,
today
it
does
not
require,
such
type
of
information
will
be
used
after
getting
the
data
from
the
sensors.
The
physical
connection
between
the
networks
computing
device
is
established
using
it
could
be
either
wire
or
by
using
the
cables
or
without
cable
or
wireless
or
it
could
be
combination
of
both
means
some
part
it
can
be wireless and some part we are getting data by using the wire or cable system.
So,
when
we
talk
of
physical
connections,
these
physical
connections
could
be
of
2
types,
it
could
be
wired
connection,
it
can
be
wireless
connection.
And
then
these
could
be
involves
a
particular
type
of
arrangement,
how
the
data
are
in
different
nodes
they
are
arranged.
So,
here
network
topology
is
used.
What
is
network
topology?
Network
topology
it
refers
to
the
manner
in
which
links
and
nodes
of
a
network
are
arranged
to
relate
each
other ,
how
they
are
connected,
and how they are means the relationship exists between them.
So,
a
network
topology
diagram
helps
to
visualize
communicating
devices
which
are
modeled
as
nodes
and
connections
between
devices
which
are
modeled
as
the
links
between
the
nodes.
So,
how
they
are
connected
and
then
what
is
the
link
between
them
they
are
used
in
this
particular
thing.
So,
these
network
topology
it
could
be
a
star
topology ,
it
could
be
bus
topology ,
it
can
be
ring
topology .
All
these
have
got
their
own
meaning.
So,
mesh
or
hybrid
means
a
combination
of
all these or combination of 2 or more.
So,
when
it
says
that
is
star
topology .
So,
when
we
talk
about
the
different
types
of
network
topology ,
so,
when
this
is
a
star
topology
one
of
them
here
each
device
you
can
see
here,
it
looks
like
a
star
and
all
these
nodes
are
connected
with
a
hub.
So,
each
device
or
nodes
in
the
network
is
connected
to
the
central
device
which
is
known
as
a
hub.
Now ,
a
star
topology
does
not
allowdirect
communication
between
the
node
means
it
does
not
so,
one
say
here
the
node
1
is
not
connected with the node 2 so, it does not transmit information from one to other .
Rather
information
which
is
coming
to
the
hub
and
then
hub
will
connect
it
will
be
connected
with
the
2
and
then
pass
on
information
too.
So,
if
one
node,
if
one
device
or
node
wants
to
send
data
to
other
device
or
node
it
has
to
first
send
the
data
to
the
hub
then
hub
will
transfer
the
data
to
the
designated
node
or
device.
So,
this
is
the
arrangement.
So,
here
we
can
see
here,
let
us
say
that
it
could
hear
it
is
being
shown
as
5,
it
could
be
more
than
5.
So,
there
will
be
5
nodes
and
then the data from each unit each node is being received by the hub and then it is transmitting.
So,
bus
topology
is
another
way
of
arrangement.
Here,
in
the
bus
topology
it
consists
of
the
main
cable
and
they
are
arranged
in
a
proper
sequence,
proper
order
which
looks
as
if
they
are
in
order
or
series
they
follow
and
then
it
is
in
the
bus
manner
and
then
there
is
a
drop
line.
So,
in
a
bus
topology ,
there
is
a
main
cable
and
all
the
devices
are
connected
to
this
main
cable
through
drop
line.
So,
node
1,
node
2,
node
3,
node
4
all
these
what
we
see
there
is
a
drop
line
which
is
joining
with
the
main
cable.
So,
here
all
the
data
are
transmitted
over
the
main
cable,
there
is
a
limit
of
drop
lines
and
requires
distance
for
the
main
cable
means
main
cable
requires
a
distance
as
well
as
the
length
will
depend
upon
the
how
many
number
of
nodes
are
being
used
in
this
type
topology .
Ring
if
you
see
here,
it
follows
a
particular
manner
means
it
follows
as
if
it
is
in
the
circular
manner .
So,
data
from
node
1
it
goes
to
node
2
then
it
takes
from
the
node
2
to
node
3,
from
node
3
to
node
4
like
this
and
there
could
be
more
than
5.
So,
in
the
ring
topology
each
device
is
connected
with
2
devices
on
either
side
of
it,
either
side
of
it
means
one
is
connected
with
2
and
then
one
is
also
connected
with
the
node
5.So,
in
this
system,
device
sends
data
to
another
but
in
one
direction.
Each
device
in
the
ring
topology
has
a
repeater .
If
the
received
data
is
intended
for
other
device,
then
repeater
forward
this
data
until
the
intended
device
receives
it.
So,
this
is
the
way the ring topology it works.Mesh
topology .
So,
in
the
case
of
mesh
topology ,
we
can
see
here
that
node
1
is
connected
with
the
node
2,
node
1
is
connected
with
the
node
3,
node
1
is
connected
with
the
node
4,
and
node
1
is
connected
with
the
node
5.
So,
this
is
the
types
of
all
nodes
are
connected
with
the
other
nodes.
So,
each
device
or
node
is
connected
to
every
other
device
node
on
the
network
through
dedicated point to point link.
Network
consisting
of
n
number
of
node
must
connect
with
n
minus
1
number
nodes
means
say
this
1
it
will
be
connected
with
the
4
excluding
its
own,
so,
n
minus
1
so,
we
can
say
total
number
of
links
in
a
mesh
topology
will
be
n
that
is
the
total
number
of
nodes
multiplied
by
n
minus
1
divided
by
2.
So,
simply
I
can
say
the
total
number
of
links
say
in
this
case
it
will
be
5
multiplied
by
4
divided
by
2.
So,
this
will
give
5
into
4
20
divided
by
2.
So,
total
number
of
links
in this 5 nodes mesh topology will be 10.
Hybrid
topology
means
it
is
a
combination
of
2
or
more
topology
is
known
as
hybrid
topology .
Ease
of
scalability
as
we
can
connect
new
computing
network
with
existing
networks
with
the
different
topology .
So,
we
can
see
here,
it
is
a
ring
topology
and
this
is
a
star
topology .
So,
and
they
can
be
when
both
of
them
they
are
used.
So,
such
type
of
topology
is
known
as
hybrid
topology .
Ease
of
scalability
we
can
connect
a
new
means
computing
network
with
existing
network
with
different
topology ,
this
is
the
case
and
in
real
sense
when
we
are
using
so,
we
are
using such type of topology in the system.
Having
learned
the
different
types
of
topology
there
are
different
types
of
protocols
which
is
followed
in
the
networking
and
this
protocol
is
an
established
set
of
rules
means
there
are
set
of
rules
which
is
followed
to
determine
how
data
is
transmitted
between
different
devices
in
the
same
network.
So,
it
allows
connected
devices
to
communicate
with
each
other
regardless
of
any
differences in their internal processes.
A
structure
or
design
similar
to
the
way
that
is
speaking
the
same
language
simplifies
communication
between
2
people
means,
language
which
means
the
idea,
this
one,
that
same
kind
of
data
which
are
used
or
2
different
kinds
of
data
which
is
used.
So,
when
we
arecommunicating
each
other .
So,
similar
to
the
way
that
is
speaking
the
same
language
simplifies
communication between 2 people.
Network
protocols
make
it
possible
for
the
devices
to
interact
with
each
other
because
of
predetermined
rules
built
into
the
devices,
software
and
hardware.
There
are
some
standard
organization
or
institution
which
are
using
the
different
types
of
protocols
and
they
are
designated
for
the
different
this
kind
of
things.
So,
this
is
Institute
of
Electrical
and
Electronics
Engineers
IEEE
is
one
Institution
Organization
then
Internet
Engineering
Task
Force
IETF .
Then
the
International
Organization
for
Standardization
that
is
ISO.
This
is
in
Switzerland
headquarters
available
in
Switzerland,
and
then
the
International
Telecommunication
Union
ITU,
the
World
Wide
Web
Consortium
W3C.
These
are
the
groups
or
organization
which
are
operating, setting the rules.
There
are
different
types
of
network
protocols.
So,
one
is
the
communication
protocols,
another
one
is
security
protocol,
and
management
protocols.
So,
communication
protocols,
these
protocols
formally
described
the
format
or
and
rules
by
which
data
is
transferred
over
the
network.
Communication
protocols
also
handle
authentication
and
error
detection
as
well
as
syntax
the
synchronization
of
the
communication
i.e.
semantics
so,
we
call
it
as
HTTP
that
is
Hypertext
Transfer
Protocol.
Or
when
we
say
TCP
these
are
the
terms
which
we
are
using.
So,
transmission
control
protocol.
So,
this
is
falling
and
these
types
of
protocols
are
known
as
communication protocols.
Security
protocols
this
type
of
protocol
ensures
no
unauthorized
users,
services,
devices,
access
your
network
data
and
this
works
across
all
data
types
and
network
medium
being
used.
So,
network
security
protocols
rely
on
encryptions
and
cryptography
to
secure
data
so
that
only
a
special algorithms, formula and logical keys can make this data.
Now ,
the
examples
are
SSL
that
is
the
secure
socket
layer
or
HTTPS
that
is
a
secure
hypertext
transfer
protocol.
So,
these
are
means
these
protocols
which
we
read
these
are
falling
under
thesecurity
protocols
means
one
cannot
enter
in
the
network.
So,
these
protocols
are
being
maintained.
Management
protocols
is
we
come
across
the
term
called
SNMP
that
is
a
Simple
Network
Management
Protocol
or
ICMP .
So,
such
type
of
protocols
are
known
as
a
management
protocol
and
management
protocol
helps
to
define
the
policy
procedure
used
to
monitor ,
manage,
and
maintain
computer
network
that
is
essential
for
the
stable
communication
and
optimal
performance across the board. So, that is the meaning of the management protocol.
Here,
means
from
this
particular
diagram
we
are
learning
that
how
the
wireless
sensor
it
works
and
that
is
how
the
automation
is
being
done.
So,
we
see
here
this
is
the
farm
land
1
and
then
data
communication
we
can
see
here
the
arrows
are
critically
that
is
the
how
the
data
are
communicating.
So,
we
have
a
farm
land
1
where
the
sensor
is
being
used
and
from
the
data
it
is
transferring
by
using
the
sensors,
controller
and
actuator .
So,
it
goes
to
the
node
to
different
nodes
and
then
what
is
that?
That
it
is
giving
an
instruction
it
comes
to
the
base
station.
So,
node
one
means
here
it
is
your
node
1
and
then
it
comes
to
the
base
station
from
the
node
1
then
it
will
go
to
the
base
station,
and
from
the
base
station
the
data
are
coming
to
the
node
2
where
again
sensors and means your data controllers are there.
The
data
which
are
required
it
will
go
to
the
sensor
of
your
server
and
it
will
be
stored
and
then
means
based
on
the
communication
we
will
give
to
the
server ,
it
will
again
come
to
the
base
station
and
then
it
will
transfer
to
the
farm
land
and
communication
it
is
done.
So,
wireless
sensor
network
allows
faster
positioning
and
integration
of
different
types
of
sensors
as
most
of
these
networks
provide
self
configuration
and
self
organizing,
self
healing
and
self
diagnosing,
capabilities to sensor nodes.
So,
sensor
node,
this
is
one
sensor
node,
which
has
got
node
1
and
this
is
another
sensor
node
2
and
then
finally ,
it
is
being
the
information
which
you
find
here
that
it
will
come
here.
So,
sensor
data
are
transmitted,
then
it
goes
there
and
then
the
pump
or
electric
motor
whatever
is
there
it
will
actuate
based
on
the
control.
So,
communication
via
so,
this
could
follow
a
particular
type
of
system
that
is
your
WSN
W
means
Wi
Fi,
Wi
Max,
Bluetooth
mobile
network
depending
on
thatwill
be
used
to
do
the
instruction
and
then
the
data
will
be
accordingly
programmed
and
then
it
will do like this.
So,
when
we
call
it
a
wireless
sensor
network
based
automation
commonly
used
technologies
could
be
LoRa,
ZigBee,
WiFi,
Bluetooth,
GPRS,
3G
can
be
3G,
4G,
and
5G.
Now
5G
likely
to
come
and
then
your
worldwide
the
interoperability
for
Microwave
Access
that
is
WiMAX.
So,
these
are
the
standard
for
these
the
commonly
used
technologies.
So,
a
standard
for
this
if
it
is
LoRa, it is coming under the IEEE.
So,
according
to
the
IEEE
the
frequency
bandwidth
is
a
specified
in
this
range
that
is
a
433
megahertz
to
868
megahertz
that
is
used
in
Europe
and
then
like
this
particularly
for
our
India
IEEE
has
specified
the
frequency
band
for
the
LoRa
it
is
in
between
865
to
867
megahertz.
It
has
got
the
transmission
speed
of
0.3
to
27
kilobyte
per
second
and
then
the
communication
range
is
10
Kilometer
plus
in
the
perfect
condition
power
it
requires
low
power
consumption
like
this
there are other commonly used communication technologies.
So,
this
could
be
the
ZigBee
so,
as
per
IEEE
this
particular
is
the
standard
it
follows
and
then
this
is
the
thing
then
WiFi,
this
is
another
free
standard.
So,
like
this
there
are
different
standards
and
accordingly
for
technologies
which
are
you
say
in
case
of
WiFi.
So,
WiFi,
is
being
according
to
the
IEEE
802.1 1
a.b.g.n
standard,
it
means
this
is
a
standard
which
follow
the
frequency
using
2.4
gigahertz
and
then
this
is
the
data
transmission
that
is
2
to
54
megabytes
per
second
and
this
is
the
communication
range
i.e.
20
meter
to
100
meter .
So,
if
you
look
into
the
different
locations
it
is
the
lower
right
hand
card
the
10
Kilometer
plus
and
here
it
is
in
this
case
the
Microwave
Access this is 50 kilometer practically 10 Kilometer . So, this is the way it is being expressed.
What
are
the
different
advantages
of
wireless
sensor
network?
It
is
easy
to
install
that
is
one
advantage.
So,
low
cost,
scalability
is
possible,
so
easy
to
install
means
a
quick
straightforward
installation
is
one
of
the
main
benefits
of
wireless
sensor
system
and
then
wireless
systems
areonly
viable
option
where
hard
writing
is
difficult
or
impractical.
For
example
remote,
large
agricultural fields, heritage building etcetera. This is another thing that this can be used.
Low
cost,
initial
installation
cost
and
components
are
cheaper
than
wire
technology
with
the
advancement
of
the
wireless
technology
in
the
long
run
and
maintenance
cost
is
also
low.
It
can
be
scalability
it
can
accommodate
any
new
nodes
or
devices
with
that
can
be
included
and
it
can
be implemented at a very short span of time.
The
other
features
of
the
wireless
or
sensor
network
is
self-or ganization
means
wireless
sensors
network
autonomously
determine,
it
is
a
very
known
configuration
parameters
including
addressing,
routing,
clustering,
positioning
and
then
power
control
etcetera.
It
has
got
flexibility
in
mobility
means
flexibility
in
the
sense
that
it
is
mobile
means
at
one
can
easily
reposition
sensors
to
get
a
stronger
signal
and
if
situation
demands
node
can
be
moved
in
a
limited
distance
without any additional changes.
There
are
some
challenges
in
wireless
sensors
networking,
those
challenges
are
to
be
addressed
by
researchers
and
then
that
has
to
be
taken
care
while
someone
is
using
wireless
sensor
networking.
So,
one
challenge
is
energy
consumption.
Power
consumption
is
one
of
the
main
issue.
Battery
or
solar
power
is
used
by
equipping
with
sensor
nodes.
So,
we
need
a
solar
panel
or
battery
and
then
there
are
some
places
where
such
problems
it
comes
so
the
availability
of
power , solar system that also a problem it comes.
Energy
consumption
mainly
depends
on
the
sensors
to
nodes
operation
like
communication,
set
sensing
and
communication
and
sensing
and
data
processing.
Clock
synchronization
it
is
serious
system
or
service
system
problem
in
the
wireless
access
network
the
main
function
of
the
synchronization
is
to
offer
an
ordinary
time
scale
for
the
nodes
of
local
clock
within
the
sensor
networks.
Such
clocks
must
be
synchronized
with
some
applications
like
monitoring
as
well
as
tracking means this should goes simultaneously .The
other
challenge
is
quality
of
service
means
an
interference.
So,
quality
of
service
means
quality
of
it
is
the
data
must
be
distributed
in
a
regular
timeframe
and
in
an
accurate
manner .
Because
some
of
the
real
time
sensor
data
sensor
based
application
mainly
dependent
on
time.
So,
if
the
error
free
data
is
not
distributed
on
time
towards
receiver ,
then
data
will
not
be
useful.
This
is
another
important
they
means
if
the
data
received
and
then
there
is
a
time
gap.
So,
this
may not be useful.
Then
interference
if
there
is
any
other
electronic
wave
like
high
voltage
electric
line
or
other
wireless
sensor
network
industrial
activity
that
involves
the
electromagnetic
waves
which
are
working
there
means
such
lines,
so
these
are
present
so,
they
are
likely
to
put
interference.
So,
this
should
be
taken
care
or
we
need
to
change
the
system
accordingly .
Physical
security
of
the
device
as
these
network
are
deployed
in
the
remote
or
unattended
areas.
There
is
a
high
chance
of
theft
external
natural
forces
as
well
as
human
and
animal.
So,
that
is
another
threat
means
threat
one
to
take
care
about
this
part.
So,
it
is
a
big
concern
to
protect
our
network
system.
Data
spoofing
any
wireless
network
is
very
high
risk
of
network
hacking
and
data
is
spoofing
and
this
is a common problem. So, this would be taken care while we are going for WSN.
Now ,
software
controller
program
database
and
graphical
user
interface.
So,
here
the
hardware
components
are
operated
by
software
and
there
are
mainly
4
components
that
are
used
in
modern
day
that
is
your
e-Agriculture
system
which
is
the
major
component
is
the
microcontroller
program,
cloud
platform,
database,
web
server
and
graphical
user
interface.
So,
microcontroller
program
is
a
programmable
IC
which
is
capable
of
multiple
function
depending
on
how
it
is
programmed.
So,
typically
they
are
programmed
with
the
high
level
languages
such
as
C++
or
Java
and
that
is
one
of
the
essential
tool
of
design
program
and
the
IC
means
your
integrated
development
environment
that
is
IDE,
so,
microcontrollers
means,
understand
assembly
language instruction the how there are instructions are set.
And
these
are
high
level,
this
involves
the
high
level
programming
languages.
And
these
this
could
be
uploaded
and
the
examples
of
the
microcontroller
is
Arduino
with
that
is
yourintegrated
development
environment
with
C++
program.
Cloud
Platform
allow
the
network
of
devices
to
be
operated
through
the
cloud
based
network
and
the
cloud
computing
is
the
on
demand
availability
of
the
computer
system
resources,
especially
data
storage
computing
power
without
direct
active
management
by
the
user.
So,
some
of
the
platform
these
cloud
platforms
are
Amazon
Web
Service,
IoT
platform,
Google
Cloud’ s
IoT
platform,
Microsoft
Azure
IoT
suite,
IBM Watson so these are the cloud platform which is being used now when the data size is lar ge.
Database
is
the
collection
of
the
information
that
these
data
are
organized
such
that
it
can
be
easily
accessed,
managed
and
updated.
Means
this
data
could
be
aggregation
of
the
set
of
files
then
means
or
it
could
be
used
data
record
and
then
typically
it
means
the
Data
Manager
database
manager
provides
user
the
ability
to
control,
read
or
write,
access
in
a
smart
irrigation,
micro
irrigation
systems,
sensor
data
are
stored
in
the
database
for
intelligent
decision
making
and
for
future
reference.
So,
these
databases
also
hold
current
status
of
actuators.
So,
these
database
examples
are
Oracle,
Microsoft
SQL
Server ,
MySQL
server
these
are
the
different
server which can be used for the database storage.
Web
Server
is
another
important
component,
web
server
is
the
computer
software
and
the
underlying
hardware
that
accept
request
via
HTTP .
The
network
protocol
created
to
distribute
web
pages
or
its
secure
variant
HTTPS.
A
user
agent
commonly
a
web
browser ,
a
web
crawler
initiates
communication
by
making
a
request
for
a
specific
resource,
HTTP
and
the
server
response
with
the
content
of
that
resource
or
an
error
message
server
can
also
accept
and
store
files.
In
e-Agriculture
end
user
make
requests
for
the
real
time
farm
land
data
that
is
served
by
this
web
server .
So,
end
user
can
also
monitor
and
control
actuators
by
making
a
request
through
web
server .
So,
examples
are
Apache,
IIS,
nginx,
GWS
Cloudflare
these
are
the
examples
of
this
one.
Now ,
here
what
you
see
the
graphical
user
interface
means
instead
of
giving
the
data
or
files
or
text,
this
is
in
the
graphical
way
it
can
be
shown,
that
becomes
for
any
person
to
use,
understand
properly
even
a
farmer
can
operate.
So,
GUI
displays
object
that
conveys
information
andrepresent
action
that
can
be
taken
by
the
user.
So,
this
is
in
the
interactive
mode,
this
works
to
object
changing
the
color ,
size
visibility ,
so
that
it
can
be
easily
you
see
just
what
you
are
seeing
here
and
the
soil
moisture
content
it
is
being
shown
here
this
the
humidity
and
we
can
so
here
the
temperature
data.
So,
such
type
of
information,
this
is
displayed
and
that
becomes
the
graphical
user
friendly
system,
it
works.
So,
the
GUI
objects
include
icons,
cursors,
buttons
and
these
graphical
elements
are
sometime
enhanced
with
sound,
visual
effects,
budging
sound
or
visual
effects
like
transparency
and
drop
shadows,
apps,
web
pages
are
the
common
form
of
GUI
for
a
smart irrigation system.
So,
these
are
the
references
you
can
refer
the
references
for
more
detail
about
this
lecture.
And
we
discussed
in
this
particular
lecture
network
data
communication,
we
also
discussed
the
different
computer
program,
database,
graphical
user
interface
and
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
part 4 we will discuss about the other aspect of this particular system. Thank you very much.
