Solar  Photovoltaic System for  Irrigation (Part 2)
Hello
participants,
I
invite
you
to
lecture
49.
This
lecture
is
in
continuation
to
my
previous
lecture
on
solar
PV
system
for
irrigation.
This
is
part
two.
Here
we
will
emphasize
how
to
integrate
solar
PV
system
with
micro
irrigation.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture
we
will
discuss
about
controller ,
we
will
discuss
about
pumping
unit,
we
will
discuss
about
the
how
to
match
and properly integrate solar PV  system with micro irrigation system.
So,
a
controller
consists
of
a
maximum
power
point
tracking,
inverter
and
variable
frequency
drive
VFD,
in
short
form
we
say
VFD.
The
MPPT
that
is
a
maximum
power
point
tracking
maintain system operation at or near maximum available power .
The
power
which
we
are
getting
from
the
solar
panel,
in
this
particular
place
which
you
are
seeing
that
the
power
which
is
coming
from
the
solar
panel.
This
power
which
we
get,
this
power
is
DC
that
DC
is
supposed
to
be
converted
to
AC
in
order
to
operate
the
submersible
pump.
So,
when
we
want
this
particular
unit
it
goes
there
so
here,
we
have
got
a
VFD.
A
VFD
regulated
motor
speed
by
varying
the
motor
input
frequency
and
inverter
converts
direct
current into alternate current that is  AC current according to the type of load.
So,
finally
the
energy
is
supplied
from
the
solar
system
to
the
pump.
The
pumping
system
usually
consists
of
pump.
These
pumps
could
be
placed
at
the
surface
so
surface
centrifugal
pump
or
submersible
pump
means
it
is
placed
below
the
ground
level
and
then
the
water
is
being withdrawn when the there is a deeper depth of water available.
So,
variable
speed
pumps
are
powered
by
a
synchronous
motor
or
an
electronic
frequency
converter
that
allows
the
pump
to
work
under
different
angular
velocities.
And
frequency
converted
can
be
considered
as
an
inverter
which
is
able
to
modulate
the
output
signal
to
desired
frequency
and
amplitude.
Because
what
happened
that
power
supplied
by
the
PVarray
is
variable
means
during
day
time.
You
may
find
that
in
the
morning
solar
insulation
is
low
and
it
increases.
So,
it
increases
means
your
solar
insulation
when
it
increases
so
energy
available
is
also
increase.
So,
it
is
varying
due
to
that
is
another
part.
Also,
another
one
is
that
it
may
vary
due
to
cloud.
So
such
type
of
variability
will
happen
depending
on
the
incoming
radiation.
So,
power
required
by
the
pump
can
be
modified
by
modifying
the
angular
speed
of the pump to match the incoming power .
So,
it
is
very
important
thing
that
matching
of
the
pump
required
as
per
the
demand
and
then
how
much
power
it
is
available
that
is
coming
from
the
solar
PV
system.
So,
this
matching
is
a very crucial and important.
So,
to
select
the
most
appropriate
capacity
of
the
pump
for
a
particular
application,
the
performance
curve,
already
we
discussed
in
the
pump
class
and
previous
lecture
there
is
a
dischar ge-head-ef ficiency
curve
and
this
curve
is
established
between
these
parameters
of
the
pump
and
provided
by
the
manufacturer .
So,
pump
manufacturer
supplies
this
information.
This
relationship
is
governed
by
the
affinity
laws
that
relate
the
shaft
power ,
this
is
given
here,
this
will
relate
with
the
shaft
power ,
it
will
relate
with
the
available
head,
it
will
relate
with the dischar ge and also with the rotation speed.
So,
according
to
the
affinity
law
the
pump
dischar ge
that
is
ratio
of
original
dischar ge
to
the
pump dischar ge at a desired speed can be given by
Where,
Q
2
= pump dischar ge at desired speed N (Ls
-1
)
Q
1
= original pump dischar ge at speed N
1
(Ls
-1
)
N
2
= new pump speed desired (rpm)
N
1
= original pump speed at which the characteristics
are known (rpm)
H
2
= head at desired speed N
2
and dischar ge Q
2
H
1
= original head at speed N
1
P
2
= power at desired speed N
2
(kW)
P
1
= original power at speed N
1
(kW)
So, this is explained using the af finity law .
This
relationship
it
is
giving
us
valuable
information
while
we
are
selecting
the
pump.
This
is
another
important
characteristic
curve
which
you
can
see
here
that
how
the
head
and
dischar ge
it
varies
for
the
pump.
When
the
power
it
is
supplied
at
different
frequencies
and
when
the
pump
is
operating
at
different,
it
has
got
different
efficiency
so
you
can
see
the
typical
curve
which
is
available.
This
is
the
curve
giving
us
say
74.37%
is
the
efficiency
when
let
us
say
that
a
pump
is
delivering
dischar ge
it
is
delivering
dischar ge
of
4
litter
per
second.
And
it
has
a
100
meter
head
what
is
the
appropriate
efficiency .
So,
if
I
need
a
pump
of
this
particular
efficiency
accordingly
what
will
be
the
power
frequency
requirement
of
the
motor that can be decided?
Then
on
farm
irrigation
network
to
select
the
operating
point,
that
is
the
point
which
will
be
available
from
the
curve
we
will
get.
And
then
that
is
a
dischar ge
head
that
curve
which
I
was
telling
you
from
that
on
this
type
of
curve
of
the
PV
irrigation
system
it
is
a
function
of
power
supplied
by
the
PV
plant
not
only
the
simply
taking
the
head
dischar ge
of
the
pump
but also one has to see the network system curve, irrigation network system curve.
Now
two
different
cases
can
be
distinguished
depending
on
the
type
of
irrigation
system
which
we
are
using.
Say
case
one
which
when
we
are
telling
when
pump
is
operated
to
fill
the
tank
which
is
at
some
certain
elevation.
So,
here
one
can
find
out
what
is
the
total
head?
So, total head H will be means from the curve we will be getting total head will be given by
where
=
the
elevation
difference
between
the
groundwater
level
in
the
well
and
the
water
level
inùëß
the elevated tank
h
f
= the friction head losses throughout the dischar ge
pipe system.
So,
this
elevation
difference
one
has
to
find
out
that
when
the
pump
is
being
used
and
how
much head it will be required to fill the tank which is at some certain elevation.
The
other
case
is,
it
is
directly
supplying
water
to
the
irrigation
network
which
is
used
in
drip
irrigation
or
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
In
case
of
drip
irrigation
system,
it
can
be
elevated
case
where
gravity
system
after
the
water
is
filled
in
then
gravity
system
is
used
to
operate
the
drip
system
which
is
of
low
head
drip
system.
But
for
larger
system
when
the
means
where
irrigation
is
to
begin
for
a
very
large
area
then
it
is
directly
the
means
irrigation
system
is
directly
connected
with
the
pump.
So,
for
a
sprinkler
it
requires
normally
a
larger
pressure
so pump is needed. So, the system curve can be calculated by using the following relationship
where
h
o
=
the
head
required
to
operate
irrigation
network
(includes
emitter
operating
head,
friction
losses in pipelines and other components ).
Where
drippers
are
there
or
sprinklers
or
micro
sprinklers
or
the
overhead
sprinklers
are
there
so
how
much
pressure
it
requires
to
operate
plus
frictional
loss
in
the
pipeline
and
all
that
take care of by hf.
So,
there
are
other
design
parameters
which
needs
to
be
considered
while
we
are
designing
the
system.
These
are
the
following
design
steps
one
has
to
follow
for
sizing
the
PV
system
and
pumping
system.
So,
first
is
to
determine
the
water
production
goal.
Water
production
goal means it is simply water requirement of the crop.
So,
we
studied
in
the
water
requirement
of
crop
a
particular
in
the
previous
lectures.
If
you
remember
how
to
estimate
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop
by
using
different
methods
I
discussed.
So,
pan
evaporation
method
is
one
method
but
here
it
is
given
highest
water
need.
So,
suppose
we
have
got
the
crop
which
is
grown
it
is
a
perennial
crop
or
it
is
a
crop which is to be grown during summer month.
So,
water
requirement
during
summer
month
when
it
is
during
the
peak
period
that
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
So,
if
the
same
crop
is
grown
for
last
few
years
so
those
data
are
to
be
analysed
say
and
then
one
can
take
5
years
recurrence
interval
what
is
the
maximum
water
or
evapotranspiration
needed
by
the
crop
during
peak
period
means
when
it
is
in
the
high
demand
period.
That
is
to
be
taken
in
the
design
side
then
another
part
is
considering
that
what
time
of
the
day
and
what
is
the
wattage
available
at
that
time.
So,
use
the
design
month
insulation
that
is
1
sun
means
the
hours
at
1
sun.
Hours
at
one
sun
is
for
the
design
purpose
it
is
taken
as
1000
watt
per
square
meter
for
1
solar
hour.
So,
that
is
the
value
which
is
considered for the design purpose.
So,
this
we
are
calculating
Q
that
is
the
design
dischar ge
will
be
daily
demand
divided
by
insulation multiplied by 60.
So,
this
we
will
get
the
value
of
Q
now
find
the
value
of
Q
that
is
the
dynamic
head
versus
dischar ge
at
particular
dischar ge.
So,
this
we
will
get
this
particular
relationship
what
is
the
value of H. So, we will find out the capacity of the desired head and for a given flow rate.
So,
we
will
get
the
value
of
how
many
number
of
modules
it
is
needed
and
these
modules
when
as
I
discussed
told
you
that
they
are
given
in
series
and
parallel
to
get
the
maximum
powers. So, number of modules in series can be calculated by
When we are interest to find out the PV  strings in parallel, this can be given by
So,
these
values
are
available
how
much
it
is
there
so
we
one
can
find
out
the
how
much
is
the
value
which
is
for
the
you
know
in
the
parallel
and
this
so
that
one
can
find
out
the
number of strings in parallel.
And then power input in kilowatt it can be given by this also expression
So,
once
the
PV
capacity
is
known
suitable
controller
of
equal
or
greater
size
than
pump
rating
can
be
selected.
And
also,
according
to
the
maximum
current
and
voltage
of
PV
system
and pump the cable and switches depending on the field requirement they can be selected.
Now
there
are
other
expressions
which
are
important
when
we
are
computing.
So,
solar
PV
system
power
calculation
is
made
so
we
are
calculating
for
the
maximum
power
by
using
this
expression which is given by
So,
this
particular
equation
it
is
developed
for
the
set
condition
at
25
degree
Celsius
the
operating cell temperature can be estimated by using this expression.
Where,
P
n
= nominal capacity of PV  system (kW)
= temperature coef ficient of drop in powerŒ≥
T
cell
= operating cell temperature (
o
C)
T
amb
= ambient temperature (
o
C)
NOCT  = nominal operating cell temperature (
o
C)
G = solar irradiance (W  m
-2
)
NOCT
is
provided
by
the
manufacturer
and
so
we
will
work
out
this
value.
So,
we
will
work
out
this
value
and
this
is
for
a
particular
time
of
the
day.
So,
this
we
will
work
out
and
G
is
the
solar
irradiance
this
also
for
a
particular
time
of
the
day.
So,
one
can
work
out
what
is
the
P max available at the particular period.
Now
here
we
are
integrating
the
system
with
the
solar
PV
system
with
the
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
this
integration
it
involve
that
you
can
see
here
this
one
is
this
source
of
energy
it
is
supplying
the
solar
energy
and
then
with
this
particular
solar
energy
it
is
generating
energy
and
that
is
in
DC.
So,
we
need
to
convert
by
using
the
VFD
that
is
a
variable
frequency .
So,
we
are
converting
it.
If
the
generated
energy,
which
we
are
generating
more,
then
this
can
be
feedback
to
the
grid
supply .
If
it
is
more
than
the
desired
value
then
it
can
be
also
stored
separately .
And
then
again
when
it
is
needed
during
night
time
or
any
other
time
this
can
be
supplied
or
when
there
is
a
problem
if
there
is
a
raining
or
some
cloud
condition
exist
at
that
time this can be done.
Now
by
using
the
VFD,
we
are
supplying
the
power
to
the
motor
and
then
the
pump
is
supplying
water
to
the
irrigation
system.
So,
pump
is
dischar ging,
the
interesting
part
here
it
is
that
the
power
generated
from
the
sun
it
is
a
variable
and
it
is
not
fixed
for
the
whole
day
period.
So,
during
daytime,
diurnal
period
itself
you
can
see
it
is
going
peak
and
initially
it
will be going slow and then it will go to peak again then again it will go down.
So,
the
science
involved
or
the
main
part
it
is
involved
is
not
simply
direct
coupling,
one
has
to
know
that
how
the
dischar ge
means
power
available
or
dischar ge
available
from
the
pump
which
will
generate
the
pressure
that
pressure
matches
with
the
requirement
of
the
pressure
at
which
when
we
are
operating
or
connecting
with
the
drip
irrigation
system
or
micro
sprinkler
system
or
sprinkler
irrigation
system
it
will
depend.
So
this
is
where
an
important
aspect
is
involved
how
to
use
the
available
power
or
head
pressure
for
operating
the
system.
Because
the
dischar ge
from
a
drip
emitter ,
dischar ge
from
a
sprinkler
system,
it
is
a
function
of
operating
pressure.
So,
dischar ge
will
increase
or
decrease
depending
on
the
pressure
available.
We
have
installed
SPV
based
micro
irrigation
system
this
particular
system
is
supported
by
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Farmers
Welfare,
GoI.
Now
there
are
16
panels
each
panel
is
of
320
watt
capacity
vision
and
then
this
system
is
standalone
system
it
is
a
single
axis
sun
tracking
with
grid
storage
arrangement.
The
total
system
it
converts
total
energy
is
of
the
order
of
5.12
kilowatt
power
which
is
being
used
to
operate
5
horsepower
submersible
pump
which
is
located
at
30
meters
below
the
ground
level.
The
pump
capacity
as
well
as;
we
have
an
arrangement
for
the
data
logging
which
is
being
used
by
using
the
GPRS
where
the
data
logging
for
the
solar
radiation,
temperature,
and
flow
rate
at
every
3
minute
interval
is
being
monitored. The system this particular system was installed in December 2017.
Now
strategies
for
integrating
solar
PV
and
micro
irrigation
system
to
regulate
system
and
to
optimize
use
of
generated
energy
for
irrigating
the
crop
is
to
design
more
than
one
irrigationunit
in
the
field.
Means
we
need
to
see
that
the
whether
we
need
to
supply
water
for
at
one
unit
or
more
than
one
unit.
So,
whole
farm
can
be
divided
into
number
of
unit
so,
that
the
available system can be ef fectively utilized.
And
then
whole
energy
which
is
available
from
the
field
it
can
be
used
for
irrigation
and
then
cost
of
the
system
can
be
also
reduced.
So,
when
farm
is
divided
into
the
number
of
subunit
greater
than
one.
The
dischar ge
and
power
needed
to
irrigate
each
unit
can
be
obtained
by
dividing
the
maximum
dischar ge
and
the
maximum
power
by
the
number
of
sub-unit
and
according to the power availability the units can be irrigated.
So,
in
this
case
system
can
start
irrigating
with
the
shaft
power
that
is
the
ns
and
time
lower
than
when
the
only
one
subunit
is
considered.
Two
different
strategies
can
be
utilized
one
strategy
to
irrigate
with
only
one
irrigation
subunit
in
operation
or
to
irrigate
with
multiple
irrigation
subunits.
Subunits
in
operation
that
is
operated
simultaneously .
This
is
a
typical
you
can
see
how
the
solar
insulation
during
a
day
time
in
different
season
it
varies.
So,
you
can
see
here
this
is
the
total
sunshine
hour
we
are
putting
it
say
from
6:30
means
some
places
this
it
goes
till
late
7:30
or
so
in
the
evening
time
but
you
can
see
the
maximum
power
available
is
between
12‚Äôo
clock
to
1‚Äôo
clock.
So,
this
particular
curve
it
is
for
winter
where
the
minimum ener gy is available.
And
then
solar
energy
is
available
and
then
this
red
curve
which
you
see
that
is
for
the
maximum.
So,
this
is
during
summer
month
and
then
the
autumn
and
spring
they
are
falling
in
between
winter
and
during
summer .
So,
this
is
a
variable
so
solar
insulation
it
varies
so
power
availability
will
be
also
vary
pump
dischar ge
will
vary
that
is
where
the
important
part
is how to match this varying solar intensity with the pump part.
So,
this
is
the
one
layout
it
has
been
shown
here
there
is
field
where
the
pump
is
located.
And
then
from
the
pump
the
main
line
and
then
from
the
main
sub-main
line
is
there.
And
then
there
are
the
sub-main
manifold
that
some
main
is
connected
with
the
manifold.
And
then
from
the
manifold
the
laterals
are
attached.
So,
this
is
one
layout
which
is
given
here.
So,
from
these
2
C
main
pipeline
from
C
to
B
there
is
a
sub
main
pipeline
and
from
B
to
A
there
is
a
manifold
and
on
these
manifold
laterals
are
attached.
The
other
strategy
means
your
submains
are
laid
in
this
way
and
on
which
the
sub
main
and
laterals
are
attached
this
is
another
strategy or layout is given that from the pump.
The
main
pipeline
is
attached
that
these
2
C
is
brought
here
and
then
this
is
your
main.
Sub
main
pipeline
and
then
sub
main
manifold
it
is
the
length
of
the
manifold
is
reduced
and
then
the
length
of
lateral
is
increased.
So,
this
could
be
the;
another
way
and
one
has
to
find
out
the
really
economics
and
amount
of
the
power
it
is
being
generated.
So,
this
can
be
another
strategy .
The
third
study
layout
it
can
be
made
that
pump
is
you
know
this
will
source
of
well
it
is
located
somewhere
in
the
middle.
Then
from
there
the
main
line
is
connected
and
from
main
the
sub
main
and
manifold,
sub
main
manifold
it
is
there.
And
from
there
the
laterals
are
connected
so
there
can
be
another
strategy .
So,
there
can
be
the
different
layout.
And
strategy it can be made depending on the field requirement.
Only
thing
that
one
has
to
see
in
all
the
unit
that
head
loss
due
to
friction
is
minimum
and
we
are
saving
energy.
So,
that
we
can
select
the
minimum
number
of
panels
and
we
can
economize
the
cost
and
the
pump
will
be
also
of
lesser
capacity
lesser
horsepower .
So,
it
will
be also economical so, there are several ways one can work out the economics part.
A
solar
irrigation
pump
system
method
needs
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
demand
for
irrigation
system
water
will
vary
throughout
the
year
this
is
what
you
have
seen
from
the
graph
which
I
was
showing.
That
the
demand
will
increase
because
the
power
supply
will
be
also
changed
so
peak
demand
during
the
irrigation
system
is
often
more
than
the
twice
the
average
demand.
Yes,
it
is
correct
this
will
depend
upon
the
of
course
at
what
time
of
the
season
we
are
considering
and
then
at
what
growth
stage
we
are
considering.
At
the
initial
stage
it
is
too
low
and
when
it
is
in
the
peak
demand
stage
when
it
is
a
fully
developed
crop
maturity
stage
the
demand
will
increase.
This
means
that
the
solar
pumps
for
irrigation
are
underutilized for most of the time in a year .
This
is
correct
that
initial
part
it
is
less
but
so
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
system
of
irrigation
water
distribution
and
application
to
the
crops.
We
need
to
see
that
here
if
the
demand
is
less
then
we
need
to
supply
the
power
to
the
partly
to
the
grid.
The
layout
of
the
micro
irrigation
system
consisting
of
number
of
subunits
will
play
the
key
role
in
optimallyselecting
the
operating
PV
energy.
Irrigation
pumps
should
minimize
water
losses.
It
should
minimize
water
loss
and
power
losses.
So,
this
should
be
without
imposing
significant
additional
head
on
the
irrigation
pumping
system
and
it
should
be
of
low
cost
it
should
be
economical
this
is
our
aim.
So,
to
get
more
detail
about
this
particular
topic,
how
to
integrate
solar
PV
system
with
micro
irrigation
system
please
refer
these
books
these
particular
books
these are useful for your study .
So,
in
this
particular
lecture
we
discussed
about
power
controller ,
we
discussed
about
selection
of
the
pump,
we
discussed
about
how
to
integrate
micro
irrigation
system
there
could
be
different
strategy ,
there
could
be
different
layout
of
the
system.
So,
this
way
and
in
the fourth coming lecture, we have studied several formulae there are several equations.
So,
means
we
will
have
the
practical
experience
and
while
we
will
calculate
those
values
in
the forthcoming lecture that is tutorial 10. So, thank you very much.
