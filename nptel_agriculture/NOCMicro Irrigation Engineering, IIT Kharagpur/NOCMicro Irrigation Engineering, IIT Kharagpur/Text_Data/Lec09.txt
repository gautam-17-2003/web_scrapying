Demonstration of Agro Meteor ological Instruments
Dear
participants,
in
this
lecture
we
will
learn
various
agro-metrological
instruments.
There
are
various
parameters,
which
you
learn
in
estimating
evapotranspiration,
in
determining
evapotranspiration
by
measurement.
So,
in
the
field,
we
will
show
you
these
parameters.
How
to
monitor
various
climatic
parameters,
various
weather
parameters
which
are
dealt
with?
So,
let
us
go
to
the
field
where
we
have
installed
these
gadgets
in
an
agrometeorological
station.
These
gadgets
the
instruments
have
been
installed
and
we
will
demonstrate
you
in
the
field itself.
In
the
agricultural
and
food
engineering
department,
we
have
established
an
agro-metrological
observatory .
The
agrometeorological
observatory
is
of
the
size
of
60
meters
by
40
meters.
Where
various
instruments
are
installed
to
monitor
data
on
rainfall,
maximum
temperature,
minimum
temperature,
wet
bulb
temperature,
dry
bulb
temperature,
evaporation.
We
are
recording
data
on
wind
speed,
we
are
recording
data
on
which
direction
wind is blowing, we are recording data on solar intensity .
We
are
recording
data
on
total
sunshine
hours
and
then
there
are
various
other
data
which
are
important for irrigation purposes, for hydrologic studies so all kinds of data.
Now ,
in
previous
classes
which
we
have
discussed
estimation
of
evapotranspiration
and
where
we
emphasized
the
use
of
these
climatological
data
for
estimation
of
evapotranspiration,
where
you
have
seen
that
maximum
temperature,
minimum
temperature,
average temperature as well as solar intensity , total sunshine hours, relative humidity .These
data
were
used
to
estimate
evapotranspiration.
So,
evapotranspiration
studies
or
for
any
irrigation
planning
is
studies
such
data
are
very
important.
And
now
we
will
be
discussing
each
of
these
units
in
detail.
This
is
a
Stevenson’ s
screen.
Stevenson’ s
screen
is
made
up
of
wooden
material.
And
in
Stevenson’ s
screen,
what
we
see
here
are
the
battens
and
they
are
inclined battens.
So,
that
air
can
easily
go
inside
the
house.
Now
in
the
Stevenson’ s
screen,
we
house
a
dry
bulb
temperature
thermometer ,
where
we
record
what
is
the
air
temperature?
And
then
another
one
is
a
wet-bulb
thermometer .
So,
wet-bulb
thermometer ,
the
water
from
this
particular
bottle
is
transferring
to
this
muslin
wet
cloth.
So,
that
the
tip
of
the
bulb
of
the
thermometer is kept in this muslin with the wet cloth.
So
that
it
monitors
the
wet-bulb
temperature
of
the
air.
So,
these
two
temperatures,
dry
bulb
as
well
as
wet-bulb
temperature.
This
is
used
to
determine
the
relative
humidity
of
the
air.
Now ,
in
this
particular
device
monitoring
minimum
temperature
and
maximum
temperature
these
two
thermometers
are
also
housed.
Now ,
we
can
see
right
now,
the
minimum
temperature as of yesterday when it was recorded is 19 degrees Celsius.
Whereas,
the
maximum
temperature
in
last
24
hours
means
in
last
these
24
hours
it
was
33
degrees
Celsius.
So,
then
you
know
this
particular
device
also
housed
a
hygrometer
to
monitor
the
relative
humidity
of
the
air.
So,
these
data
are
very
important
in
various
equations,
when
I
was
discussing
evapotranspiration,
these
temperature
data
are
used
to
estimate evapotranspiration.
The
wind
is
another
very
important
parameter
for
estimating
evapotranspiration.
Now ,
wind
causes
the
transport
of
water
vapor
from
the
evaporating
surface
to
a
particular
direction.
So,
when
we
are
interested
to
know
what
is
the
direction
of
the
wind.
So,
this
can
be
measured
by
or
this
can
be
determined
by
using
Wind
Vane.
Now
from
which
direction
wind
is
coming,
suppose there is a vast water body that exists in the nearby field.
So,
the
water
body
will
transport
if
the
wind
is
coming
from
the
water
body
and
it
is
coming.
So,
we
will
have
the
effect
of
a
cooler
environment
in
that
particular
area.
That
will
influencethe
evapotranspiration
or
vaporization
of
the
water
molecules
and
this
will
affect
the
evapotranspiration.
If
it
is
say
the
surrounding
area
where
we
want
to
measure
and
the
direction
of
the
wind
are
having
a
place
where
a
lot
of
you
know
desert
or
without
cropland
exists there.
So,
the
environment
or
the
microclimate
of
that
particular
area
will
be
different
and
it
will
have
a
drier
climate,
and
that
will
that
is
going
to
affect.
So,
the
direction
of
the
wind
is
also
equally
important
when
we
are
estimating
or
when
we
want
to
know
the
influence
of
the
wind
on
the
evaporation
process
or
vaporization
process.
As
I
told
wind
is
one
of
the
important components of metrological data and wind causes the transport of water vapor .
Now
the
amount
of
the
transport
of
water
vapor
will
depend
upon
the
speed
of
the
wind.
So,
wind
speed
is
measured
by
using
an
instrument
called
an
anemometer .
Now
in
the
anemometer ,
there
are
three
cups,
these
three
cups
are
hemispherical.
And
when
a
slight
wind
comes,
this
causes
these
cups
to
rotate
around
their
axis.
So,
the
number
of
revolutions
it
takes
in
a
given
time
is
directly
proportional
to
the
wind
speed.
In
the
previous
class,
I
was
telling
about
the
estimation
of
evapotranspiration
and
particularly
for
determining
the
pan
coefficient.
So,
the
value
of
the
pan
coefficient
depends
on
the
wind
speed
and
relative
humidity
of
the
area.
So,
it
is
one
of
the
important
components,
and
depending
on
the
magnitude
of
the
wind,
the
transport
of
water
it
takes
place,
higher
the
wind
speed
more
will
be
the
transport
of
the
water vapor .
Solar
radiation
and
the
total
daylight
hours
that
are
sunshine
hours
are
another
important
components for evaporation and evapotranspiration or photosynthesis activity of the plant.
So,
how
many
hours
in
a
particular
day
in
12
hours
period,
how
many
hours
sunshine
exists,
can
be
measured
by
Campbell
Stokes
Pyranometer .
So,
here
what
we
see
there
is
a
ball
which
is
made
up
of
a
glass
of
7.5
centimeters
in
diameter .
And
then
below
this
ball,
there
is
a
curved
surface
on
a
frame
on
which
this
particular
chart
is
placed.
Now ,
this
particular
chart
is placed.And
this
chart
practically
what
happened
depending
on
the
movement
or
position
of
the
sun,
this
you
know
when
it
is
rotating
when
the
movement
takes
place
that
it
is
because
it
focuses
in
such
a
way
that
it
burns
the
paper .
So,
a
number
of
hours
total
sunlight
daylight
hours
are
there,
that
is
you
know
coming
here
as
a
burnt
part
and
this
value
is
used
in
many
calculations
of
evapotranspiration
or
also
this
value
is
used
for
finding
out
the
evaporation
from
a
water
body ,
evaporation
from
the
soil
surface.
So,
this
gives
information
that
how
many number of hours on a particular day the sunlight exists.
Measurement
of
rainfall
by
using
a
rain
gauge
is
another
piece
of
equipment
in
any
agro-meteorological
observatory .
And
in
all
the
agro-metrological
observatory
Simon’ s
type
of
rain
gauge
that
is
a
non-recording
type
of
rain
gauge
is
used.
Now ,
this
rain
gauge
is
a
standard
size
of
the
funnel
and
it
has
a
127-millimeter
diameter
of
the
funnel.
So,
whatever
rain is captured by a non-recording type of rain gauge is collected in this funnel.
Then
it
comes
so
this
is
the
bottom
part
of
the
funnel
then
it
is
collected
in
a
cylinder .
Now ,
the
amount
of
water
that
is
collected
in
the
cylinder
is
measured
by
using
a
standard
measuring
cylinder .
And
this
measuring
cylinder
has
got
200-centimeter
square
area
and
volume
or
depth
of
water
we
can
see
the
depth
of
water
that
whatever
it
has
occurred
in
24
hours is measured by using this cylinder .
So,
here
it
is
a
graduated
here,
the
graduation
scale
is
shown
the
1
to
11
numbers
this
can
be
seen.
Now ,
these
numbers
are
nothing
but
the
depth
of
rainfall
in
centimeters
in
a
particular
place.
Now
it
may
happen
during
the
active
rainy
season
then
one
has
to
take
observation
two
times or three times during the day in 24 hours.
Soil
temperature
is
another
parameter
that
is
used
to
find
out
soil
heat
index
also
how
much
is
the
soil
heat
flux
it
takes
place
and
which
direction
and
at
what
depth
suppose
there
is
soil
moisture
at
a
certain
depth,
this
will
influence
the
soil
temperature.
So,
these
are
placed
at
different
depths
and
this
is
made
inclined
so
that
it
becomes
easier
to
know
that
what
the
temperature
of
the
soil
is.
So,
these
are
kept
15-centimeter ,
30-centimeters
at
depth
or
it
can
go below 30 centimeters also. So, this is a manually recorded soil temperature observation.And
this
is
used
for
many
research
studies,
how
much
is
the
soil
heat
flux
it
takes
place,
which
direction,
whether
the
up
to
what
depth
the
atmospheric
temperature
which
is
influencing
the
temperature
of
the
soil.
So,
it
will
depend
upon
the
porosity
of
the
soil,
it
will
depend
upon
the
compactness
of
the
soil,
it
will
depend
upon
the
bulk
density
of
the
soil
that
is
making
difference
but
the
influence
of
the
moisture
content
influence
of
the
vegetation
that
also makes a dif ference in the value of soil temperature.
These
data
can
be
recorded
manually
and
also
they
can
be
recorded
you
know
by
in
the
digital
form
by
using
a
soil
moisture
sensor .
So,
this
is
a
sensor -based
soil
temperature
monitoring.
So,
there
is
one
sensor
that
is
a
place
that
is
30-centimeter
depth,
in
this
one,
this
is
a
soil
temperature
sensor .
This
sensor
is
basically
for
knowing
the
leaf
temperature.
So,
leaf
temperature,
soil
temperature,
air
temperature,
these
permissions
are
important
for
many
research studies.
Here
we
are
seeing
a
Pan
Evaporimeter .
Pan
Evaporimeter
is
125-centimeter
diameter ,
it
has
a
depth
of
25
centimeters
and
it
is
placed
over
a
wooden
plank
platform
and
is
placed
at
a
certain
height
above
the
land
surface.
So,
that
the
transport
of
air
can
easily
takes
place
and
there is a minimum influence of earth temperature or soil temperature on the pan.
Now ,
the
water
in
the
pan
is
you
know
is
filled
up
to
20
centimeters
and
the
amount
of
water
evaporated
from
the
pan
it
depends
on
the
solar
radiation,
temperature
and
as
we
see
this
is
the
surface,
at
this
surface,
the
temperature
is
just
near
the
surface
is
lesser
as
we
go
higher .
So,
this
makes
a
temperature
gradient.
So,
saturation
vapor
pressure
and
then
here
the
vapor
pressure
of
the
air
at
the
lower
temperature,
higher
temperature,
this
causes
this
vapor
pressure dif ference.
So,
this
vapor
pressure
difference
causes
the
movement
of
water
vapor
in
the
atmosphere.
So,
in
24
hours
whatever
amount
of
water
is
lost
from
the
pan
gives
an
indication
in
the
ceiling
well,
ceiling
well
is
practically
it
is
meant
for
showing
the
what
is
the
amount
of
water
it
is
lost
due
to
evaporation.
So,
we
are
measuring
the
loss
of
water
and
then
refilling
bringing
it
to the original position.Whatever
it
is
their
so
there
is
a
device
where
we
are
filling
in
the
evaporation
pan
and
this
is
practically
one
bucket
in
which
the
water
is
filled.
So,
amount
of
water
which
we
are
filling.
Here,
you
can
see
there
is
graduation
where
graduation
it
is
so
that
the
how
much
amount
of
water
is
being
filled
into
the
pan.
So,
we
can
see
here
0
centimeters
then
1
centimeter ,
2
centimeters. So, that means any amount of water which is lost, that is directly one can know .
So,
this
we
are
every
time
whatever
amount
of
water
it
is
lost,
we
are
refilling.
So,
in
24
hours
these
observations
are
of
all
the
metrological
gauges
it
is
taken
three
times
in
a
day
normally
it
is
three
times
in
a
day.
So,
7:30
am,
8:30
am
as
per
the
IMD
recommendation,
and
2:30
pm.
So,
means
the
pan
evaporation
data
are
taken
at
8:30
am.
So,
the
amount
of
water
lost in the last 24 hours is replenished by filling the tank using this particular bucket.
So,
in
this
bucket
it
is
already
graduated
bucket
and
where
these
graduations,
so
that
how
much
amount
of
water
we
have
filled
into
the
pan.
A
screen
is
placed
over
your
evaporation
pan
to
prevent
the
entry
of
birds
or
any
other
animals.
So,
though
this
screen
influences
the
amount
of
evaporation
so,
we
are
required
to
correct
it.
But
this
is
required
to
keep
above
the
pan.
So,
that
birds
or
others
they
do
not
disturb
and
we
can
get
correct
observation
at
the
end
of
24
hours.
Now ,
the
surrounding
conditions
of
the
pan
also
influenced
the
pan
evaporation.
For
this,
we
are
required
to
know ,
what
is
the
surrounding
conditions
when
the
wind
is
blowing.
So,
from
which
direction
the
wind
is
coming,
and
then
what
is
the
surrounding
where
there
is
a grass or there is some crop is grown in the adjacent area.
So,
at
what
distance
is
this
adjacent
area
this
crop
is
being
grown
or
it
is
all-barren
land.
So,
this
influences
the
value
of
the
evaporation
which
is
taking
place
from
the
pan,
and
accordingly , the pan coef ficient is used to estimate pan evaporation.
We
have
seen
equipment
where
the
data
are
recorded
manually ,
we
have
seen
a
rain
gauge,
we
have
seen
pan
evaporimeter ,
we
have
seen
the
data
which
are
wind
speed,
sunshine
recorder or maximum and minimum temperature.So,
those
data
are
recorded
manually .
In
this
case,
what
we
are
seeing
here
is
automatic
data
are
recorded
for
all
these
parameters
rainfall,
maximum
temperature,
minimum
temperature,
relative
humidity ,
wind
speed
as
well
as
solar
radiation.
So,
all
these
data
are
recorded
by
using
sensors
in
the
digital
mode
data
are
put
up
recorded
in
your
data
logger .
It
can
be
downloaded by connecting and also it can be transmitted to the server .
So,
this
is
the
arrangement
which
we
have.
Now
in
this
one
the
sensors
which
what
I
am
showing
you
here,
we
have
got
a
maximum
temperature,
minimum
temperature
as
well
as
dry-bulb
air
temperature.
Also,
wet
bulb
temperature
and
hygrometer
sensors
are
placed
there
and
this
is
connected
with
the
data
logger .
Then
we
have
a
Pyranometer
and
this
Pyranometer
data is also recorded what is the solar intensity? and then it is coming to the data logger .
On
the
top,
we
see
there
is
a
wind
with
an
anemometer
sensor
that
records
the
direction
of
the
wind
as
well
as
wind
speed.
So,
here
this
is
a
data
logger
and
then
this
data
logger
is
getting
the
power
by
using
this
battery
and
this
battery
is
charged
by
the
solar
panel.
Now ,
the
entire
thing
that
you
are
seeing
here
is
the
wind
speed
and
wind
direction,
this
is
a
particular
type
of
sensor , where it is there and then there is an arrangement for monitoring the rain gauge.
There
is
an
arrangement
for
monitoring
the
air
temperature,
global
radiation,
and
then
there
is
a
GPS
antenna
where
this
particular
station
is
installed.
So,
all
the
data
are
hooked
and
then
is
going
to
a
particular
server
where
these
data
are
saved.
Then
there
is
a
solar
panel
that
provides
power
to
the
system.
Now ,
we
have
in
the
previous
manually
recorded
recording
data.
We
had
a
Simon
type
of
rain
gauge
before,
now
this
is
a
recording
type
of
rain
gauge
which
is
working
like
on
the
principle
of
a
tipping
bucket.
So,
the
water
which
falls
in
this
particular
cylinder
cup
and
this
water
it
comes
to
a
particular
position.
So,
when
the
water
falls
over
there
and
this
will
make
a
particular
count,
once
it
comes
to
this
position.
I
am
not
putting
it
here because the data will be going there.So,
that
will
not
be
correct
to
get
data
because
this
is
going
to
the
main
server .
These
are
tipping
buckets.
So,
one
bucket
is
this
one
and
this
is
another
bucket.
So,
once
it
tipped
and
then
the
number
of
these
tips
it
makes
that
it
countered
and
that
counted
means
equivalent
to
a particular size of the drop which is equivalent to 0.2-millimeter rainfall.
So,
a
number
of
times
it
takes
it
gives
that
how
much
what
is
the
depth
of
rainfall
in
a
given
time,
it
had
been
recorded.
So,
this
type
of
tipping
bucket
rain
gauge
is
a
recording
type
of
rain
gauge
and
then
data
are
recorded.
So,
these
are
giving
more
precise
values
and
correct
values,
and
then
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
instrument,
one
can
from
the
remote
distance, one can know what is the metrological parameter of a particular place.
One
can
know
and
then
according
to
those
data
that
can
be
used
for
irrigation
purpose
that
can
be
used
for
estimating
the
evapotranspiration
or
various
you
know
water
balance
studies
hydrological study that can be used.
So,
in
the
field
laboratory ,
we
have
seen
various
instruments
where
we
saw
temperature
monitoring
instrument,
thermometer ,
which
measures
minimum
temperature,
maximum
temperature,
wet
bulb
temperature,
dry
bulb
temperature,
for
monitoring
wind
speed
and
direction.
We
also
have
seen
sunshine
recorder ,
you
have
seen
rainfall
measuring
gadgets
that
rain gauge recording as well as the non-recording type of rain gauge.
You
have
seen
an
automatic
weather
station.
And
in
a
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
also
demonstrate you L ysimeter .
So,
you
can
refer
some
of
these
books
for
more
detail
about
these
instruments,
and
thank
you
very much.
