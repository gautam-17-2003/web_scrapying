Tutorial 9 - Numerical Examples on Design of Sprinkler  Irrigation System
Welcome,
participants
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
subject.
Lecture
44,
I
have
kept
it
for
Tutorial
9
where
we
are
solving
problems
on
design
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
In
previous
lecture,
we
discussed
numerical
problems
on
sprinkler
irrigation
system
where
we
solved
several
problems
related
to
finding
out
the
capacity
of
the
sprinkler
system.
We
also
found
out,
how
to
find
out
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
in
the
main
pipeline
and
sub
main
pipeline?
We
also
used
different
equations
which
were
involved
in
solving
the
problems
related
to
the
parameters
of
head
loss
due
to
friction
or
even
capacity
of
the
sprinkler
system
and
using
the
data
related
to
irrigation
interval
and
then
the
time
of
operation.
So,
those
things we discussed.
Now ,
having
got
enough
knowledge
on
the
design
part.
We
will
use
our
knowledge
for
the
design
of
a
sprinkler
system
by
taking
a
hypothetical
example.
So,
the
concept
here
covered
is sprinkler irrigation system design.
Now ,
for
a
crop
here
it
is
given
5
hectare
area
that
is
a
sugarcane
crop.
And
the
field
where
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
to
be
installed
and
designed
for
this.
So,
in
the
5
hectare
area,
we
have
given
information
that
it
is
a
sugarcane
crop.
And
this
soil
has
its
texture,
its
property
which
is
silt
loam
soil.
It
has
infiltration
capacity
of
1.25
centimeter
per
hour.
The
soil
has
water
holding
capacity
of
15
centimeter
per
meter
depth
of
the
soil.
Root
zone
depth
of
the
crop
is
1.5
meter .
Daily
consumptive
use
rate
is
6
millimeter
per
day.
Means,
every
day
6
millimeter
of
water
is
used
by
the
crop
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration
requirement.
And
then
the
sprinkler
system,
it
is
a
rotating
head
sprinkler
nozzle
and
there
are
other
data
which
are available.
We
have
decided
that
lateral
should
be
18
meter
spaced
along
the
main.
So,
practically ,
it
is
the
sprinkler
spacing
along
the
main
which
is
18
meter .
And
then,
sprinkler
spacing
alonglateral,
it
is
12
meter .
So,
this
is
the
area
covered
by
one
sprinkler ,
18
meter
by
12
meter .
Then,
the
pump
is
able
to
deliver
pressure
of
2.5
kg
per
square
centimeter .
So,
this
is
the
operating
pressure
which
is
required
for
the
sprinkler
to
operate.
That
is
2.5
kg
per
square
centimeter .
And
then,
there
are
2
nozzles.
It
is
a
twin
nozzle
system.
So,
one
nozzle
that
is
a
range
nozzle
is
having
size
of
5.5563
millimeter .
And
then,
spreader
nozzle
is
3.175
millimeter .
The
pump
which
is
used
to
take
water
from
the
well,
so,
it
has
got
suction
lift
of
20
meter .
The
application
efficiency
of
the
sprinkler
system
is
90
%.
That
is
irrigation
efficiency , we can say and the system operate till 10 hours per day .
So,
these
are
the
data
which
are
available.
The
other
data
here,
it
is
given.
Difference
in
the
highest
point
of
lateral
and
main
from
the
pump
level
is
0.5
meter .
So,
this
is
another
one
data
which
is
available
with
us.
And
then,
the
pressure
variation
from
the
main
to
the
farthest
point of lateral is 2 meter . So, this is the pressure variation.
Rather ,
I
say
it
is
the
elevation
difference
which
means
elevation
of
the
farthest
point
with
respect
to
the
main.
So,
lateral,
when
we
are
placing
it
so,
that
last
sprinkler
which
is
attached
with
the
lateral.
And
then
the
first
sprinkler
which
is
attached
with
the
lateral
which
is
connected
with
the
main.
So,
this
elevation
difference
is
given
as
a
2
meter .
So,
these
data
we
will use while we will solve the problem.
Now ,
these
data
in
the
symbol
form
it
is
given.
That
area
is
5
hectare.
The
water
holding
capacity
which
we
called
as
a
moisture
content
at
field
capacity
is
15
centimeter
per
meter
depth
of
the
soil.
Depth
of
root
zone
of
the
crop
is
1.5
meter .
Application
rate
means
we
need
to
operate
the
sprinkler
below
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil.
That
is
1.25
centimeter .
Mean this is the maximum allowable value. If it goes more than this, it will form run of f.
So,
basic
purpose
of
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system
as
well
as
drip
irrigation
system,
we
are
not
allowing
the
water
when
we
are
applying,
it
should
form
run
off.
So,
it
should
be
always
less
than
the
infiltration
capacity
of
soil.
But,
application
rate
it
should
not
be
that
low
that
the
water
should
fall
and
then
it
will
meet
the
requirement.
It
should
not
be
that
fine
drops.
That
it
does
not
fall,
it
remain
in
the
air.
There
will
be
huge
loss
of
water
in
the
form
of
evaporation.
And
then,
consumptive
use
rate
of
the
crop
is
6
millimeter
per
day.
So,
this
isanother
data
available
to
us.
So,
Step
1,
we
are
given
maximum
application
rate
of
1.25
centimeter
per
hour.
This
is
the
requirement
and
total
water
holding
capacity
of
the
soil
in
the
root
zone
depth
of
1.5
meter .
So,
this
is
22.75
centimeter
will
be
the
water
which
will
be
held
in 1.5 meter .
Now ,
we
are
assuming
here
we
will
allow
up
to
50
%
depletion
then
irrigation
is
given.
So,
when
the
50
%
depletion
it
comes,
irrigation
is
given.
So,
for
50%
depletion,
the
amount
of
water
will
be
means
50%
of
22.5
centimeter
that
is
11.25
centimeter .
Now ,
assuming
the
water
application
rate
as
90%,
then
depth
of
water
to
be
applied
is
12.5
centimeter .
So,
this
will
be
the
depth
of
water
which
need
to
be
applied
for
irrigation
so
that
the
50%
of
depletion
will be maintained.
Now ,
daily
consumptive
use
rate,
we
are
given
6
millimeter
per
day.
So,
one
can
work
out,
what
will
be
the
irrigation
interval?
For
your
information,
we
are
taking
here
50%
depletion
of
22.5
centimeter .
Not
the
value
which
we
have
got
12.5.
Means
exactly
the
water
which
will
be
available,
it
will
be
11.25.
So,
we
are
using
here
11.25
not
12.5.
That
is
the
part
which
I want to emphasize here to get the irrigation interval.
Now ,
in
19
days
irrigation,
we
need
irrigation
interval,
we
need
to
apply
12.5
centimeter
of
water
in
5
hectare
area.
So,
operation
time
of
the
pump
is
given
10
hours
per
day.
This
is
in
the
question
it
is
given.
So,
we
can
work
out
that
what
will
be
the
capacity
of
the
system.
Means,
our
pump
should
deliver
how
much
dischar ge
that
will
be
the
area
multiplied
by
the
depth
of
irrigation
divided
by
the
number
of
days
multiplied
by
the
number
of
hours
operated
in
per
day
and
then
we
have
to
use
appropriate
unit.
So,
5
hectare,
it
is
5
into
10
is
to
power
4.
That
it
becomes
in
square
meter
and
then,
12.5
centimeter
to
be
converted
in
the
meter .
So,
this
will
be
divided
by
100.
Then,
19
days
10
hours,
so,
19
into
10
and
then
it
is
in
second,
we
are
converting.
So,
we
are
multiplying
with
3,600.
Once
we
calculate
this
value,
we
get
0.009
cubic
meter
per
second.
So,
our
pump
should
be
delivering
this
much
rate
of
water
in
19 days period.
Now ,
in
the
question,
Step
4,
we
are
given
the
value
that
the
spacing
of
lateral
along
the
main
or
spacing
of
sprinkler
also
we
can
say
along
the
main
is
18
meter
spacing
of
sprinklers.Along
the
lateral
is
12
meter
this
is
given.
This
information
is
available.
Now ,
we
will
be
using
manufacturers
chart.
So,
when
we
are
purchasing
deciding
the
system
to
be
installed.
So,
normally ,
people
take
the
local
dealer
where
it
is
available.
And
then
from
the
local
dealer ,
such
chart
is
available.
Or,
from
the
manufacturer ,
this
chart
is
available.
And,
we
will
use
this
chart
to
see
that
all
the
data
which
are
given
in
the
field,
those
data
are
brought
to
the
user
for
information.
So,
this
is,
we
will
be
using
the
data.
Let
me
just
show
you
the
chart.
So, this chart is available here.
So,
here
there
are
2
models
and
this
particular
model
we
are
taking.
The
data
it
is
from
the
MS
NOCIL.
This
is
the
company
means
which
I
used
in
my
area
for
using
this
sprinkler
system.
So,
I
got
the
data
from
the
company .
And
here
we
can
see
in
this
chart,
information
is
available.
What
is
the
nozzle
size?
And
then,
what
are
the
operating
pressure
in
this
chart?
Then,
what
is
the
diameter
of
spray
and
then
dischar ge?
And
then,
depending
on
the
particular
type
of
arrangement,
system
we
are
using
it.
Means,
layout
we
are
using
it.
So,
in
the
problem,
we
are
given
that
we
have
a
range
nozzle
of
5.5563
millimeter .
Its
spreader
nozzle
is
3.175
millimeter
and
operating
pressure
is
given
as
2.5
kg
per
square
centimeter .
So,
this is matching with the required data.
Means,
the
sprinkler
will
require
2.5
kg
per
square
centimeter
to
deliver
the
dischar ge.
So,
for
this,
2.47
is
closer
to
2.5.
So,
we
are
taking
this
particular
value.
And
then
at
this
dischar ge,
this
particular
model,
it
is
delivering
means
delivering
water
and
which
has
the
circular
pattern
of
water
distribution
so
the
diameter
of
spray
it
is
a
29.9
meter .
And
then,
at
this
pressure,
and
for
this
nozzle,
the
dischar ge,
it
is
delivering
dischar ge
of
0.637
liter
per
second.
And
then
what
we
are
seeing
we
have
been
given
the
spacing
of
sprinkler
along
the
main.
Spacing
of
sprinklers
along
the
main,
it
is
18
meter .
Along
the
lateral,
it
is
12
meter .
So,
this
will
be
delivering
water
at
the
rate
of
this
1.1
centimeter
per
hour.
So,
this
is
another
data
which we are getting.
So,
this
is
the
manufacturer ’s
chart
we
are
choosing
as
per
the
requirement.
So,
information
means
we
have
been
given
that
it
should
be
less
than
1.25
centimeter
per
hour.
So,
this
is
less
than
1.25
centimeter .
Now ,
it
is
not
too
less.
So,
this
is
1.1
which
is
matching
with
our
requirement.
So,
these
are
the
data
means,
we
have
taken
the
operating
pressure
as
1.25
fromthe
chart.
We
are
getting
the
application
which
is
less
than
the
maximum
allowable
application
rate.
So,
this
is
less
than
this.
And
then,
diameter
of
coverage
about
30
meter
dischar ge
of
the
nozzle.
Just
now
I
told
you
that
0.637
liter
per
second
which
is
nothing
but
0.637
into
10
is
to
power
minus
3
cubic
meter
per
second.
So,
this
data
we
have
obtained
from the chart.
Like
this,
we
can
use
other
data
which
are
more
appropriate
when
we
will
work
out
the
problem.
For
this
problem
I
am
taking
maybe
we
have
got
another
set
of
conditions.
So,
we
will
take
that
chart
and
use
it.
I
am
giving
here
example
for
nozzle.
There
could
be
you
know
there
are
several
companies
in
the
country .
More
than
100
companies
now
on
the
area
in
the
area
of
micro
irrigation
they
are
operating.
So,
they
have
got
their
own
chart.
Those
who
are
manufacturing
sprinkler
irrigation
system
we
can
get
similar
data
from
them
also.
So,
that
was
for
HP
model,
this
is
for
LP
model.
So,
like
this,
there
can
be
some
other
information
so
we can get the data.
Now ,
we
had
the
system
capacity .
We
calculated
0.009
cubic
meter
per
second.
And
just
now
which
we
have
got
that
a
sprinkler
is
delivering
0.637
liter
per
second.
So,
from
this,
we
can
see
that
how
many
number
of
sprinkler
that
can
be
operated
from
that
system
capacity .
So,
what
we
find,
it
is
the
14.12
or
which
is
equivalent
to
14
sprinklers.
So,
14
sprinklers
can
be
operated from the required system capacity with which is estimated.
So,
these
14
laterals,
it
can
be
laid.
This
is
one
of
the
pattern
which
I
am
suggesting.
There
are
2
laterals
and
in
each
lateral
we
are
putting
7
number
of
sprinklers.
So,
this
way
we
will
get
what
will
be
the
length
of
the
pipeline?
So,
if
I
put
means
it
is
given
in
the
question
that
sprinklers
are
spaced
12
meter
and
18
meter
apart.
So,
means,
they
are
spaced
12
meter
and
on
each
2
lateral
lines,
they
are
18
meter
apart.
So,
there
are
7
sprinklers
and
then,
each
sprinkler
has
got
spacing
of
12
meter .
So,
the
length
of
pipeline
is
84
meter .
12
into
7
is
84
meter .
And
to
operate
the
sprinkler
system,
it
requires
a
pressure
of
2.4
kg
per
square
centimeter .
Now ,
2.47
kg
per
square
centimeter ,
here,
it
is
equivalent
to
24.7.
This
is
a
24.7
meter . So, the total allowable pressure variation as per the guideline, it is 20%.So,
20%
of
2.47
is
0.494
kg
per
square
centimeter
or
4.94
or
I
can
say
20%
of
24.7
is
4.94.
This
is
the
allowable
pressure
variation.
Now ,
this
allowable
pressure
variation,
it
will
accommodate
whatever
the
losses
in
the
pressure
can
take
place.
So,
in
the
question,
it
is
given.
There
is
a
pressure
variation
due
to
elevation,
it
is
2
meter .
This
is
already
given
in
the
question
which
I
told
you.
So,
from
this
4.94
meter ,
2
meter
will
be
used
for
elevation.
So,
remaining
pressure
which
is
allowable
is
only
2.94
meter .
So,
this
2.94
meter
is
will
be
considered
for
estimating
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
Means,
this
will
be
used
for
head
loss
due
to
friction.
Now ,
to
get
the
dischar ge
from
the
lateral,
so
each
lateral
has
got
7
number
of
sprinklers.
So,
7
into
0.637
multiplied
by
10
is
to
power
minus
3.
So,
we
are
getting
4.459
into
10
is
to
power
minus
3
cubic
meter
per
second.
So,
this
is
the
dischar ge
of
a
single
lateral. Means, each lateral will be requiring this much of dischar ge.
Now ,
head
loss
due
to
friction,
it
can
be
estimated
by
Darcy-W eisbach
equation.
It
can
be
estimated
by
Hazen-W illiams
equation.
It
can
be
estimated
by
Scobey
formula.
Here,
we
are
using
Darcy-W eisbach
equation.
So,
Darcy-W eisbach
equation,
when
I
am
talking,
that
head
loss due to friction is given by
𝐻𝑓=𝐾×𝑐×𝐿×𝑄𝑚
𝐷2𝑚+𝑛×𝐹
Where
K
is
a
unit
constant,
c
is
another
constant
in
this
equation
and
then
L
is
the
length
of
the
pipeline
in
meter
and
Q
is
the
dischar ge
from
the
pipeline
in
liter
per
minute.
And,
D
is
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline
in
millimeter
and
F
is
reduction
factor .
Now ,
this
K
is
another
means
this
is
also
another
factor .
And,
this
factor
is
associated
with
the
friction
factor ,
this
capital K. So, this capital K is estimated by using this equation which is given by
𝐾=0.811×𝑓𝑔
Now ,
this
f
is
a
friction
factor .
This
friction
factor ,
f,
it
is
a
function
of
Re
that
is
a
Reynolds
number .
It
is
a
function
of
Re.
So,
it
is
a
function
of
Re
when
I
say,
means
velocity
of
flow
and
means
this
Reynolds
number
it
is
estimated
by
rho
VD
by
mu.
Means
we
should
know ,
what
is
the
viscosity
of
the
fluid?
What
is
the
diameter
through
which
the
pipe
water
will
be
flowing?
And
then
your
velocity
of
flow,
dynamic
viscosity
and
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
So,
this
f
is
you
know
we
will
be
using
appropriate
value
of
f.
One
has
to
compute
it
by
using
the
Moody
diagram
and
another
F
is
the
reduction
factor .
F,
reduction
factor
for
Darcy-W eisbach
equation.
First
of
all,
this
is
a
general
equation
when
these
sprinklers
are
equally
spaced.
So,when
they
are
equally
spaced
and
using
the
Darcy-W eisbach
equation,
we
are
using
this
expression
𝐹= 1𝑚+1+12𝑁+𝑚−1
6𝑁2
where
m
equal
to
2
and
N,
this
is
equal
to
number
of
sprinklers
or
outlet,
this
is
7
and
we
are
substituting
this.
These
were
m
and
N
values
in
this
one
and
finding
out,
what
is
the
value
of
reduction
factor?
So,
for
Darcy-W eisbach
equation
and
for
a
given
number
of
outlet
of
7,
so,
we are getting the reduction factor F as 0.407. Now , we know that
𝐻𝑓=𝐾×𝑐×𝐿×𝑄𝑚
𝐷2𝑚+𝑛×𝐹
So,
here,
Hf
is
the
head
loss
due
to
friction.
We
have
already
computed
0.811f
by
g.
g
is
due
to
gravity
and
f
we
have
taken.
This
is
assumed
or
this
is
available
to
us.
So,
we
are
not
computing
by
using
the
Reynolds
equation
or
from
the
Moody
diagram.
We
are
directly
giving
you
this
value.
One
has
to
find
out
from
the
Moody
diagram.
Means,
we
have
to
estimate
and
get
the
value
of
f.
So,
this
f
is
known
to
us.
That
is
0.04,
then
small
c
using
the
SI
units.
So,
this
is
the
277778
multiplied
by
the
length
of
the
pipeline
84
meter
and
then,
this
is
in
liter
per
minute.
So,
liter
per
minute
when
we
are
talking,
so,
this
m
equal
to
2.
So,
4.459
into
60
divided
by
9.81
D
to
the
power
5.
That
is
2m
plus
n.
2m
equal
to
m
equal
to
2
and
n
equal
to
1.
So,
this
is
D
is
to
power
5.
So,
we
are
substituting
the
value
and
then
we
are
bringing D is to the power 5 this side and then put bringing 2.94.
𝐷5=0.811×0.04×277778×84×(4.459×60)2
9.81×2.94×0.407
So,
this
particular
equation
can
be
written
in
this
form.
And,
our
aim
is
to
find
out
what
will
be
the
appropriate
diameter
of
the
lateral
pipeline
to
have
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
of
2.94
meter
having
given
these
data.
So,
we
estimated
and
found
that
this
is
coming
as
59.79
millimeter .
Now ,
in
the
market,
these
pipes
are
available
in
different
diameters.
But,
it
cannot
be
any
odd
number .
They
are
of
standard
size.
So,
it
could
be
1
inch
(means
25
millimeter).
Then,
it
is
given
as
37
millimeter
(one
and
a
half
inch).
Or,
it
is
2
inch
(50
millimeter).
Then,
2.5
inch
(63
millimeter).
So,
this
is
63
millimeter
from
there
we
have
got
and
which
is
available in the market.
Now ,
we
will
estimate
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
in
the
main
pipeline
because
lateral
is
attached
directly
with
the
main
pipeline.
So,
total
length
of
the
main,
it
is
between
you
knowthere
are
2
sprinkler
lines
are
attached
which
are
of
18
meter
spacing.
So,
this
36
meter
is
the
length
of
the
main
pipeline.
Now ,
head
required
to
operate
laterals
which
are
connected
with
the
main
pipeline.
So,
we
have
been
given
H
naught
that
it
is
24.7
from
the
chart
we
are
calculating.
Now ,
head
loss
due
to
friction,
this
already
we
used.
That
is
4.94.
From
there,
we
subtracted
2
meter .
So,
we
got
2.94.
So,
head
loss
due
to
friction
in
the
lateral
pipeline
is
2.94
meter .
This
is
the
head
due
to
elevation.
So,
this
also
we
will
be
accommodating
and
Hr
is
the
height of the riser pipeline.
So,
when
we
are
substituting
this
value,
we
are
getting
the
total
head
required
to
operate
the
lateral
pipe
on
the
main
to
operate
lateral,
so,
30.6
meter .
Now ,
again
you
know
we
are
taking
the
thumb
rule
or
guideline
that
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
or
total
pressure
variation,
it
should
not
exceed
more
than
20%.
So,
we
are
considering
20%
of
30.6.
So,
6.12
meter .
So,
with
6.12
meter
as
a
head
loss
due
to
friction,
we
are
computing
the
diameter
of
the
main
pipeline.
So,
same
way,
the
way
we
did
for
lateral
pipeline,
we
are
getting
the
diameter
of
main
pipeline
which
is
75
millimeter .
So,
69.9
is
estimated
value.
But,
in
the
market,
75
millimeter
pipeline
is
available.
So,
we
are
considering
the
diameter
of
main
pipeline.
For
this purpose is 75 millimeter .
Now ,
total
design
head,
we
will
work
out
in
the
same
manner
that
we
have
been
given
this
your
total
design
head
Ht
equal
to
Hm
plus
Hfl
plus
Hj
plus
Hs.
What
is
Hj?
That
is
the
difference
in
the
highest
point
of
the
lateral
and
from
pump
is
0.5
meter .
This
information
is
already
available
in
the
question.
We
have
been
also
given
suction
lift
of
20
meter .
So,
we
are
substituting
the
values,
we
have
already
got
head
required
at
the
main
to
operate
later
is
30.6.
Head
loss
due
to
friction
of
the
main
pipeline
is
6.12
meter .
0.5
meter
is
Hj
and
Hs
is
this.
So,
total
head
is
57.22
meter .
Now ,
the
pump
has
to
deliver
0.0009
cubic
meter
per
second
of
water against the head of 57.22. So, we can work out the horsepower .
The
pump
is
directly
coupled
with
the
motor .
It
is
directly
coupled
with
the
prime
mover .
So,
it
is
the
only
pump
efficiency
we
are
considering.
So,
let
us
say
that
the
pump
efficiency
is
60%. So, the power requirement in kilowatt can be given by
𝑝𝑢𝑚𝑝 (𝑘𝑊)=9.8×𝑄×𝐻𝑡𝐸𝑝This
is
small
Ht.
So,
this
is
same
Ht
we
are
using
here
and
this
is
the
pump
efficiency .
So,
we
substitute
the
value,
we
are
getting
8.41
kilowatt
is
required
which
is
equivalent
in
terms
of
horsepower
of
the
pump
which
is
equivalent
to
11.27.
8.41
divided
by
0.746.
So,
11.27
horsepower of the pump is required to operate the system.
So,
now,
the,
we
have
worked
out
the
all
these
components.
So,
these
values
are
that
we
have
been
given
the
sprinkler
nozzle.
So,
this
already
we
know .
We
estimated
number
of
sprinklers
can
be
operated
14
and
total
length
of
the
lateral
pipeline,
84
into
2.
That
is
168
meter .
And
then
the
diameter
of
lateral
pipeline
is
63
millimeter .
Length
of
main
pipeline
is
36
meter
which is of 75 millimeter diameter and the pump size is 1 1.27.
So,
we
worked
out
one
example.
It
can
be
another
condition
and
that
will
the
length
of
the
pipeline
and
then
horsepower
requirement
that
can
be
used.
Having
given
such
information
for
any
study
area
one
can
work
out
exactly
all
the
requirement
of
the
distribution
network
and
as
well
as
horse
power
requirement
of
the
pump
can
be
estimated
for
given
information
on
soil,
for
given
information
on
the
crop
that
how
much
is
the
water
consumptive
used
rate
is
there.
What
is
the
type
of
soil?
And
then,
all
other
information
which
I
explained
here
if
it
is
available,
one
can
calculate
the
horsepower
requirement.
And
then,
system
can
be
laid
in
the field.
So, for more problems and your practice, you can refer these books.
So,
let
us
summarize
that
yes
we
worked
out
sprinkler
irrigation
system
design
numerical
problem
and
this
has
given
you
the
knowledge
and
then,
for
practice,
you
can
use
some
other
problems
of
similar
nature.
In
the
forthcoming
class,
we
will
discuss
about
having
got
the
design
data,
how
to
make
the
layout?
How
to
install
the
system?
And
then,
what
are
the
operation
and
maintenance
to
be
done?
So,
in
forthcoming
class,
we
will
discuss
on
this
part.
Thank you very much.
