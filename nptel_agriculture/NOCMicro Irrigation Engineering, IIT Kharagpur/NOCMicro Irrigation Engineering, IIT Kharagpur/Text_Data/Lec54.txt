Lectur e - 54 
Automation of Micr o Irrigation System (Part â€“ 4)
Hello
participants,
I
welcome
you
to
the
lecture
54
is
on
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system
part
4.
In
previous
3
lectures
we
discussed
about
different
components,
we
discussed
about
the
networking
system,
we
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
the
topology ,
different
types
of
sensor
network
and
then
different
programs.
Now ,
here
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
prototype
development
and
what
are
the
different
types
of
components
which
are
involved
in
the
prototype
development
of
the
wireless
sensor
network,
when we are using with or without internet operated micro irrigation system automation.
So,
as
I
told
you
that
in
the
previous
lecture,
we
discussed
about
why
to
automate
micro
irrigation
system?
What
is
the
role
of
ICT
and
IoT
in
micro
irrigation
automation?
Types
of
micro
irrigation
automation
and
then
parameters
which
are
considered
for
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system,
which
are
the
different
components
which
deal
with
the
automation
of
micro
irrigation
systems,
sensors,
controller ,
and
actuators.
And
in
the
previous
lecture
53,
we
discussed
about
the
network
wireless,
wired
or
hybrid
for
data
communication.
We
also
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
programs
with
database
graphical
user
interface
and
then associated software dealing with this.
Here
we
are
talking
about
the
prototype
system
development.
So,
why
we
should
have
the
prototype,
automate
prototype
system
development,
what
is
the
main
goal
of
the
prototype
development?
So,
our
aim
is
for
automation
of
irrigation
system,
if
you
see
that
it
is
for
reducing
the
human
involvement
or
minimizing
the
human
or
without
human
involvement,
reducing the wastage of main thing because we are talking about micro irrigation.
So,
our
aim
is
to
reduce
loss
or
wastage
of
water
and
fertilizer
and
ultimately
it
should
increase
the
crop
yield.
Our
aim
is
to
get
real
time
data,
then
it
should
be
of
low
cost
that
is
the
one
of
the
challenge
that
should
involve
the
low
cost,
there
should
be
low
powerconsumption,
there
should
be
low
maintenance,
and
it
should
be
readily
available
to
use.
Then it can operate using internet or it can operate without having the internet facility .
Particularly
such
systems
are
required
but
when
the
area
is
inaccessible
with
net
connectivity ,
so
for
that
purpose
wireless,
without
internet
system
can
also
work.
To
irrigate
and
fertigate
the
plant
instead
of
soil
that
is
the
normal
thing
which
we
do,
we
do
not
give
water
to
the
soil
but
we
give
water
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crops.
Similarly ,
for
the
growth
of
the
plant
we
supply
fertilizer
or
nutrients.
To
bring
more
land
area
under
cultivation,
where
water
is
limited
so
this
is
another
priority
of
using
micro
irrigation
system
which we started in the beginning also and automation is also meant for doing the systems.
The
prototype
soft
component
involvements
are
internet,
Arduino
IDE
and
then
web
server ,
database,
and
graphical
user
interface.
So,
internet
it
said
that
it
is
used
for
communication
or
making
connection
or
connectivity ,
that
is
the
prerequisite
for
IoT
based
application
and
it
is
for
the
transmitting
the
data,
it
is
used
for
receiving
the
data,
and
which
is
in
as
well
as
the
command.
Arduino
IDE
that
is
Arduino
Integrated
Development
Environment
is
a
cross
platform
application.
It
is
used
to
write
or
upload
program
to
Arduino
board.
So,
any
instruction
any
data
reading
that
can
be
uploaded
in
the
Arduino
board.
Web
server
and
database,
so
purpose
of
using
the
web
server
is
to
get
or
collect
the
data,
stored
the
data,
and
also
transmits
data.
So,
it
act
as
intermediate,
it
is
the
intermediate
between
logic
and
action.
So,
PHP
web
server
or
MySQL
database
this
is
the
example
that
it
can
be
these
are
the
things
and
GUI
that
is
the
Graphical
User
Interface
displays
the
objects
and
convey
information
and
represent
actions
that can be taken by the user .
Now
hardware
components
or
prototype
development
when
we
think
of
or
when
we
are
developing,
so
the
Arduino
Uno
mega,
Arduino
so
this
is
Arduino
Uno
mega,
this
means
Atmega2560,
ATmega328P
are
the
primary
controller
and
the
Arduino
Uno
R3
and
mega
are
the
open
source
microcontroller
platform.
It
is
used
to
collaborate,
send
instruction,
and
receive
input
from
the
DH22,
motor
and
relay
etcetera.
So,
practically
it
is
receiving
information or collaborating information and it is also sending instruction.DHT
11
that
is
the
humidity
and
temperature
sensor ,
it
is
used
for
recording
the
atmospheric
temperature
data,
relative
humidity
data,
and
the
data
are
in
the
analog
signal,
the
range
of
operation
is
3.3
volt
to
5.5
volt.
So,
this
is
what
you
see
here,
this
is
the
data
which
is
coming
and then the information which is coming so this is the device which is the DHT  sensor .
Capacitive
soil
moisture
sensor ,
this
is
the
device
which
is
being
shown
so
practically
what
it
does
it
record
the
sensor
value
when
probe
is
exposed
to
the
air
the
value
1
and
this
is
the
boundary
value
of
dry
soil
when
0%
RH
that
this
reflects
the
humidity .
So,
the
temperatures
as
well
as
humidity
these
data
are
collected
and
this
is
humidity
of
the
moisture
content
of
the
soil,
humidity
of
the
soil
it
is
being
used
so
it
could
be
the
value
is
given
between
0
and
1
and
in between these two.
So,
record
sensor
value
when
the
probe
is
exposed
to
the
water
as
when
we
say
the
value
is
2
mean
humidity
or
moisture
content
of
the
soil
is
100%.
DS3231
this
module
this
is
the
thing,
so
this
module
preserve
the
time
even
if
the
microcontroller
power
it
has
lost
the
power .
It
has
an
inbuilt
battery
system,
so
because
it
has
inbuilt
battery
system,
the
microcontroller
and
it
will collect the data and then it will give you at what time the data has been collected.
This
is
another
hardware
component
which
is
LoRa
Ra-02
SX1278
this
is
the
device
which
you
see
here
LoRa
as
this
part
is
given.
Now ,
this
communication
module
transfer
data
from
field
module
to
remote
module
and
command
from
the
remote
module
to
irrigation
pump.
So,
this
is
the
purpose
of
having
this
particular
communication
module
and
this
is
LoRa
series
Ra- 02 spread spectrum wireless module.
It
is
a
wireless
transmission
module,
based
on
this
wireless
trans-receiver ,
trans-receiver
means
it
is
transmitting
as
well
as
receiving
data.
It
adopts
advanced
LoRa
spread
spectrum
technology
with
the
communication
distance
of
10,000
meter
or
10
kilometre.
So,
this
is
the
special
feature
as
compared
to
other
communication
thing
that
it
is
able
to
capture
the
information from 10 kilometer distance.The
another
node
is,
the
Ai
Thinker
node
MCU
this
is
the
specification,
so
this
module
acts
as
a
Wi-Fi
hotspot,
web
server
for
offline
mode,
when
I
was
telling
you
that
it
can
work
on
the
online
as
well
as
offline.
So,
this
is
when
no
internet
is
there
so
this
particular
device
is
kept
to
work
during
when
Wi-Fi
connectivity
is
not
there
to
be
Wi-Fi
connectivity
be
the
hotspot
this
will
make
the
connection.
So,
Wi-Fi
connections
interface
for
online
mode.
It
includes
firmware
that
runs
on
this,
in
this
particular
series
Wi-Fi
SoC
and
the
hardware
which is based on ESP  12 modules.
The
other
hardware
component
involves
here
is
micro
SD
card
module;
this
module
is
a
simple
solution
for
transferring
data
to
and
from
a
standard
micro
SD
card.
So,
micro
SD
card
reader
module
has
an
SPI
interface
that
is
a
controller
interface,
which
is
compatible
with
any
micro
SD
card
it
uses
5
or
3.3
volt
power
supply
so,
this
is
the
feature.
Practically ,
it
stores
the data when it is being collected and also it is working like it has an SPI interface unit.
So,
another
part
here
is
1.3
inch,
OLED
display
module,
this
is
1.3
inch
12C
OLED
display
is
an
OLED
monochrome
128
by
64
dot
matrix
display
module
with
I2C
interface
or
controller
interface.
It
is
compatible
with
any
3.3
volt
to
5
volt
microcontroller
such
as
Arduino.
So,
this
is for OLED display unit where it will be displaying the value.
The
other
one
is
channel
relay
generic
5
volt
10A
1
channel
relay ,
so
this
acts
as
an
electromagnetic
actuator .
Relay
act
as
a
switch
where
output
connection
will
be
determined
by
input
data
line,
so
this
is
what
we
see
here.
Because
Arduino
board
have
a
5
volt
DC
output
pin,
it
cannot
handle
irrigation
pipe
line
of
240
volt
AC
line.
So,
this
purpose,
this
particular channel relay is used.
This
relay
solves
this
problem
by
acting
as
electromagnetic
switch
and
relay
is
used
to
operate
the
motor .
So,
this
device
is
very
important
for
interfacing
with
the
240
volt
AC
line
with
the
particular
Arduino
board
when
it
is
fitted.
Water
pump
it
controls
the
flow
of
fluid
or
liquid
and
supplied
water
for
micro
irrigation
and
creates
adequate
pressure
that
is
the
job
of
the
pump
when
we
are
giving
water
that
all
the
pointsâ€™
water
should
reach
and
then
deliver
adequate pressure to operate dif ferent emission devices.Now ,
the
components
which
we
are
using
in
our
system,
when
we
are
making
it
so
there
are
a
different
component
which
has
been
used,
there
justification
why
we
have
used
these
components.
So,
ARDUINO
UNO
and
mega
is
being
used
as
a
microcontroller
board,
because
it
is
readily
available,
it
is
low
in
cost,
it
requires
low
energy
consumption,
and
it
has
got
a
256
kilobyte
flash
memory
and
8
KB
random
access
memory
and
then
this
is
EEPROM
of 4 KB.
And
then
it
is
open
source,
this
is
another
advantage
it
is
open
source
no
permission
is
needed.
And
this
particular
board
is
with
the
integrated
development
environment,
it
is
a
free
and
easy
to
operate.
Microcontroller
program
is
easy
to
learn
debug
and
large
online
community
to
help
out.
It
is
compatible
with
the
sensors
peripheral
hardware
and
also
cheap
and
available
in
large
variety .
Sensors
and
peripheral
libraries
are
free
open
source
and
readily available so this is the features of ARDUINO UNO IDE.
And
then
another
device
which
we
are
using
for
communication
module
is
a
LoRa
Ra-02
SX1278
this
is
a
long
range
about
to
10
kilometre
in
perfect
condition
around
1
kilometre
where
there
is
no
line
of
sight.
This
particular
range
is
sufficient
for
our
Indian
condition
to
transmit
and
receive
data
from
field
to
end
user.
It
requires
low
power
or
low
energy
consumption
that
it
is
a
low
cost
compared
to
other
communication
module
and
it
operates
in
licensed
free
bandwidth
that
is
from
865
to
867
megahertz
this
is
the
range
available
for
our
India
and
very
basic
encryption
is
available
at
software
level
programmer
can
assign
a
node
address
as
well
as
an
encryption
that
is
a
security
feature
for
the
nodes.
And
then
it
is
compatible with the Arduino and corresponding libraries are also available.
The
other
component
which
we
will
be
using
in
our
prototype
development,
so
this
hardware
is
Ai
Thinker
Node
MCU,
this
is
also
for
communication.
It
act
as
an
web
server
for
offline
mode,
act
as
a
Wi-Fi
hotspot
means
for
offline
mode
of
operation
and
it
connect
to
any
Wi-Fi
network
be
the
internet
connectivity ,
easy
to
program,
it
is
open
source
library ,
very
cheap
and
it
requires
low
power ,
it
is
reliable,
it
has
RAM
of
128
kilobyte
and
4
megabyte
ROM
and
provided
with
the
larger
memory
and
very
important
while
deploying
web
server
to
node
MCU.
The
on-board
USB
to
serial
chip
to
easily
program
and
upload
code
from
the
ArduinoIDE.
Easy
access
to
the
general
purpose
input
output
GPIO
pins
for
easy
prototyping.
So,
these are the essentially useful features to select this particular communication module.
There
are
from
electromagnetic
actuator
that
is
your
channel
relay
and
so
we
have
selected
generic
5V
10A
1
channel
relay ,
it
has
got
back
EMF
protection.
The
other
features
why
we
are
selecting
so,
it
works
with
the
logic
level
signals
from
3.3
volt
to
5
volt
devices.
AC
control
voltage
250
volt,
maximum
10
ampere,
and
DC
control
up
to
30
volt,
maximum
10
ampere. So, it is of low cost that there another advantage.
The
real
time
clock
module,
so
it
maintains
the
clock
even
at
the
time
of
power
failure.
It
will
retain
the
time
and
it
has
inbuilt
battery ,
Arduino
has
one
internal
clock,
but
it
cannot
retain
the
time
in
case
of
power
failure
so
this
is
a
feature
of
this
particular .
So,
it
is
a
compatible
with Arduino, open source libraries are available low power requirement and it is of low cost.
Now ,
I
am
coming
to
the
hardware
which
we
are
putting
in
the
field.
So,
this
is
a
field
module
and
the
field
module
here
what
you
see
here,
this
is
the
sensor
means
this
is
a
capacitive
soil
moisture
sensor ,
which
is
placed
in
the
field
means
put
up
in
the
soil
which
will
capture
the
data
means
soil
moisture
content.
Then,
there
is
a
real
time
clock
this
already
I
have
told
why
this
particular
clock
it
is
using.
And
then
there
is
a
Arduino
mega
controller ,
so
already
this
particular
feature
we
have
discussed
about
the
Arduino
2560
which
are
connect
means
these
sensors,
as
well
as
soil
moisture
sensor ,
temperature,
and
humidity
sensor
these
are
connected
and
then
there
is
a
communication
module
means
the
data
which
are
being
captured
is
being
displayed by OLED display and then it will transmit the data to the other Arduino.
So,
the
description
here
that
Arduino
mega
controller
gets
soil
moisture
data
from
the
soil
moisture
sensor ,
it
gets
the
atmospheric,
there
could
be
many
other
sensors
it
can
be
tagged
with
this
device
which
are
required
in
the
automated
irrigation
system
though
here
just
I
am
showing
you
only
the
temperature
and
humidity
there
could
be
many
other
sensor
that
can
be
connected
as
per
the
requirement.
It
sanitize
the
incoming
sensor
data
and
display
this
via
OLED.
At
predefined
interval
Arduino
mega
send
this
data
to
receiver
module
which
is
around
200
meter
from
the
field
for
further
processing
via
this
LoRa
Ra-02
module
wirelessly . So, this is the advantage of having the LoRa.Now
this
is
a
receiver
module
means
data
which
has
been
captured
from
the
field
is
being
received
and
this
model.
So,
this
is
your
node
MCU
communication
module
which
has
come
from
the
field
so
it
is
being
received
and
then
this
is
here
the
OLED
display
unit.
So,
these
data
are
being
once
received,
so
in
this
Arduino
IDE
in
this
controller ,
these
are
being
captured.
It
is
being
stored
in
the
micro
SD
card
and
then
it
is
displayed.
So,
let
me
just
explain
you
in
more
detail
about
this
particular
arrangement
of
the
different
devices
which
are
being
received
from
the
field
Arduino
mega
microcontroller
receive
sensor
data
via
LoRa
Ra-02
module
wirelessly .
Now ,
Arduino
mega
stored
the
data,
it
store
data
at
micro
SD
and
display
the
relevant
information
in
both
OLED.
So,
this
is
the
thing
this
being
displayed
after
the data is being received.
Depending
on
the
type
of
requirement,
it
can
work
online
as
well
as
offline
mode.
Online
mode
when
the
internet
connectivity
is
there
and
offline
mode
when
no
internet
connectivity
exists.
Online
mode,
the
MCU
connect
to
the
internet
via
Wi-Fi
network
and
send
data
to
the
web
server
and
retrieve
the
user
input
data
from
the
server .
Then
transfer
this
command
to
the
Arduino mega.
So,
based
on
the
command
Arduino
send
command
to
the
field
water
pump
via
LoRa
through
again
the
LoRa
is
communication
information
to
the
actuator
or
relay .
In
offline
mode,
when
data
are
not
available
means
your
network
is
not
available
then
node
MCU
acts
as
a
web
server
and
Wi-Fi
hotspot
will
be
the
other
card
which
can
have
connection
that
is
hotspot
network created user has to connect this Wi-Fi network from their mobile devices.
So,
a
mobiles,
cell
phone
can
be
used
and
this
app
will
request
the
relevant
information
to
the
web
server
that
is
maintained
by
the
node
MCU
and
user
can
give
command
to
start
or
stop
the
pump
from
the
app,
an
app
will
be
loaded
and
this
will
function
for
stopping
or
putting
on
the
pump,
opening
the
pump.
So,
this
is
a
third
part,
third
part
means
the
data
which
has
been
received
that
has
been
processed
and
depending
on
the
status
of
the
field,
then
information
is
coming
to
here,
the
data
are
coming
means
it
has
come
to
the
communication
from
the
LoRa
communication
module
and
it
is
received
here
and
then
it
is
brought
to
the
Arduino
board
then
a
program
is
written
over
here
and
then
it
will
communicate
information
and
then
that
will be switching on and switching of f the pump.So,
Arduino
mega
microcontroller
receives
command
by
LoRa
Ra-02
module
wirelessly ,
Arduino
mega
sends
signal
to
the
relay
depending
on
the
command
it
has
received.
So,
OLED
screen
display
relevant
information
and
the
state
of
the
water
pump
whether
it
has
given
how
much
volume
of
water
to
give,
how
much
time
it
should
be
operated
that
can
be
taken
care.
So,
relay
in
turn
switch
on
or
switch
off
the
water
pump
according
to
the
command.
Now
command
it
can
be
timer
based,
it
can
be
volume
based,
and
it
could
be
soil
moisture
based.
So
another
sensor
will
be
soil
moisture
sensor ,
which
we
are
taking
data
that
there
can
be
a
threshold
value
that
this
is
the
threshold
value,
the
water ,
moisture
content
it
has
gone
below
a
threshold
value.
So,
it
will
switch
on
the
pump
then
the
soil
moisture
data
which
will
be
getting
updated
means
it
will
be
increasing
the
moisture
content
in
the
soil.
So
there
will
be
again
threshold
value
that
is
soil
value
which
field
capacity
of
the
soil,
then
we
will
switch
off
the
pump.
So,
this
information
it
will
be
coming
to
the
LoRa
and
then
Arduino
will
be
doing the relay part of this thing.
So,
this
has
been
explained
by
using
this
particular
diagram
so
what
we
see
this
is
farm
land
where
our
sensors
are
deployed,
and
these
sensors
are
from
the
farm
land
there
is
a
field
module
where
the
sensors
are
deployed
the
sensor
could
be
a
solar
radiation
or
it
could
be
a
temperature
sensor
about
the
weather
or
it
can
be
soil
moisture
sensor
or
combination
of
several sensors.
Then
the
field
module
sends
information
data
to
the
remote
receiver
via
LoRa
and
then
it
comes
to
that
is
a
remote
module
this
part
is
a
remote
module
and
then
this
remote
module
sent
information
field
data
to
the
server
via
the
cloud.
So,
this
is
the
cloud
platform
it
goes
to
the
server
and
what
server
does,
the
server
store
the
data
and
wait
for
the
user
request
and
command.
So,
what
happens?
It
is
coming
that
user
request
for
the
information
what
I
needed
it there and then server sent information.
Then
the
user
give
instruction
to
start
or
stop
the
pump
so
this
again,
it
comes
to
this
place
that
your
sent
information
then
again,
it
is
from
the
server
it
will
come
to
the
remote
modulewhich
will
pulled
the
instruction
and
remote
module
send
information,
instruction
to
the
field
actuator .
Accordingly ,
the
field
actuator
will
start
or
stop
the
pump
as
per
the
instructions.
Same
thing
what
I
am
telling,
it
can
be
volume
based,
it
can
be
timer
based,
it
can
be
soil
moisture based, depending on the things which are there.
This
is
about
the
online
things
which
already
I
have
explained
here
in
the
particular
field
module
consists
of
Arduino
soil
moisture
and
there
could
be
many
other
things.
Arduino
collects
soil
moisture
data
and
this
is
means
this
is
also
time
history
of
the
data
at
what
time
the
data
are
being
collected,
there
can
be
some
error
in
the
data
due
to
malfunctioning
of
certain hardware so this should be rectified before it.
And
then
remote
module
consists
of
Arduino
mega,
micro
SD
card,
Lora
module,
node
MCU
and
this
remote
Lora
module
continuously
looking
for
incoming
sensor
data.
After
receiving
the
data,
it
will
sanitize
it
and
from
error
as
data
can
be
corrupted
while
transmission.
It
will
save
the
data
with
the
timestamp
in
micro
SD
card
and
backup
and
at
the
same
time
send
it
to
the node MCU, this node MCU connects to the internet and send this data to the server .
There
are
2
servers
working
in
tandem,
web
server
and
data
base
server ,
database
server
is
store
data,
web
server
wait
for
the
user
request
that
is
the
what
type
of
programming
we
are
giving.
When
the
request
comes
from
the
user
web
server
first
check
and
authorized
request,
user
set
the
threshold
limit
depending
upon
the
real
time
data
command
is
given
to
start
and
stop
the
pump
it
is
first
saved
and
at
the
data
base
server
at
regular
interval
note
the
MCU
connect to the server and looking for water pump status that is saved in the database.
This
command
is
then
sent
back
to
the
field
module
with
relay
and
water
pump.
User
request
real
time
data
using
mobile
app
to
the
web
server ,
so
this
thing
is
happen.
Then
another
thing
is
offline
mode
means
when
internet
connectivity
that
does
not
happen
or
it
is
not
available
things
are
same
and
there
will
be
sensor
data,
field
module,
remote
module
then
sent
field
data
then
what
we
say
there
is
your
node
MCU
act
as
webserver .
Here,
there
is
a
Wi-Fi
hotspot.
So,
Wi-Fi
hotspot
means
from
the
mobile
information
is
available
this
will
be
connected. So, this is connected using a mobile.So,
user
request
for
information
node
MCU
sent
data
and
user
give
instruction
to
start
or
stop
the
pump,
it
comes
from
their
node
MCU
it
sends
data
and
then
a
remote
module
sent
information
to
actuator
by
using
LoRa
and
then
the
pump
will
actuate
say
whether
it
is
to
put
on the motor or it will de-actuate depending on the condition exist.
So,
these
are
the
set
of
things
which
you
have
seen
there
it
is
explained
over
here,
the
data
means,
the
field
module
consists
of
Arduino
same
thing
which
the
Arduino
collects.
So,
whatever
I
have
explained
that
these
are
the
sensors
that
is
soil
moisture
sensor ,
weather
sensor
data,
these
data
should
be
error
free,
it
is
sent
to
the
remote
module
for
further
processing.
The
remote
module
consists
of
Arduino
mega,
micro
SD
card
and
the
LoRa
module, node MCU OLED module.
And
then
the
LoRa
module,
it
looks
for
incoming
sensor
data
after
receiving
data
it
will
sanitize
and
this
data
will
be
made
error
free
while
transmitting
to
the
next
step.
So,
it
will
save
the
data,
it
will
go
to
time
is
time
in
micro
SD
card
and
backup
at
the
same
time
it
sent
to the node MCU.
Node
MCU
has
inbuilt
web
server
but
it
did
not
have
any
kind
of
a
data
server .
So,
database
data
are
in
micro
SD
card
for
future
reference
and
those
data
can
be
used
for
other
program.
And
then
the
node
MCU
has
capability
to
act
as
a
Wi-Fi
hotspot
with
user
defined
Wi-Fi
credentials.
User
can
connect
to
this
Wi-Fi
network
from
their
mobile
device
by
providing
credential.
So,
user
requests
real
time
data
using
mobile
app
to
web
server
that
is
operated
by
MCU.
So,
these
are
the
steps
which
is
same
as
what
is
there
in
the
online
mode
except
the
Wi-Fi
hotspot
for
making
the
internet
connectivity
that
has
been
explained.
Now
these
are
the
user
interface,
what
we
see
here,
how
the
user
means
there
are
things
displayed
to
the
graphical
mode
soil
moisture
sensor
data,
temperature
data,
humidity
data,
temperature
humidity
data,
means
time
history
on
this
particular
day,
at
every
interval
1
minute
or
1
second
depend
upon
the
type
of
refinement
we
need,
such
data
are
can
be
stored
and
then
these
data
can
be
used
and
based
on
this
data,
this
particular
user
interface
here
what
you
see
here,
this
particular
switch is showing as the system is on.Now
if
for
the
given
particular
time
interval
when
it
has
passed,
then
you
put
it
on
that
it
is
partly
manually
operated,
but
this
can
be
programmed
and
then
the
system
can
be
means
pump
can
be
switched
on
or
switched
off.
So,
these
are
the
putting
the
off
when
we
are
doing
it. So, to go deeper about this topic, refer the books as well as internet references.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
discussed
about
the
different
components
of
prototype
development
where
hardware
component
and
software
component
we
discussed.
Then
how
the
hardware
component
they
operate
their
working
system
in
the
online
mode
and
in
offline
mode this has been discussed.
In
the
forthcoming
lecture
we
will
discuss
about
the
economic
analysis
of
micro
irrigation
system part 1. So, thank you very much.
