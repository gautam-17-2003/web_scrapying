Sprinkler  Irrigation System: Layout, Installation, Operation and Maintenance
Hello,
participants.
Now ,
I
am
starting
Lecture
45
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
subject.
This
Lecture
45
is
on
the
topic
Sprinkler
Irrigation
System,
its
layout,
installation,
operation
and
maintenance.
In
Lecture
44,
we
discussed
and
solved
a
design
problem
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
Wherein,
you
got
various
parameters.
Mainly ,
the
size
of
main
pipeline,
size
of
lateral
pipeline,
you
got
information
about
the
horsepower
requirement
of
the
pump.
You
got
number
of
laterals.
Now ,
these
laterals
and
main
pipeline
as
well
as
pump
is
to
be
installed
in
the
field.
So,
it
requires
certain
principles,
certain
guidelines
that
is
to
be
followed.
So,
we
will
discuss
in
this
lecture
about
different
layouts
which
can
be
followed.
What
are
the
different
you
know
installation
procedure
and
the
operation
and
maintenance
of
sprinkler irrigation system?
In
this
part
of
the
lecture,
we
will
learn
different
types
of
possible
layouts
which
normally
occurs
in
the
field.
You
can
see
here
figure
a,
b,
c,
d,
e
and
f.
So,
these
are
the
different
types
of
conditions
which
exists
in
the
field.
So,
in
case
of
a,
it
is
running
with
moderate
and
uniform
slope
where
the
water
supply
is
at
the
center .
And
the
pump
is
attached
with
the
source
of
water
supply .
And
then,
main
pipeline
is
attached
with
the
pump.
Laterals
are
attached
with
the
main
pipeline
on
either
side.
After
the
irrigation
is
completed
laterals
are
moved forward.
There
can
be
different
ways
of
operation.
Here,
you
have
seen
this
is
a
uniform
slope.
Means,
there
is
a
gradient.
But,
there
is
not
very
steep
gradient
kind
of
a
thing.
So,
you
are
seeing
that
the
contour
lines
were
drawn
where
the
elevation
is
given
100,
110,
and
120.
Now ,
it
can
be
another
point
that
odd
number
of
laterals
to
provide
a
required
number
of
operating
sprinklers.
So,
we
will
be
again
you
know
there
is
a
source
of
water .
And,
from
the
source
of
water ,
water
is
brought
to
the
main
pipeline.
And,
from
this
main
pipeline,
lateral
is
attached.And
then,
lateral,
it
will
be
moving
from
this
direction
to
this
direction.
The
arrows
show
the
direction of the movement of lateral.
So,
there
will
be
odd
I
mean
to
say
the
1
3
2
4.
So,
this
kind
of
arrangement
it
will
be
made
to
operate
the
sprinklers.
In
case
of
this
particular
layout,
in
this
layout,
the
main
pipeline
is
laid
in
this
direction.
There
is
a
source
of
water .
The
water
will
be
coming
from
the
source
and
then, it will be given to the main pipeline. And this is also the slope condition it is given.
So,
gravity
pressure
where
the
pressure
gain
approximate
the
frictional
loss.
And
it
allows
running
laterals
downhill.
So,
laterals
are
moved.
So,
direction
of
the
slopes,
it
is
being
shown.
It
is
down
the
slope
it
is
being
maintained.
And
then
whatever
frictional
loss
it
will
take
because
the
gravity
flow
it
takes
place
so
there
will
be
gain
in
the
pressure
and
that
will
be compensated with the frictional loss.
So,
this
is
one
another
arrangement
where
we
see
the
gravity
pressure
where
the
pressure
gain
takes
place.
And
in
this
case,
this
is
the,
another
arrangement
the
laterals
to
be
placed
down
the
slope.
So,
here,
you
can
see
these
are
the
contour
lines
50
to
100.
We
are
seeing
that
these
are
the
contour
lines.
And
then
this
is
the
main
pipeline
and
then
the
water
is
supplied.
This
is
the
main
gravity
pipeline
which
is
being
followed.
And
from
there,
the
water
is
being
supplied
by
using
a
booster
pump
in
the
main
pipeline.
And
then,
laterals
are
connected
and
water
is
applied
to
with
the
help
of
sprinkler
and
movement
is
taking
place.
So,
laterals
to
be
laid downslope to avoid the wide pressure variation caused by running the laterals upslope.
So,
this
kind
of
arrangement
it
is
given
in
case
of
this
arrangements.
There
could
be
different
layouts
depending
on
the
field
conditions.
Now ,
this
is
another
peculiar
conditions
you
can
see.
Here,
the
contour
lines
are
shown
here.
You
can
see
this
is
one
contour .
This
is
the,
another
contour .
So,
it
is
100
meter
contour ,
this
is
90
meter
contour .
But,
it
is
not
this
kind
of
a
thing,
you
know
there
is
a
hill
and
valley .
Means,
in
this
case,
what
is
done?
You
are
seeing
here.
This
is
your
main
pipeline
and
this
is
another
main
pipeline.
And
then
laterals
are
attached
with
the
main
pipelines
in
this
way.
So,
layout
with
2
main,
there
are
2
main
pipeline.
This
is
one
main
pipeline.
This
is
another
main
pipeline
on
the
ridges.
So,
the
2mains
are
put
up
on
the
ridges
and
then
the
laterals
are
accordingly
attached
so
that
the
proper
head loss can be maintained.
Then,
in
this
another
case,
the
layout
with
2
main
pipelines
on
the
sides
of
the
area.
So,
main
pipeline
has
been
placed
at
the
2
sides.
But,
field
situation
is
something
different.
You
can
see
the
contour
and
the
contours
are,
this
is
40
meter
to
100
meter .
It
means,
the
contour
lines
which
has
been
done,
but
this
is
another
kind
of
situation
it
happens.
So,
layout
with
the
2
main
lines
on
the
sides
of
the
area
field
to
avoid
running
lateral
uphill.
So,
instead
of
taking
the
lateral
uphill,
this
can
be
made.
So,
we
may
have
to
spend
more
but
all
the
area
it
can
be
spend more on the length of the main pipeline which is normally lar ge.
But,
we
can
get
water
with
the
lower
pressure
when
we
are
placing
the
main
pipeline
on
the
side
of
the
field
and
then
laterals
are
allowed
to
run
in
this
manner .
So,
this
is
one
lateral.
This
is
another
lateral.
And
then,
the
movement
is
taken.
You
can
see
movement
of
the
lateral
is
taken this direction and this lateral will be moved in this direction.
Then,
this
is
the,
another
arrangement
which
you
have
seen
there.
If
it
is
a
split
lateral
layout,
same
kind
of
your
fields
are
there.
That
can
be
the,
another
way.
In
this
layout,
main
and
sub
mains
are
located
such
that
set
move
lateral
may
operate
on
either
side
of
them.
You
can
see
here,
a,
in
this
case
means,
your
movement
of
the
lateral
may
be
taken
on
either
side
of
them.
So,
it
could
in
case
of
this
particular
figure
or
this
figure
or
in
this
figure,
we
can
see
this
split
lateral
layout
it
is
shown
here.
Means
practically
this
type
of
lateral,
what
happen?
They
minimize
the
frictional
loss
because
we
are
reducing
the
length
of
the
lateral
pipeline.
Split
layout
also
allow
set
move
lateral
to
be
rotated
around
the
main
pipeline.
This
is
the
thing
you
know
we
are
bringing,
moving
the
lateral
in
one
direction
about
this
particular
pipeline.
So,
this
is
the
movement
is
taken.
So,
this
is
the,
another
arrangement.
So,
you
can
see
here.
The
set
move
to
be
rotated
around
the
pipeline.
So,
first,
we
are
operating
here.
Then,
it
we
are
operating here. So, this way the total size of the pump can be reduced.
Labor
requirement
is
also
reduced
by
eliminating
need
to
move
the
lateral
pipes
back
to
starting
from
the
starting
point
c
and
d.
So,
you
can
see
here.
This
is
the
other
means
we
areeliminating
the
need
to
move
the
lateral
pipeline.
That
means
it
has
been
shown
in
case
of
the
layout given in c and d.
Now ,
commonly ,
we
are
using
this
kind
of
a
situation
which
is
also
which
I
explained
there
more
or
less
same
kind
of
it
is
thing.
But,
here,
the
source
of
water
supply
is
the
main
consideration.
Their
slopes
were
the
main
consideration.
So,
if
the
source
of
water
is
stationary ,
let
us
say
here
there
is
a
well
and
then
it
is
located
at
the
center
of
the
field.
This
is
our field.
And,
in
the
field,
there
is
a
source
of
well
located
at
the
field
and
at
the
center .
And
then,
the
pump
will
be
attached
here
and
then,
the
laterals
are
moved
successively
in
the
direction.
So,
this
is
our
main
pipeline
and
lateral
is
attached.
On
this
lateral,
you
are
seeing
these
are
the
sprinklers.
And
these
sprinkler ,
each
sprinkler
it
has
got
its
own
the
diameter
of
coverage.
So,
there
is
certain
overlap.
And
this
overlap
part
already
I
discussed
there.
So,
this
is
the
direction
of
a
movement
of
this
lateral
whereas
the
movement
of
the
direction
of
this
lateral
is
in
the
opposite
direction.
So,
this
kind
of
arrangement
and
then
these
laterals
having
a
specific
spacing.
That
is
Sl
and
this
Sl
will
depend
upon
the
wind
speed
as
well
as
slope
of
the field.
Now ,
there
could
be
some
situation
where
the
stream
or
river
is
flowing.
So,
here
the
entire
setup
will
move.
Means,
pump
will
move
along
with
all
the
assembly
and
then
irrigation
is
being
given.
So,
this
is
what
you
see
here.
Initially
the
pump
was
at
this
position
then
it
is
brought
to
this
position
then
it
is
brought
to
this
position,
Like
this,
you
know
there
are
different positions.
So,
in
a
portable
sprinkler
system,
field
channel
runs
along
the
edge
of
the
farm.
This
could
be
one
system
where
the
stream
is
flowing
by
the
side
of
the
farm.
A
portable
pumping
set,
sprinkler
unit
and
lateral
extending
the
field
are
used
to
draw
water
directly
from
the
channel
and
distribute
it
through
the
sprinkler .
So,
this
is
the
one
arrangement.
So,
initially ,
it
was
stationary , this is the moving case.There
are
some
set
guidelines
when
we
are
installing
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
Those
were
the
arrangement
for
the
movement
of
the
laterals
means
layouts.
Now ,
this
layout
or
installation
is
to
follow
a
specific
guideline.
And
those
guidelines
are
the
main
should
be
laid
up
and
downhill.
Then,
it
should
be
laid
means
lateral
should
be
laid
across
the
slope
or
on
the
contour .
For
multiple
options,
lateral
options
means
when
you
have
got
telescopic
design
you
may
find
theoretically
that
if
farm
is
very
long,
so
first
few
meters,
few
say
if
farm
is
say
we
are
using
200
meter
long
system.
Now ,
in
200
meter ,
first
50
meter ,
the
pipes
size
because
it
has
to
handle
more
water ,
so
pipe
size
will
be
large.
Then,
another
50
meter ,
you
are
getting
another
like
this,
you
know
there
could
be
4
pipe
sizes
diameter
from
the
economic
point
of
view .
But,
what
happen
when
this
is
to
be
done
by
manually?
Then,
too
many
sizes,
it
is
gets
confusion.
So,
it
is
better
that
lateral
pipes
sizes
should
not
be
more
than
2
diameters.
That
is
one
part
from
the
operational
point
of
view .
Water
supplies
as
far
as
possible
if
it
is
a
new
area,
we
are
thinking
of
then
we
should
create
our
own
source
of
water
at
the
center
of
the
farm
so
that
the
irrigation
pipeline
length
can
be
reduced
and
minimized.
Maybe
you
there
is
a
well
you
are
digging.
Tube
well
you
are
wetting
or
you
are
putting
a
large
water
body
of
the
pond.
So,
accordingly ,
one
can
decide.
The
layout
should
facilitate
minimal
lateral
movement
during
crop
season.
So,
this
is
another
part.
One
should
see
that
if
we
keep
on
moving
manually ,
it
is
okay
one
can
take
care.
But,
if
it
is
a
tractor
done
arrangement
or
some
mechanical,
so,
there
is
a
likely
that
is
crop
may
get
damaged.
So,
one
should
see
that
there
is
a
minimum
lateral
movement
should
take
place
and
minimum
difference
in
the
number
of
sprinklers
operating
for
various
setups.
So,
this
is
the
difference
in
the
spacing
between
the
pipeline, so, this should be also taken care that the spacing should not have much dif ference.
Booster ,
if
we
are
not
able
to
create
adequate
pressure
at
the
end
of
the
sprinkler ,
then
in
between
the
pipeline
booster
pump
can
be
used
in
order
to
create
adequate
pressure.
Modify
the
layout
to
apply
water
in
different
rates
and
amounts
when
the
soils
are
of
different
texture.
Means,
suppose,
it
is
a
very
large
area
and
you
may
find
that
soils
have
got
different
textures.
So,
it
will
have
different
infiltration
capacity .
So,
water
application
rate
will
be
different.
So,
there
we
need
to
have
different
types
of
the
sprinkler
system,
nozzle
size,
as
well
as
one
can
modify
the
layout
system.
Mainline
and
sub-main
line
layout
is
key
to
the
lateral
layout.
Theyare
key
to
the
layout.
That
means
we
need
to
see
that
they
are
being
taken
fully
considered
because practically laterals are receiving water from a sub main.
If
the
system
means
it
is
a
large
system
or
it
receives
water
from
the
main
line.
When
the
laterals
run
across
prominent
slope,
mains
and
sub-main
will
normally
run
up
and
down
the
slope.
Here,
this
is
the,
another
part.
So,
those
layouts
which
I
was
showing
you,
this
is
the
one
consideration.
It
has
come
from
there
that
when
laterals
are
to
run
across
the
slope,
then
these are to be put up under uphill or downhill conditions.
Now ,
when
it
is
necessary
to
run
laterals
up
and
downhill,
main
lines
or
sub-main
lines
should
be
located
on
ridges.
This
is
what
in
the
last
part
in
your
this
layout
f,
layout
f
which
I
was
showing
you
that
f
was
especially
that
there
were
2
main
pipeline
which
were
at
the
adjacent
means
at
the
corner
of
the
field
both
the
sides
of
the
field
and
then
laterals
were
attached.
So,
this
is
the
region
that
we
need
to
reduce
the
head
loss
variation
so
that
adequate
pressure is made available.
A
typical
layout
you
are
seeing
here.
This
is
a
typical
layout
where
the
system
is
installed.
Means,
we
are
getting
water
from
the
source.
That
is
a
well
and
then
it
is
being
pumped.
And
if
the
size
of
the
pump
is
very
large
and
requirement
is
less,
then
the
part
of
the
water
it
is
bypassed.
Then,
depending
on
the
quality
of
water ,
this
particular
case
means
it
is
well
water .
So,
from
the
sprinkler
point
of
view ,
normally ,
filter
will
not
be
needed.
But,
if
it
is
a
river
water
or
some
other
source,
a
filter
may
be
gravity
filter
or
the
settling
basin
may
be
required
at
that
point
of
time.
And
then,
there
is
a
main
pipeline.
Here,
you
are
seeing
the
lateral
pipeline.
And
then,
these
laterals
are
attached
at
appropriate
location
spacing.
So,
this
is
the
normal layout which is followed.
And
here,
it
is
a
solid
set
system.
When
I
discussed
you
in
the
different
types
of
the
sprinkler
system.
So,
this
is
a
solid
state
system.
The
system
is
installed
permanently
for
the
whole
season
or
for
whole
year.
And
then,
these
are
operated
simultaneously .
All
the
laterals
can
be
operated
simultaneously
or
part
of
it
can
be.
But,
for
frost
control
or
when
there
is
some
emer gency ,
so,
pump
should
be
able
to
deliver
water
to
all
the
sprinkler
that
kind
of
a
thing.So,
a
typical
installation,
it
can
be
semi-permanent.
It
can
be
portable.
This
already
I
have
told you that when it is a portable when the source of water is dif ferent.
Now ,
the
installation
of
sprinkler
system
components.
The
sprinkler
systems
are
tested
before
installation.
This
means
before
installation,
those
system
component
should
be
tested
and
we
should
have
full
knowledge
that
it
will
work
and
it
will
give
adequate
pressure.
It
will
run
at
this
pressure
so
that
should
have
the
full
knowledge
that
entire
system
is
tested.
Once
the
installation
is
done,
then
after
installation,
again,
it
should
be
tested
whether
it
is
working
perfectly .
The
installation
should
be
carried
out
as
per
the
suggested
guidelines.
So,
when
we
are
talking
about
the
installation
part,
this
installation
consists
of
a
head
control
unit,
making
the
trenches,
fitting
the
pipes
in
the
trenches,
attaching
valves,
main
pipelines,
sub-main
pipeline,
laterals,
and
attaching
sprinkler
head.
All
these
are
the
part
of
the
installation
thing
and
this
should be done looking to the field, one should do the installation.
Let
us
try
to
know
these
installations.
So,
when
we
are
talking
about
the
installation
of
the
head
control
unit
means
head
control
unit
is
basically
a
pump
and
valves
and
then
if
it
is
a
filter
then
we
can.
So,
means
it
requires
a
cemented
platform
because
pump
will
operate
so,
it
will
have
vibration.
So,
it
may.
So,
it
needs
to
be
concrete
platform
and
it
will
depend
upon
what
are
the
components
in
size
and
then,
what
kind
of
arrangement
it
is
there.
In
case
we
need
to
apply
certain
chemicals,
fungicide
in
the
fruit
plantation
in
that
case
chemigation
unit
can
be
also
attached,
and
air
release
valves.
So
valves,
pump,
and
then
the
chemigation
unit,
filter .
Basically ,
this
filter
is
a
gravity
filter
or,
I
am
telling
settling
basin
that
can
be
used.
And
then,
after
putting,
this
should
be
properly
painted
those
parts
so
that
it
should
not
get
corroded.
You
can
see
here
the
trench.
Normally ,
trench
should
be
of
the
size
where
it
will
accommodate
main
pipeline,
sub-main
pipeline
and
if
it
is
a
portable
lateral
pipeline,
so,
this
should
accommodate,
this
should
be
wide
enough.
There
should
be
enough
depth
as
well
as.
So,
normally ,
45
to
70
centimeter
width
and
70
centimeter
or
75
centimeter
of
depth.
These
are
dug
by
using
the
trench
maker
or
by
using
the
excavator .
That
is
a
mechanically
normallyit
is
done.
But,
it
can
be
done
also
manually
if
it
is
a
smaller
area.
The
pipeline,
normally ,
the
pipes
are
HDPE
make
or
PVC.
So,
these
pipes
are
put
up
in
the
trench
and
that
trench
should
be
after
they
are
put
up
it
should
be
seen
that
there
is
no
leakage.
So,
Teflon
tape
is
used
and
then, these trenches are filled with the back fill material.
The
valves,
there
are
quite
a
good
number
of
valves
air
release
valves,
and
flow
control
valve
these
are
installed
and
they
should
be
also
seen.
One
should
see
that
they
are
properly
fitted
and
then,
Teflon
tape
is
used
to
wrap
the
threaded
part
of
these
fittings
so
that
there
is
no
leakage
from
the
system.
The
pipeline,
means
once
whatever
size
of
the
pipeline
which
we
have
designed,
so,
this
will
be
placed
in
the
soil
and
these
pipelines
should
have
the
adequate
capacity
to
withstand
the
pressure.
Once
we
have
placed
the
pipeline
then
we
should
cover
this pipeline with the soil surface or soil cover .
Same
kind
of
a
thing
what
way
I
have
explained
about
the
main
pipeline,
same
thing
is
adapted
for
sub-main
pipeline.
This
could
be
made
up
of
PVC,
HDPE
or
LDPE.
So,
these
are
of
different
sizes.
So,
this
is
also
designed
and
this
should
be
depending
on
the
size
of
the
pipeline
and
thickness
of
the
pipeline
is
decided
and
one
should
follow
the
BIS
standard.
The
quality
pipe
should
be
used.
BIS
instant
pass
pipe
should
be
used
so
that
it
does
not
crack
and
it
should
be
able
to
be
with
stand
the
water
pressure.
It
should
be
with
stand
the
load
which
is
falling on the pipeline.
Then,
installation
of
the
laterals.
So,
laterals
are
also
of
smaller
size
and
they
are
normally
kept
above
the
pipeline
and,
on
these
laterals,
the
riser
pipelines
are
installed.
Installation
of
riser
pipeline,
risers
as
well
as
the
sprinkler
head.
And,
below
the
sprinkler
head,
the
riser
pipeline
it
is
there
which
is
made
up
of
GI.
That
is
a
galvanized
iron.
Normally ,
1
inch
pipeline
that
is
a
25
millimeter
dia.
pipeline
is
used
and
so,
this
is
a
simply
threaded
part
that
can be done very easily .
And,
these
are
the
set
of
tools
and
equipment
which
are
used
when
we
are
installing
the
system.
Of
course,
most
of
the
installation
it
is
done
by
the
dealers
and
supplier .
But,
one
as
a
participant,
we
should
have
knowledge.
What
are
the
different
equipment
which
are
used
for
installation? So, a big list which I have provided so that you can use it for this purpose.Now ,
these
are
some
of
the
fittings.
You
may
find
water
meter ,
is
used
for
finding
out
the
how
much
flow
it
is
taking
place,
pressure
gauge,
elbow
and
how
this
is
the
2
end,
so,
there
is
a
flange,
there
is
a
coupler
and,
on
the
coupler ,
riser
pipeline
is
mounted.
On
the
riser
pipeline
sprinkler
head
has
been
mounted.
This
kind
of
a
flange
which
are
connecting
the
2
pipes
and
in
between
these
2
pipes,
the
sprinkler
is
mounted.
This
is
a
tee
and
this
is
end
cap
to
cut,
terminate
the
water
line.
This
is
the
coupler
for
joining
one
pipeline
with
the
other
pipeline
when we want to extend the length of the pipeline.
Now ,
there
are
procedure
or
operational
procedure
one
should
use
and
these
are
very
important.
So,
these
are
say
prime
mover ,
pump.
It
should
have
the
proper
alignment
so
that
it
is
properly
fitted
and
then
main
and
lateral
pipeline.
Always
it
begin
from
the
pump.
First
the
pump,
then
from
the
pump
side
it
start
to
lay
means
attaching
first
main
pipeline
then,
with
the
main
pipeline,
lateral
pipelines
are
attached
and,
then
at
appropriate
location,
the
air
release
valves
as
well
as
the
other
valves
they
are
fitted.
Means
different
types
of
the
valves
which
are
required
at
different
places
they
are
fitted.
So,
the
pipe
as
well
as
sprinkler
lines
are
shifted
as
and
when
needed.
So,
when
we
are
doing
it,
this
is
the
operational
part,
system
should
be
closed
and
then,
one
should
shift
and
then,
after
fitting,
it
should
be
refitted
likewise.
So,
this
is
the
pipe
fitting.
So,
pipe
fitting,
when
we
are
putting
it,
the
pipe
should
be fitted such that there is a no leakage it takes place.
Sprinkler
head
as
already
I
have
told
you,
it
is
fitted
on
the
main
with
the
riser
pipeline.
Only
thing
that
make
sure
that
it
is
not
getting
damaged
and
one
should
not
use
oil
or
grease
or
any
lubricant.
It
is
a
water
lubricated
component.
So,
one
should
be
careful.
Otherwise,
it
will
stop
working.
So,
this
is
the
important
part
and
these
are
all
threaded.
So,
did
not
discuss
here.
You
may
refer
this
thing.
If
there
is
a
something
that
spring
got
loose,
so,
it
needs
tightening.
So,
it
should
be.
And
then,
another
part
is
that
all
the
component
they
should
be
kept
in
a
dry
place
and
cool
place
so
that
the
corrosion
does
not
take
place
so
that
should
be
also
important
part.
One
should
not
keep
the
racks
of
the
fertilizer
bags
in
the
same
room.
This may spoil the pipeline. So, this kind of a thing one should keep take care.While
we
are
putting
the
storage
of
the
system
after
the
use,
normally
it
is
brought
back
and
kept
it.
So,
this
should
be
taken
care
and
at
appropriate
location
the
grease,
the
shaft
and
the
pumps
should
be
checked
time
to
time
that
it
is
working
properly .
We
should
protect
the
electric motor from the ingress of dust, dampness and rodents.
There
are
some
problems
while
we
are
operating
the
system.
And
if,
so,
please
refer
these
notes
which
I
am
giving
here.
But,
just
I
am
giving
some
of
the
point
that
the
pump
does
not
prime
or
deliver
water .
What
could
be
the
reason?
So,
check
the
suction
pipeline
and
connections
for
air
leaks
where
there
is
an
air
leakage
takes
place.
So,
if
air
is
entering
in
the
pipeline,
it
will
not
be
so.
It
should
be
air
tight.
And
then,
also
one
should
see
whether
foot
valve
whether
it
has
got
blocked.
So,
this
could
be
another
reason.
So,
all
the
points
which
I
have
mentioned
here
and
this
should
be
taken
care
if
someone
find
that
pump
does
not
prime.
Means,
when
we
are
doing
it
particularly
in
centrifugal
pump,
priming
is
one
of
the
important
part
and
then
one
should
take
care.
So,
check
these
points
that
the
delivery
pipe
is
fully
filled
with
the
water
and
then
we
are
closing
and
then
we
are
running
the
pump.
So,
this
kind
of
thing should be taken care while we are doing it.
So,
the
other
point
is
that
sprinkler
do
not
turn.
So,
what
could
be
the
reason?
Means,
whether
there
is
an
adequate
pressure
we
are
putting
and
if
it
is
then
check
the
nozzle
it
is
not
blocked.
So,
we
need
to
unscrew
the
nozzle
or
check
the
sprinkler .
Usually ,
it
is
pushed
down
in
whether
it
has
gone
inside
the
riser
pipeline.
So,
it
should
be
rebrought.
But,
do
not,
again,
it
is
cautioned
or
given
that
do
not
use
oil,
grease
or
any
lubricant
in
the
sprinkler
head.
This
will
be
spoiled.
It
will
not
work.
And
then,
we
have
to
keep
all
the
fittings
if
there
are
some
components
in
some
part
of
the
washer
or
bottom
of
the
bearing,
so,
replace,
if
it
is
worn
out
or damaged. So, these points one should take care while see if the sprinkler do not operate.
Then,
you
see
that
the
swing
arm
spring
tension
whether
it
is
properly
tightened.
If
it
is
not,
then
one
has
to
pull
up
the
spring
by
more
than
about
6
millimeter .
Leakage
from
the
coupler
or
fitting,
this
is
a
clear
cut
if
it
is
like
this.
So,
one
has
to
open
and
refit
and
then
put
use
the
Teflon
thing.
If
it
is
worn
out,
replace
the
component
and
then,
take
care
that
part
because
leakage
part
it
is
very
clearly
visible.
So,
this
can
be
seen
and
so
that
the
water
does
not
getlost
as
it
is
a
valuable
resource.
And
then,
the
purpose
of
using
sprinkler
system
will
be
lost
if
a lot of leakage of water takes place from the couplers and fittings.
So,
for
this
particular
topic,
it
is
very
nicely
well
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
troubleshooting
in
this
particular
reference
and
then
for
the
layouts,
one
can
refer
the
Principles
of
Farm
Irrigation
System
Design
by
using
L
G
James.
And
there
are
other
references,
which
is
available
in
the
net
that
can
be
also
seen.
This
is
another
book
by
Christiansen J E. This book is also available in the net. You can see.
So,
in
this
lecture,
we
discussed
about
different
types
of
layouts
and
their
guideline.
We
also
discussed
about
operational
and
maintenance
guideline.
We
discussed
about
the
troubleshooting
required
while
we
are
operating
the
sprinkler
system.
So,
how
to
maintain
the
system?
Now ,
in
coming
class,
we
will
discuss
about
standardization
and
quality
experience
of micro irrigation system components. Thank you very much.
