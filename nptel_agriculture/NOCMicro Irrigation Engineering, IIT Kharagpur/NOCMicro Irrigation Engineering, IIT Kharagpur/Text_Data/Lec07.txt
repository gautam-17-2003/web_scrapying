Determination of Evapotranspiration
Hello
everybody ,
welcome
to
lecture
7.
In
lecture
6
we
discussed
about
evapotranspiration
various
terminologies
dealing
with
evapotranspiration.
We
also
discussed
a
direct
measurement
of
evapotranspiration
by
using
Lysimeter .
There
are
several
methods,
and
some
of
them
I
am
going to discuss in this lecture 7.
So,
here
we
will
be
discussing
methods,
which
are
based
on
water
balance,
methods
which
are
using climatological data where principle up ener gy balance is dealt.
So,
in
previous
lecture
6,
we
discussed
about
different
methods
in
which
we
were
talking
about
the
measurement
of
evapotranspiration
by
using
Lysimeter ,
by
taking
observations,
by
conducting
experiments,
or
by
collecting
data
of
soil
moisture
depletion
and
water
balance.
So,
we
will
discuss
some
of
these
methods
which
can
be
used
for
measurement,
and
then
there
is
an
indirect
way
of
estimating
evapotranspiration
by
using
climatological
data,
which
are
using
the
weather
parameters
such
as
temperature
or
using
radiation
or
combining
several
weather -based
data.
It
can
be
temperature,
it
can
be
radiation,
it
can
be
relative
humidity
or
various
other
parameters
such
as
vapor
pressure,
relative
humidity ,
taking
the
observations
taking
this
your
wind
velocity
or
using
pan
evaporimeter .
So,
let
us
try
to
go
into
detail
about
these
methods.
Of
course,
direct
measurement
methods
are
time-consuming
and
the
installation
of
several
gadgets
is
relatively
expensive.
However ,
they
give
a
closer
estimate
or
precise
estimate
of
evapotranspiration.
Whereas,
in
indirect
methods
here
one
or
more
metrological
data
are
used,
and
then
there
are
empiricalequations
that
have
been
established
for
a
specific
location
and
they
are
being
used
widely
by
several researchers.
Now ,
when
we
come
to
the
field
experimental
based
method,
in
this
particular
method
water
is
applied
to
the
field
and
it
is
measured
and
then
the
changes
in
the
soil
moisture
content
in
the
field
plots
are
measured
by
installing
several
soil
moisture
measurement
gadgets.
The
amount
of
water
which
is
supplied
is
measured
by
using
a
water
meter .
So,
a
seasonal
amount
of
irrigation
water is estimated.
WR=IR+ ER (M
s
 ‚Äì M
e
)
When
we
are
using
irrigation
water
(IR)
how
much
amount
of
irrigation
is
being
given,
what
is
the
effective
rainfall
(ER)
which
is
occurring,
when
we
are
multiplying
with
the
change
in
the
soil
moisture
content
means
initial
soil
moisture
content
(M
s
)
as
well
as
in
the
final
soil
moisture
content
at
the
end
of
the
season
(M
e
).
So,
the
seasonal
water
requirement
for
the
whole
crop
season
is
estimated
when
we
have
the
data
measured
the
amount
of
water
that
has
been
applied
for irrigation.
And
then
your
effective
rainfall
which
is
occurring
during
the
season.
Effective
rainfall
means
rainfall
that
is
stored
in
the
crop
root
zone
depth
and
that
is
used
by
the
plant
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration
requirement.
So,
this
amount
is
used
for
calculating
the
water
requirement.
Then this amount is utilized to determine the seasonal water requirement.
Of
course,
here
this
method
requires
precision
in
the
measurement
of
irrigation
water .
And
of
course,
the
information
means
of
the
soil
moisture
condition
for
the
short
term
water
use,
how
much
amount
of
water
which
is
stored
in
the
soil
profile,
how
much
amount
of
water
it
has
gone
as
deep
percolation
loss,
all
these
are
utilized
in
this
information
but
that
is
not
providing
the
full
complete
detail
about
how
much
amount
of
water
it
is
used
for
using
the
peak
moisture
use
rate
of the crop.
Soil
moisture
depletion
as
its
name
gives,
this
method
is
used
to
determine
the
conjunctive
use
of
field
crop
grown
on
fairly
uniform
soil
and
when
the
depth
to
groundwater
much
water
is
suchthat
it
does
not
influence
the
soil
moisture
fluctuation.
This
means
a
contribution
of
groundwater
by
capillary
action
in
the
root
zone
depth
does
not
influence.
It
is
one
of
the
important
considerations,
one
should
use
when
someone
wants
to
use
the
soil
moisture
depletion
method
for estimating the evapotranspiration requirement.
So,
this
particular
method
involves
soil
moisture
measurement
and
the
soil
profile
at
various
depths
and
during
the
entire
crop
season
period,
such
data
are
taken.
These
data
are
utilized
to
estimate
consumptive
use.
The
seasonal
consumptive
use
means
we
are
summing
the
consumptive
use
on
the
monthly
basis
or
daily
basis
and
then
total
seasonal
consumptive
use
is
estimated by using the equation.
ùë¢=ùëñ=1ùëõ‚àëùëÄ 1ùëñ‚àíùëÄ 2ùëñ1 0 0√óùê¥ ùëñ√óùê∑ ùëñ
Here
it
is
given
that
u
is
the
total
sum
of
the
moisture
depletion
in
layer
1,
moisture
depletion
in
layer
2,
so
the
total
number
of
soil
layers.
Suppose,
we
have
a
60
centimeter
of
the
soil
profile
in
which
we
are
dividing
it
into
four
soil
layers,
15
centimeters,
15
centimeters
these
four
layers
and
then
data
are
considered
from
each
layer
upon
layer
up
to
60
centimeter
root
zone
depth.
Then this moisture content at the first time means at the initial stage.
And
at
the
second
after
irrigation
when
you
have
given
weight
is
given.
So,
at
the
second
sampling,
this
difference
is
utilized
to
find
out
what
soil
moisture
depletion
it
has
taken
place.
Then
multiplying
the
apparent
specific
gravity
at
a
particular
layer
say
the
first
layer
is
15
centimeters
as
I
told
that
that
value
will
be
used
multiplying
the
depth
top
layer
that
will
be
15
centimeters at layer 1.
So,
that
will
be
the
amount
of
water
it
has
been
used
for
meeting
the
consumptive
use
of
the
crop.
Like
this
you
know
for
the
entire
whole
crop
season
such
data
are
utilized
and
then
the
total
consumptive use for the crops region is estimated.The
water
balanced
method
here
as
you
can
see
on
the
right
side
of
the
diagram.
So,
precipitation
or
irrigation
can
be
the
input
and
then
the
water
which
is
in
the
study
area
whatever
it
is
falling.
So,
this
water
if
it
becomes
more
than
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil.
Then
what
happened
this
water
appears
as
surface
runof f
and
then
the
part
of
the
water
which
infiltrates
below
the
soil
surface and then this water is causing the increase in the soil moisture content.
So,
increase
in
the
soil
moisture
content
which
is
known
as
the
soil
water ,
and
if
it
becomes
more
than
the
water
holding
capacity
of
the
soil
this
water
goes
as
deep
percolation
that
causes
the
rise
of
the
water
table.
So,
there
will
be
input
components
from
the
groundwater
that
will
be
the
capillary
water ,
some
water
it
will
go
as
percolation,
some
water
it
will
use
for
the
evaporation,
water
which
is
used
by
the
crop
for
transpiration.
So,
the
combined
term
is
used
to
find
out
the
evapotranspiration requirements.
So,
precipitation
and
irrigation
are
balance
with
the
evapotranspiration
plus
surface
runof f
and
sub-surface
drainage
that
is
a
deep
percolation
which
I
am
telling
here,
and
then
the
change
in
soil
moisture
content.
So,
if
all
the
parameters
which
are
influencing
this
water
balance
are
measured
except
the
evapotranspiration.
So,
that
evapotranspiration
value
is
estimated
by
balancing all the terms.
Now ,
indirect
way
of
estimating
evapotranspiration.
When
only
temperature
data
are
available
it
is
Thornthwaite,
he
established
the
evapotranspiration
by
using
the
temperature
data.
Then
Soil
Conservation
Service
Blaney-Criddle
method
or
Hargreaves
method
are
solely
based
on
the
temperature
data.
Radiation-based
data,
these
are
Turc,
Priestley
Taylor ,
Jensen-Haise,
FAO
24
radiation
method
using
the
radiation-based
method
and
combining
the
energy
balance
means
that
is your radiation and temperature.
So,
Penman,
Penman-Monteith,
and
FAO
56
penmen
Monteith,
these
methods
are
utilizing
the
temperature
as
well
as
the
radiation,
relative
humidity
as
well
as
wind
speed
these
data
have
beenutilized
to
compute
evapotranspiration.
Pan
Evaporimeter ,
is
a
simple
method
this
has
also
been
utilized to determine the evapotranspiration of the crop.
Now ,
let
us
discuss
in
detail
about
the
indirect
way
of
estimating
the
evapotranspiration,
where
temperature
alone
is
used.
So,
the
Blaney-Criddle
method
is
one
of
the
methods
established
as
early
as
1950.
And
this
method
requires
temperature
as
well
as
daylight
hours,
how
many
hours
of
sunshine
hours
are
available
in
a
particular
month.
This
daylight
hour
is
a
factor
which
is
purely depending on the latitude of a particular place.
So,
the
Blaney-Criddle
approach
estimates
the
potential
evapotranspiration
by
using
the
equation
here it is given by
Now ,
PET
is
the
potential
evapotranspiration
in
millimeters
per
day.
Which
is
a
mean
value
over
the
month
and
p
is
here
is
written
here
it
should
be
small
p
so,
that
is
a
monthly
percentage
of
the
total
daytime
hours
of
the
year
in
a
particular
month.
Capital
T
refers
to
mean
monthly
temperature
in
degrees
Celsius,
which
is
the
average
of
daily
maximum
and
a
minimum
temperature value.
Where,
U = seasonal consumptive use of water by the crop for a given period (mm)
u = monthly consumptive use (mm)
K = empirical seasonal consumptive use consumptive us for the growing season
F = sum of the monthly consumptive use factors (f) for the growing season
k = empirical consumptive use crop coef ficient for the month (u/f)
f = value of monthly PET  (mm)
So,
having
got
this
value
for
each
month
(f)
so
we
will
sum
all
the
monthly
data
for
the
entire
crop
season.
If
the
crop
says
it
is
of
120
days
duration
so,
for
each
month,
month
1
that
is
30
days
plus
30
days
plus
30
days
like
120
days
data
of
these
u
value
that
is
your
potential
evapotranspiration
values
are
summed
and
then
these
values
are
obtained
to
get
the
total
seasonal
consumptive use (U) of the values.
Then
Thornthwaite
method,
of
course,
this
method
considered
as
one
of
the
pioneering
person
who
brought
the
concept
of
potential
evapotranspiration.
And
he
established
this
method
purely
by
taking
the
mean
monthly
temperature
as
early
as
1948.
And
he
established
that
potential
evapotranspiration
is
exponentially
related
to
mean
monthly
temperature.
And
the
established
relationship that
Where,       
e = unadjusted PET  (cm per month)
t = mean air temperature (¬∞C)
I = annual or seasonal heat index, the summation of 12 values of monthly heat indices (i) when,
i = ( t / 5 )
1.514
Now , ‚Äòa‚Äô is the exponent which is given by
ùëé=0.0000006751ùêº3
(
)‚àí0.000071ùêº2
(
)+0.01792ùêº()+0.49239
Now ,
I
is
the
annual
heat
index
and
this
is
computed
by
taking
the
temperature
data,
what
is
this
temperature
data?
It
is
a
mean
monthly
air
temperature.
So,
for
each
individual
these
I
have
to
be
estimated
that
it
is
small
i
that
is
for
each
month
and
this
will
be
summed
up
for
all
total
months
and this e is the unadjusted potential evapotranspiration.
Unadjusted
means,
here
we
are
considering
per
month.
So,
a
month
is
taken
as
30
days.
Suppose
a
particular
month
is
31
days,
then
whatever
value
we
have
estimated
will
be
multiplied
by
31
by
30.
So,
we
will
get
a
factor
that
will
be
multiplied
by
the
estimated
value.
So,
we
here,
in
this
particular
method
we
are
using
mean
air
temperature
as
t,
and
then
we
are
computing
from
this
mean air temperature is small i.
And
this
temperature
is
for
say
we
have
got
12-month
data.
So,
it
is
per
day
say
January
1.
So,
the
mean
monthly
temperature
of
January
1
will
be
used
divided
by
5
to
the
power
1.514
that
will
be
the
small
i
for
January
month.
Then
similarly
for
February
month
like
this,
you
know
up
to
December
all
12
months
i‚Äôs
will
be
calculated.
These
‚Äòi‚Äô
will
sum
up,
all
these
small
i
will
give
capital
I
and
that
will
be
utilized
to
find
out
the
unadjusted
and
then
this
will
be
adjusted
and
corrected value of the potential evapotranspiration will be determined.
Hargreaves
method
is
another
method.
He
establish
the
potential
evapotranspiration
based
on
the
data
collected
from
the
Lysimeter
which
had
green
grass
covering
the
entire
Lysimeter .
So,
he
proposed an equation which is given as
Now ,
t
is
the
mean
monthly
temperature
in
degrees
Celsius,
R
S
is
the
incident
solar
radiation
in
Langleys per day .
Now ,
Langley
to
convert
in
millimeters
per
day
means
these
incident
radiations
in
mm
per
day
one
has
to
multiply
with
10
divided
by
the
latent
heat
of
the
water .
This
will
give
the
value
in
millimeters
per
day
and
then
temperature
data.
We
have
to
use
it
in
the
mean
daily
temperature
like this one has to obtain the potential evapotranspiration.
Another
method
is
the
FAO
Penman-Monteith
equation.
There
are
a
large
number
of
methods.
Now
I
am
coming
to
the
most
precise
method
which
has
been
advocated
by
several
agencies
and
FAO
56
method
has
been
proposed
as
an
accurate
value
that
gives
an
estimate
of
reference
evapotranspiration,
ET
0
if
you
remember
we
discussed
in
previous

about
ET

.
So,
ET
0
is
known as a reference crop evapotranspiration.
So, reference crop evapotranspiration ET

is given
by

‚àÜ+Œ≥(1+0.3 4ùë¢ 2)
Where
ET
0
is
the
reference
evapotranspiration
which
is
expressed
in
mm
per
day.
R
n
refers
to
net
radiation
at
crop
surface,
which
is
given
by
MJ/
m
2
/
day,
and
T
is
the
mean
daily
air
temperature
at
2-meter
height.
This
is
taken
as
a
reference
height.
So,
the
temperature
measured
at
any
other
height
has
to
be
converted
to
a
2-meter
height.
Simply
wind
speed
is
also
collected
at
any
other
height
that
has
to
be
converted
for
the
region
in
FAO
56.
This
conversion
factor
is
available.
e
s
is
the
saturation
vapor
pressure.
So,
this
is
from
the
evaporating
body
when
the
ideal
condition
is
maintained
at
saturation
vapor
pressure
is
measured.
Then
actual
vapor
pressure
means
at
a
given
air
temperature
what
is
the
actual
vapor
pressure
that
exists
at
any
height
that
has
to
be
used
in
this
equation.
And
then
the
difference
in
or
deficit
in
the
saturation
paper
pressure
that
is
causing
the
evapotranspiration
is
the
difference
in
e
s
minus
e
a
.
Delta
refers
to
the
slope
of
the
vapor
pressure
curve.
So,
this
slope
is
plotted
between
e
s
minus
e
a
with
the
temperature.
So,
this
slope
is
practically
it
is
given
by
kilo
Pascal
per
degree
Celsius
and
gamma
is the psychometric constant. So, this is also obtained by using a psychometric chart.
So,
reference
evapotranspiration
the
ET
0
provides
a
standard
to
which
evapotranspiration
at
different
periods
of
the
year
or
in
other
regions
can
be
compared.
Evapotranspiration
of
several
crops
can
be
related
to
ET
0
.
Now ,
this
particular
method
can
be
applied
in
a
wide
variety
of
conditions,
it
can
be
applied
in
an
arid
region,
it
can
be
applied
in
the
semi-arid
region,
it
can
be
applied in the humid and Sub-humid region. This is the advantage compared to other methods.
Of
course,
there
is
a
limitation
it
involves
several
weather
parameters
like
you
know
the
minimum
temperature,
maximum
temperature,
minimum
relative
humidity ,
maximum
relative
humidity ,
wind
speed
at
2-meter
height
solar
radiation
sunshine
hour.
So,
several
parameters
are
required
which
is
one
of
the
major
limitations
when
someone
wants
to
use
the
FAO
56
Penman-Monteith equation.
But,
it
gives
the
precise
estimate
of
ET
0
and
it
can
provide
the
basis
for
developing
consistent
crop
coefficient
value
and
that
I
am
going
to
discuss
in
the
coming
lectures.
So,
crop
coefficientalso
one
can
be
used
after
getting
the
value
of
ET
0
,
and
ET
c
if
someone
has
got
from
the
experiments, then K
c
can be established.
Pan
evaporation
method
or
Pan
Evaporimeter ,
is
a
simple
method
and
this
is
available
in
the
majority
of
the
agro
meteorological
observatory
and
here
the
pan
data
can
be
used
to
find
out
the
different
evapotranspiration.
So,
a
pan
is
made
up
of
stainless
steel
cylinder ,
the
diameter
of
the
pan is 120.7 cm inner diameter of the cylinder and the depth of this pan is 25 centimeters.
Then,
the
water
level
in
the
Pan
is
maintained
about
20
centimeters
and
at
one
end
of
this
particular
pan,
there
is
a
stilling
basin.
So,
whatever
water
is
available
in
the
pan
in
the
stilling
basin
same
level
of
water
is
used.
So,
when
we
are
taking
an
observation,
it
does
not
get
disturb
the
water
level
in
the
pan.
So,
the
amount
of
water
depleted
due
to
evaporation
is
measured
in
the
stilling basin by using a hook gauge.
So,
the
amount
of
water
evaporating
from
the
pan
is
determined
by
measuring
the
change
in
the
water
level
in
the
stilling
basin
provided
in
the
pan
and
correcting
whatever
precipitation
or
rainfall
had
occurred.
So,
rainfall
data
is
measured
by
using
the
rain
gauge
and
that
data
is
subtracted
from
whatever
rain
had
occurred
during
the
irrigation,
during
the
measurement
period
in one day , normally observation is collected once in 24 hours.
There
are
several
Pans
available.
In
India,
we
have
the
Indian
Metrological
Department
(IMD)
they
have
also
established
the
standard
size
of
the
pan
which
is
similar
to
the
same
dimension
as
per
the
US
Weather
Bureau
Reclamation.
A
Pan
Evaporimeter
is
most
commonly
used
for
estimating
the
pan
evaporation.
And,
it
is
a
relatively
simple
device
inexpensive
device
and
to
determine the evaporative capability of the atmosphere.
So,
the
atmosphere
provides
energy
to
withdraw
water
in
the
form
of
water
vapor
from
the
surface.
So,
reference
crop
evapotranspiration
which
we
call
ET
0
is
related
to
the
evaporation
taking place from a pan.ET
o
= E
p
√ó k
p
Now ,
we
can
say
the
actual
value
of
the
pan
value
which
we
are
using,
we
are
required
to
multiply it with the pan coef ficient. So, we will discuss the pan coef ficient (K
p
).
So,
a
reference
crop
evapotranspiration
is
expressed
in
millimeters
per
day
and
the
amount
of
evaporation that is taking place from a pan is given by E p and then K p is the pan coef ficient.
Now ,
pan
coefficient
values
one
has
to
multiply
depending
on
the
condition
in
which
a
pan
is
kept.
So,
this
particular
table
explains
the
pan
coefficient
for
a
different
pan
sitting
and
environmental
as
well
as
a
different
level
of
relative
humidity ,
wind
speed.
So,
FAO
irrigation
underneath
paper
24
provides
this
table
and
this
is
a
standard
table
that
is
followed
in
all
the
conditions.
So,
class
A
pan
was
placed
in
a
short
green
grass-covered
area.
If
there
is
in
the
adjoining
area,
green
grass
and
the
relative
humidity
conditions
are
say
if
it
is
low
humidity ,
if
it
is
a
medium
humidity ,
if
it
is
high
humidity
and
then
what
are
the
wind
speed
prevailing
in
that
particular
region
when
the
data
are
being
collected.
So,
wind
speed
if
it
is
light
means
when
it
is
less
than
2
meters per second when it is a moderate 2 to 5 if it is strong if it is very strong.
So,
far
relative
humidity
condition
and
then
what
is
facing
the
particularly
green
grass
it
exists
at
this
site
at
the
particular
site
of
the
class
A
pan.
If
it
is
1
meter
if
it
is
10
meters
if
it
is
100
meters.
So,
the
green
grass
stands
opposite
to
the
side
of
the
adjoining
your
pan.
So,
accordingly ,
the
crop
coefficient
value
lets
say
that
if
the
relative
humidity
is
less
than
40%
and
the
wind
speed is light.
So,
and
then
it
is
a
short
green
grass
it
is
available
at
10
meters
at
the
adjoining
of
the
pan.
The
value
of
pan
coefficient
ID
is
0.65.
If
it
is
100
meters
at
0.7,
if
it
is
you
know
1000
meters
means
it
is
one
kilometer
then
0.75.
If
it
is
you
know
relative
humidity
is
40
to
70%
the
value
if
say
it
is1
kilometer
away
then
it
is
your
0.85
then
greater
than
70%
for
the
same
in
all
wind
conditions
at
0.85.
Now ,
if
the
pan
is
kept
in
a
dry
place
fallow
land
the
values
of
the
value
of
pan
coefficient
will
differ.
So,
depending
on
the
site
at
which
pan
evaporation
is
kept
one
has
to
use
the
appropriate
value
of
pan
coefficient
to
obtain
the
value
of
the
correct
value
of
the
pan
evaporation,
reference
evapotranspiration.
Now ,
this
particular
value
of
ET
0
is
to
be
multiplied
with
the
crop
coefficient,
so, as to get the evapotranspiration requirement of a particular crop.
So,
let
us
summarize
this
lecture
we
have
discussed
about
different
methods
of
determining
evapotranspiration
and
that
is
your
direct
method
which
is
field-based,
experiment-based,
soil
moisture
depletion
based,
or
field
water
balance
by
method.
Another
one
we
discussed
about
using
the
indirect
way
that
it
is
by
using
the
weather
parameters
by
Blaney-Criddle,
Hargreaves,
Thornthwaite, F AO Penman-Monteith equation, and Pan Evaporation.
So,
and
then
the
fourth
coming
lecture
we
will
discuss
about
the
crop
coefficient
and
how
to
determine the water requirement of the crop.
And
you
may
refer
to
this
literature
in
detail
to
get
more
information
if
you
want
to
learn.
So,
these
books
as
well
as
the
FAO
56
which
can
be
used
as
the
main
reference
paper
which
is
a
base
for
many
of
these
books,
they
are
quoting
this
reference
so
FAO
56,
FAO
24
are
the
two
main
manuals.
These
two
manuals
are
the
base
for
establishing
the
Lysimetric
base
experiment
conducting
or
by
using
the
different
other
metrological
data
observations.
So,
thank
you
very
much and good day .
