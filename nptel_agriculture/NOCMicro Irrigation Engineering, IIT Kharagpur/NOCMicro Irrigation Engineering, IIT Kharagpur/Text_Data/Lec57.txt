Economic Analysis of MIS (Part 3)
Hello,
participants.
Now ,
we
are
entering
in
Lecture
57
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
subject.
This
is
on
economic
analysis
of
Micro
Irrigation
System,
Part
3.
In
Part
1,
we
discussed
various
terminologies
dealing
with
economic
analysis.
In
Lecture
56,
we
discussed
about
optimal
flow
criteria
as
well
as
the
critical
velocity ,
maximum
velocity
criteria.
And
using
the
maximum
velocity
as
well
as
optimal
flow
criteria,
we
analyzed
how
to
find
out
the
economic pipe sizes as well as the size of the pump?
Here,
the
economic
analysis
in
this
lecture,
we
are
dealing
with
in
a
different
way.
And
then,
some
of
the
results
which
we
obtained
from
our
experimental
study ,
those
results
have
been
used
to
analyze
the
economic
value.
Cost
economics
of
the
product
produced
which
is
coming
out
of
the
experimental
field
and
how
whether
system
is
optimal.
Economical
as
well
as
optimal
that
can
be
used.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
are
going
to
cover
economic
evaluation
considering
the
optimal
spacing
of
laterals.
Economic
analysis
considering
the
experimental data which we obtained from our field experiments.
Now ,
the
term
which
is
very
important,
which
we
deal
in
economic
analysis
is
Net
Present
Value
and
Benefit
Cost
Ratio.
So,
NPV
in
short
form
of
Net
Present
Value.
It
is
the
difference
between
the
sum
of
the
present
value
of
benefits
and
that
of
costs
associated
with
capital
and
depreciation
of
MI
system
components.
Now ,
here,
in
terms
of
Net
Present
Value
of
micro
irrigation
system
is
will
be
economically
viable
if
the
present
value
of
benefit
is
greater
than
the
present
value
of
the
cost
which
is
we
are
going
to
incur
while
we
are
installing
the
system
while we are doing the cultivation of a particular crop.
So,
BCR
that
is
a
Benefit
Cost
Ratio,
it
is
related
with
the
Net
Present
Value.
And,
it
is
obtained
by
simply
dividing
the
present
value
of
benefits
and
to
that
of
the
cost
stream.
Now ,
when
we
say
the
Benefit
Cost
Ratio,
so,
a
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
greater
than
1,
it
implies
that
theNet
Present
Value
of
the
benefit
stream
is
higher
than
that
of
the
cost
stream.
And,
system
that
is
irrigation
system
is
economical
viable.
It
will
be
only
economically
viable
when
Benefit Cost Ratio is greater than 1.
We need to estimate Net Present Value by using this equation.
𝑁𝑃𝑉=𝑡=1𝑡=𝑛∑𝐵 𝑡−𝐶 𝑡
(1+𝑖)𝑡
where,
B
t
= benefit in year (t)
C
t
= cost in year (t)
t = 1, 2, 3…, n
n = project or expected life of MI components (year)
i = rate of discount (%)
(or opportunity cost of investment)
This
expression
is
very
clearly
given.
That
is
the
benefit
at
any
time
t
in
years
minus
the
cost
associated
divided
by
1
plus
the
present
rate
of
discount
or
prevailing
bank
interest
to
the
power
the
time
period.
So,
this
is
the
expression
which
is
used
to
find
out
the
Net
Present
Value.
Then,
Benefit
Cost
Ratio,
which
was
given
that
benefit
in
any
time
period
t
that
is
in
a
year.
𝐵𝐶𝑅=𝑡=1𝑡=𝑛∑𝐵 𝑡
(1+𝑖)𝑡
𝑡=1𝑡=𝑛∑𝐶 𝑡
(1+𝑖)𝑡
So,
sum
of
all
the
years
it
is
estimated
divided
by
the
1
plus
i
to
the
power
t.
And,
divided
means
for
that
it
is
that
cost
associated
in
a
given
period.
So,
this
way,
the
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
is obtained.
The
few
assumptions
which
are
required
in
estimation
of
both
cash
inflow
and
outflows
for
the
micro
irrigation
system
to
carry
out
benefit
and
cost
analysis.
These
assumptions
are
the
life
period
of
micro
irrigation
system
it
depends
on
the
type
of
crop.
Mainly ,
crop
there
could
be
some
seasonal
crop
which
means
seasonal
vegetable
crop
or
it
can
be
the
crops
like
Banana,
Papaya.
Such
crops
having
short
duration
crop.
But,
crops
like
Sapota,
Mango,
citrusgroup,
Oranges,
Lychee
such
crops
are
long
duration
crops.
So,
these
crops
period
is
also
used
while
we
are
estimating
the
cost
as
well
as
the
benefit
when
we
will
be
doing.
So,
income
stream
from
the
micro
irrigation
is
uniform
and
constant.
It
is
we
are
putting
for
over
the entire life of the crop.
Now ,
interest
rate
one
has
to
see
that
what
is
the
gain
which
we
are
getting
with
various,
so,
sensitive
analysis
has
to
be
carried
out.
So,
these
interest
rates
are
considered
to
undertake
the
sensitivity
of
investment
which
we
have
made.
So,
these
could
be
10%,
12%,
15%
as
the
alternative
representing
the
various
opportunity
cost
of
the
capital.
Finally ,
the
crop
cultivation
technology
is
assumed
to
be
constant
for
considering
the
same
group
of
crops.
So,
any
group
long
duration
as
well
as
short
duration
crops.
So,
they
are
brought
under
the
same
category .
Now ,
that
is
one
way
of
making
estimation.
Here,
we
are
considering
that
how
to
reduce
the
total
length
of
lateral.
So,
means
we
need
to
find
out
how
the
water
is
distributed
by
using
a
drip
emitter
and
then
accordingly ,
the
spacing
between
the
lateral
can
be
adjusted.
So,
major
limiting
factor
as
we
know ,
it
is
the
drip
irrigation
system
components
and
where
you
find
that the laterals as well as drippers.
They
are
these
are
the
major
component
where
cost
comes
into
picture.
So,
can
we
reduce
the
number
of
drippers?
Can
we
reduce
the
length
of
lateral?
So,
this
is
only
possible
in
such
a
way
that
it
should
not
form
run
off.
The
water
should
not
go
beyond
the
root
zone
depth.
And,
it
should
not,
we
should
see
that
how
to
adjust
the
spacing
of
the
lateral.
So,
this
can
be,
such a study means for finding out the optimal spacing.
This
can
be
done
once
we
have
the
data
related
to
water
advancement
or
water
front
movement
from
the
drip
emitter
and
then
optimizing
the
spacing
of
the
lateral.
Another
one
is
by
considering
the
crop
geometry
means
planting
geometry .
And
so,
we
will
discuss
in
detail.
So,
one
is
that
changing
the
crop
planting
geometry
such
that
the
total
length
of
the
lateral
can
be
reduced.
And
then,
other
one
is
by
taking
the
analysis
by
considering
the
field
experimental
data.
So,
this
3
types
of
things
which
we
are
going
to
discuss
in
this
particular
presentation.So,
in
this
presentation
which
we
are
taking
it
is
the
water
front
advance
under
point
source
drip
emitters.
That
depends
on
the
soil
type.
What
is
the
soil
texture?
Because,
the
water
front
movement
will
depend
upon
the
soil
texture.
What
is
the
dripper
dischar ge?
How
long
dripper
is
being
operated?
So,
that
will
be
the
one
component.
So,
water
front
advance
means
this
is
the
advancement
in
overland
surface
which
will
be
in
a
radial
direction
and
then,
water
front
movement
or
water
advancement
below
the
root
zone
depth
that
means
the
downward
movement.
So,
r
and
z
component
of
the
water
distribution
is
considered.
So,
larger
operation
time
results
larger
lateral
spacing,
but
simultaneously
result
into
the
deep
percolation
losses.
This
is
not
desired.
So,
because
of
the
consequential
larger
vertical
movement
in
water ,
if
you
are
allowing
the
larger
time
that
it
may
go
below
the
root
zone
depth.
That
is
one
part.
So,
horizontal
advancement
corresponding
to
operation
duration
of
the
drip
emitter
that
result
into
vertical
advancement
equal
to
the
root
zone
depth.
That
is
important
consideration
one
has to take while we are taking the spacing of the dripper .
So,
we
carried
out
this
research
studies
at
the
experimental
level
by
bringing
the
soil
from
the
field.
So,
we
have
taken
different
types
of
soils
which
are
sandy
loam
in
texture
which
is
also
black
cotton
soil.
We
brought
all
the
way
from
Maharashtra
and
then
the
studies
which
we
were
done.
So,
here,
what
you
are
seeing,
this
is
a
soil
tank
model
where
the
water
is
being
distributed from a dripper .
And
then,
you
can
see
here
how
the
water
front
it
is
moving.
So,
water
is
moving
in
the
radial
direction.
This
is
surface
movement
of
water
how
it
is
taking
place.
And
then,
at
the
same
time,
when
we
are
putting
it
you
can
see
here
how
the
water
is
going
deeper .
So,
the
time
of
operation
of
a
particular
size
of
dripper
will
be
depending
on
the
size
of
the
dripper .
It
will
depend upon the particular type of the soil.
So,
soil
moisture
distribution
under
point
source
drip
emitter
in
layered
soil.
Here,
it
is
not
only
one
particular
soil,
but
at
certain
depth,
another
soil
it
exist.
That
is
a
common
thingwhich
exists
in
the
field
condition.
We
carried
out
theoretical
studies
as
well
as
experimental
studies in order to find out the spacing of the laterals.
So,
this
is
one
study
which
has
been
done
for
sandy
loam
soil.
Then,
the
crop
was
grown
Okra.
The
study
has
been
carried
out
at
Indian
Agricultural
Research
Institute,
New
Delhi
by
Dr.
Neelam
Patel
and
Dr.
TBS
Rao
Rajput
in
the
year
2001.
And,
they
took
study
using
the
drippers
of
2
liter,
4
liter
and
6
liter
per
hour
capacity .
And
then,
they
operated
the
dripper
for
12 hours, 6 hours and 4 hours, respectively .
Means,
the
volume
of
water
was
given
same,
but
the
time
of
operation
was
different.
And
then,
from
their
studies,
they
found
that
the
4
liter
per
hour
dripper
it
is
giving
the
optimal
length
of
the
lateral
as
well
as
the
optimal
lateral
spacing
of
92.5
centimeter ,
but,
for
Okra
crop.
So,
Okra
crop
it
may
need
people
they
give
very
closer
spacing
of
the
lateral.
That
can
be decided depending on the dischar ge.
And
then,
another
study ,
this
is
also
carried
out
in
the
sandy
loam
soil
for
the
Okra
crop
by
Jaiswal
et
al.
in
2001.
And,
what
they
did,
they
found
that
the
optimal
length
of
the
lateral
was
28.76,
59.7,
17.1
meter
for
the
dischar ge
capacity
of
4
liter
per
hour
when
the
drippers
is
placed
in
the
different
spacing.
When
the
drippers
were
placed,
so
that
way
they
found
out
what should be the optimal length of the lateral.
Then,
for
the
same
area,
they
also
took
the
dischar ge
for
this
similar
study
for
the
8
liter
per
hour
and
they
determined
the
optimal
length
of
the
lateral.
Then,
they
found
from
the
study
that
4
liter
per
hour
dripper
for
sandy
loam
type
of
soil,
it
is
giving
better
optimal
length
as
compared to 8 liter per hour .
The
study
carried
out
at
IIT
Kharagpur
by
my
group
of
students
in
the
year
1997
for
Banana
crop.
And,
we
took
this
study
where
we
have
taken
different
planting
geometry .
Planting
geometry
here
it
means
that
we
are
putting
normally
you
may
find
that
the
Banana
when
we
are
giving
water ,
there
are
clusters
of
the
group
of
the
Banana
plant
automatically
it
comes
from
the
same
one
mother
plant.
And
then,
there
will
be
several
suckers
which
will
becoming.
So,
in
the
same
manner ,
we
saw
that
this
is
coming
by
natural
way,
why
can
we
not
have the study so that we can reduce the length of lateral.
So,
what
we
did,
we
have
taken
1
plant,
2
plants,
3
plants
and
4
plants
adjacent
to
each
other
and
by
considering
the
plant
to
plant
and
row
to
row
spacing,
different
spacing
we
have
given.
By
taking
the
area
under
each
plant
is
4
square
meter .
That
is
2
meter
by
2
meter .
Then,
we
gave
irrigation
amount
of
water
by
using
estimating
from
the
weather
data,
climatic
data
by
using
the
modified
Penman
method
and
estimated
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
And
then,
the
study
which
was
carried
out,
we
found
out
that
what
should
be
the
cost
of
cultivation
per
hectare.
So,
the
per
hectare
class
it
came
as
a
26,300
rupees
during
the
prevailing market price of 1994, 95, 96 by 96.
So,
this
is
the
way
you
can
see
here,
how
the
planting
it
has
been
done.
This
is
one
of
the
planting
system.
So,
this
is
one
of
the
planting
system
what
we
have
given
that
you
can
see
here.
There
is
means
the
spacing
between
the
lateral
is
6
meter .
A
typical
spacing
is
2
meter
by
2
meter .
So,
every
2
meter ,
there
will
be
but
here
we
have
taken
6
meter .
And
then,
there
are
3
plants
side
by
side.
So,
this
is
smaller
dots
which
we
see.
These
are
the
plantation
and
then,
the
plant
to
plant
is
spacing
is
2
meter .
So,
this
is
the
one
way
of
putting
the
plantation
where number of plants per hectare area is 2,500, number of laterals which we used as 34.
The
layout
of
the
field
which
you
see
here
it
is
98
meter
wide
and
102
meter
long.
And
then,
this
is
the
one
we
have
combination.
Another
geometry
which
we
have
taken,
means
the
spacing
between
the
lateral
is
8
meter .
Means,
purpose
is
that
how
to
reduce
the
length
of
lateral.
And
then,
planting
it
is
done.
That
is,
between
2
meter
by
2
meter .
But,
there
are
4
plants
adjacent
to
each
other .
So,
number
of
lateral,
here,
you
are
seeing
here,
it
is
34
whereas
it
is
reduced
to
26.
And
then,
total
length
of
the
lateral
in
this
case
it
was
1,632.
And
here,
it
is 1,222. And then, we took such observation and then yield data were recorded.
So,
altogether ,
there
were
16
planting
geometry
which
we
have
considered.
And,
what
we
found
that
2
meter
by
2
meter
spacing
it
is
giving
best
response
where
other
as
from
the
length
point
of
view
what
we
are
finding
that
length
of
the
lateral
in
the
different
planting
geometry
it
varied
from
1,222
meter
to
4,900
meter .
4,900
meter
was
for
2
meter
by
2
meterspacing.
Whereas,
this
one
just
now
which
I
was
showing
you
that
where
the
4
plants
were
and
then
lateral
spacing
was
8
meter .
So,
this
way
and
then
the
data
as
well
as
from
the
length
point
of
view
what
we
found
that
this
is
giving
best
response.
That
is
1.33
meter
is
the
plant
to
plant
spacing
and
3
meter
is
row
to
row
spacing
which
require
3,290
meter
length
of
the
lateral with the Benefit Cost Ratio of 3.09.
So,
what
we
find
that
the
plant
to
plant
spacing
of
1.33
meter ,
keeping
1
plant
in
each
pit
and
row
to
row
spacing
of
3
meter
is
recommended
for
the
dwarf
Cavendish
variety
of
the
Banana
cultivation
to
minimize
the
cost
of
this
system.
That
is
one
study .
Then,
similar
study
we
carried
out
for
the
Okra
crop
at
IIT
Kharagpur
by
my
group.
They
have
done
work.
And,
what
they
found
that
the
planting
geometry
for
the
Okra,
it
should
be
done
at
30
centimeter
by
30
centimeter
and
lateral
spacing
of
2.4
meter .
It
is
giving
best
response
in
terms
of
the
yield.
That
is
14.89
tons
per
hectare
with
the
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
of
2.18.
And
then,
the
yield
per
millimeter
of
water
used
is
22.39
kilogram
per
hectare.
This
is
the
water
use
efficiency .
So, this is another study considering the planting geometry .
Now ,
some
of
the
experimental
trial
and
the
results
which
came
from
the
trial
this
study
is
taken
up
in
a
different
angle
that
if
the
drip
system
is
adopted
for
some
of
these
crops,
horticultural
crops,
how
those
results
are
beneficial
and
then
from
the
benefit
cost
analysis
which
particular
crop
which
is
giving
best
results
as
compared
to
the
conventional
method
of
irrigation.
So,
there
is
a
one
agency
which
funded
the
project
of
Precision
Farming
Development.
This
is
a
Ministry
of
Agriculture,
Government
of
India
funded
project.
That
is
National
Committee
on
Plasticulture
Applications
in
Horticulture
that
is
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Farmers
Welfare.
That
is
the
agency
where
large
number
of
crop
experiments
were
taken
on
the
fruits
crop, vegetable crops and there are many other flowers etcetera we took study .
We
recorded
the
observations
on
the
biometric
response.
That
is
yield
as
well
as
there
are
other
parameters,
biometric
observations,
the
date
of
emer gence
of
flower
and
the
response
with
respect
to
different
methods
of
irrigation.
That
is
a
ring
basin
or
check
basin
or
furrow
irrigation
method.
That
is
a
conventional
irrigation
and
then
these
data
which
we
obtainedwere
compared
with
the
drip
irrigation
system
and
then
the
economic
analysis
has
been
carried out.
So,
economic
analysis,
when
we
carried
out,
it
involves
certain
steps.
So,
these
steps
are
stated
here.
So,
we
assume
that
the
life
of
the
drip
system,
that
is
your
micro
irrigation
system,
it
varies
from
7
years
to
10
years.
In
fact,
based
on
my
personal
experience,
whatever
the
systems
we
installed
in
our
field,
these
are
as
old
and
is
still
these
components
are
functional.
Considering
the
life
of
the
systems
and
components,
we
are
estimating
the
depreciation
cost.
If
you
remember ,
we
discussed
about
the,
these
life
of
the
components.
So,
in
the
previous
class,
when
we
were
doing
the
economic
analysis,
we
have
already
given
a
table.
And
that
table
can
be
used
to
find
out
the
life
of
the
system
components.
So,
here,
the
depreciation
cost
is
obtained
considering
if
it
is
linear ,
we
can
consider
that
every
year
how
much
it
will
be,
bringing
down
the
price.
And
then,
prevailing
bank
rate
interest
particularly
for
agriculture,
it
is
a
lower
rate
interest
that
should
be
used
to
calculate
the
interest
rate.
And
then,
the
annual
repair
and
maintenance
cost,
it
is
considered
as
1%
of
the
annual
cost.
And
then,
total
cost
of
the
system
is
the
sum
of
the
depreciation
cost
sum
of
the
interest
and
then
annual
repair
maintenance. So, this will be coming as a total cost.
And
then,
this
is
a
variable
cost
which
will
be
changing
year
to
year.
Of
course,
some
of
the
cost
it
is
once
a
long
duration
crop.
So,
planting
material,
seed,
if
it
is
a
long
duration,
if
it
is
a
means
short
duration
seasonal
crop,
then
it
can
be
seedlings,
planting,
intercultural
operation,
cost
of
fertilizers,
manures,
plant
protection
chemicals.
These
are
some
considered
as
operating
cost
or
cost
of
operation.
So,
total
cost
will
be
having
the
cost
of
cultivation
plus
the
total
cost
which
we
calculated
in
the
Step
1
which
is
as
1e
plus
the
item
to
this
one
which
we
are
talking
about.
Then,
determine
the
amount
of
water
supplied
through
this
system,
how
much
amount
of
water ,
which
we
estimated
by
using
the
Penman
Monteith
equation
or
FAO56
equation.
So,
here,
we
will
be
estimating
what
is
the
amount
of
water
which
was
used
when
we
are
giving
water
through
drip
system
and
when
we
are
giving
through
conventional
system.But,
what
happened?
When
we
are
giving
water
through
drip
system
here,
we
are
not
flooding
the
entire
or
we
are
not
wetting
the
entire
area
allocated
to
each
plant.
So,
wetting
is
the
wetting
factor
or
wetting
made
by
the
dripper
is
considered
while
we
are
giving
water
through
drip
system.
So,
it
is
in
case
of
horticultural
fruit
crops,
this
value
it
is
bearing
from
30%
to
60%
or
0.3
to
0.6
or
0.65
maximum
it
is
taken.
But,
in
case
of
close
growing
crop,
it
varies
from
0.65.
That
is
at
initial
stage.
And,
it
goes
up
to
100%.
Sometimes,
we
take
90%.
So,
that
value
is
used
to
find
out
the
total
water
requirement.
The
procedure
has
already
been
stated in previous class.
So,
we
will
be
finding
out
that
what
is
the,
because
we
are
we
have
conducted
experiments.
So,
we
find
out
what
is
the
yield
under
drip
system.
And
also,
with
the
conventional
system,
then,
we
will
find
out
the
prevailing
market
selling
price.
So,
whatever
the
drip
means
response
which
we
are
getting
we
multiply
and
we
will
find
out
what
is
the
total
value.
Means,
we
will
find
out,
how
much
is
the
total
income
which
we
are
getting.
Only
thing
here
one
can
see
the
quality
of
produce
which
can
be
also
it
will
aid
because
quality
of
produce
done
by
the
drip
system.
Here,
we
are
giving
appropriate
quantity
of
water .
We
are
giving
fertilizers.
So,
that
way
the
quality
of
produce
is
better .
And
then,
selling
price
will
be
different.
But,
for
the
comparison
purpose,
we
are
taking
the
same
selling
price
here.
So,
then
what
we
will
do,
we
will
find
out
the
net
seasonal
income.
Means,
we
will
subtract
the
drip
system
and
conventional
system.
That
is
the
item
7
minus
3
that
3
is
your
total
seasonal
cost.
Total
seasonal cost is subtracted from the total net income.
Now ,
estimating
the
additional
area
when
we
are
giving
water
through
drip
system,
we
are
saving
considerable
amount
of
water .
So,
that
saving
in
the
water
if
it
is
used
for
cultivation
that
has
been
calculated
and
then
if
we
are
considering
the
same
selling
price
and
the
additional
produce
which
we
are
getting
that
can
be
utilized.
So,
additional
income
due
to
the
additional
area
that
can
be
found
out
and
the
additional
net
income
can
be
found
out.
So,
we
will
find
out
the
gross
cost
of
the
production.
We
will
find
out
the
gross
income.
And,
we
will
work
out
the
Benefit
Cost
Ratio.
So,
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
due
to
drip,
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
due
to
conventional
irrigation
system,
we
can
also
find
out,
how
much
is
the
net
profit
when
permillimeter
of
water?
Because,
we
have
already
used
drip
systems
so,
per
millimeter
of
water .
And
then,
determine
the
yield
per
millimeter
of
water
used.
So,
this
is
a
water
use
efficiency
term that can be also estimated.
So,
this
is
one
example
which
has
been
reported
by
A
S
Rao.
And,
it
is
given
in
the
particular
manual.
The
study
data
collected
from
Maharashtra
and
in
case
of
the
Pomegranate
field
that
particular
thing,
it
is
given.
If
the
Pomegranate
it
is
cultivated
then
cost
of
the
drip
system
involved
is
18,000
rupees.
Life
is
considered
as
a
5
years.
So,
this
is
a
low
life
is
given.
But,
it
can
be
of
more
life
also.
So,
the
annual
cost
will
come
down
considerably .
So,
this
is
depreciation
3,600
and
then
considering
the
bank
interest
rate,
it
is
estimated
repair
maintenance,
this
is
1%
which
I
told
you.
So,
that
way
it
will
be
calculated
and
total
cost
is
obtained.
Now ,
total
cost
of
cultivation
has
been
worked
out
and
then
amount
of
water
which
has
been
given.
Whereas,
when
we
are
taking
conventional
system,
this
particular
part
is
nil
in
case
of
conventional
irrigation
system.
And
then,
the
cost
of
cultivation,
it
is
in
case
of
drip
because
it
is
using
the
soluble
fertilizer
some
of
the
more
components.
So,
this
is
also
more
than
the
conventional
system.
Water
used
by
the
crop
because
we
are
using
the
drip
system.
So,
it
is
785 millimeter . Here, it is 1,440.
Yield,
it
is
109
into
10
is
to
power
3.
This
is
75.
So,
this
is
the
actual
field
data
recorded
based
on
the
interview
done
or
the
experimental
studies
carried
out
in
Maharashtra.
And
then,
selling
price
also
it
is
very
low
price.
It
has
been
given.
Means,
it
is
old
data.
So,
this
is
1000
rupee
means
1
rupee
per
piece.
This
is
for
just
example
we
are
giving
it.
You
can
see
here
the
how
the
income
is
estimated.
So,
income
is
from
the
produce
is
item
4,
5
that
yield
multiplied
by
the
selling
price
this
means
giving
the
income.
And
then,
this
is
for
the
income
due
to
conventional irrigation system.
Now ,
net
seasonal
income
it
has
been
estimated.
So,
there
is
a
difference
you
are
getting.
And
then,
additional
area
due
to
saving
in
water .
So,
here
0.8
because
this
is
the
saving
in
water
we
are
bringing.
So,
that
way,
all
these
components
which
I
explained
in
the
steps
these
are
here,
explained
here
also.
And,
we
can
see
here
that
net
extra
income
due
to
implementationof
the
drip
system.
It
is
coming
1,
40,628
from
1
hectare
area.
So,
net
profit
per
millimeter
of
water
used
is
110.14.
This
is
a
10.42.
Water
use
efficiency
is
also
very
high
as
compared
to
the
other
methods.
So,
this
is
you
can
see
that
how
this
is
giving
response.
And,
main
thing
is
that
you
can
see
here
Benefit
Cost
Ratio.
So,
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
is
4.84
when
we
are
using
drip
system.
This
is
2.2.
So,
this
way,
it
is
shows
that
when
somebody
is
using
drip
system
for
cultivation of Pomegranate crop, one can derive this benefit.
Similar
studies
has
been
carried
out
at
IIT
Kharagpur
with
the
support
from
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Farmers
Welfare
through
the
project.
So,
we
carried
out
work
for
Banana
crop,
Guava
crop
and
Pineapple,
Mango,
Sapota.
So,
these
are
the
fruit
crops.
And,
you
can
see
here
the,
these
are
the
actual
results
we
got
from
our
study .
Much
better
results
afterword’ s,
these
are
not
very
high
yield.
But,
whatever
yield
we
have
got,
we
are
just
showing
you
here
how
the
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
it
is
giving
on
water
use
efficiency .
So,
this
you
can
see.
There
is
a
considerable
improvement
in
the
yield
as
well
as
Benefit
Cost
Ratio
when
we are using.
Similarly ,
for
the
Turmeric,
Potato,
Okra,
Tomato,
Cabbage,
and
Capsicum
all
these
are
vegetable
crops.
And
then,
these
studies
have
been
carried
out.
And
then,
for
this,
the
yield,
water
applied,
these
data
are
useful
for
you
people
when
you
are
referring
that
you
can
refer
these
things
that
fixed
cost
water
use
efficiency
and
then
benefit
cost
analysis
has
been
carried
out.
So,
we
can
see
that
these
are
all
the
results
which
based
on
the
long
term
research
work
carried
out
for
more
than
2
decades.
And
then,
these
data
have
been
obtained
based
on
that
such
studies
are
useful
for
taking
up
research
studies,
taking
up
the
trials,
taking
up
such
crop
cultivation
in
the
farmers
field
and
farmers
as
such
they
are
adopting
these
things
based
on the data available.
So,
in
this
lecture,
we
have
covered
the
economic
evaluation
considering
the
soil
moisture
movement.
We
have
discussed
about
the
economic
evaluation
considering
the
planting
geometry .
Means,
1
plant,
2
plant,
3
plant,
4
plants
of
the
Banana
and
optimize
the
length
of
lateral.
Then,
we
also
did
experimental
field
research
work
and
evaluated
the
economics
of
the fruit crops vegetable crops. So, this we did study .In
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
be
working
out
numerical
problem
on
economics
of
micro
irrigation
system

You
can
refer
these
references
which
are
there
quite
a
good
number of references are there, these can be used. Thank you very much.
