Tutorial 10 – Numerical Examples on Solar  PV Irrigation System
Hello
participants
of
micro
irrigation
engineering
subject.
I
am
inviting
you
to
lecture
50
of
this
subject.
Lecture
50,
deals
with
tutorial
10
in
which
we
have
solved
numerical
problems
on
solar
PV
irrigation
system.
In
lecture
48
and
49
we
have
discussed
about
solar
PV
system,
integration
of
solar
PV
system
with
micro
irrigation
pumps
and
then
the
theoretical
aspects
of
this
particular
topic we have discussed in those lectures.
Now
in
this
particular
lecture
we
will
be
dealing
some
of
the
theories
problems
which
are
to
go
more
insight
about
this
particular
topic.
So,
here
we
will
discuss
about
solar
PV
power
output
and design of solar PV  system.
So,
question
1
here
we
are
required
to
determine
cell
temperature,
we
are
required
to
determine
open
circuit
voltage,
we
are
required
to
determine
maximum
power
output
for
150
standard
module
which
has
been
given
under
the
condition
of
1
sun
insolation
and
ambient
temperature
of
30
degree
Celsius.
This
particular
module
has
rating
of
open
circuit
voltage
of
42.8
Volt
which
is
given
by
Voc
means
we
are
in
the
short
form
we
are
telling
as
a
Voc
and
short
circuit
current
it
is
given
as
Isc
of
3.5
Ampere.
The
temperature
coefficient
for
voltage
drop
is
0.37%
per
degree
Celsius,
power
drop
is
0.5%
per
degree
Celsius.
The
module
has
a
nominal
operating
cell
temperature
in
short
form
we
say
NOCT
of
47
degree
Celsius.
So,
we
have
been
given
these
data.
Once
again,
I
am
reading
the
given
data
that
is
nominal
power ,
module
power
that
is
a
Pn
is
150
Watt.
This
particular
observation
is
being
taken
at
the
ambient
temperature
of
30
degree
Celsius,
NOCT
is
47
degree
Celsius,
Voc
is
42.8
Volt,
and
Isc
is
3.5
Ampere.
Standard
solar
insulationvalue
is
also
available
to
us
that
is
1000
Watt
per
square
meter
and
temperature
coefficient
for
the
voltage which we give by the symbol alpha is 0.37% per degree Celsius.
Temperature
coefficient
for
the
power
drop
which
we
give
by
the
symbol
gamma
equal
to
0.5%
per
degree
Celsius.
So,
these
are
the
available
data
from
this
we
have
been
asked
to
determine
cell
temperature,
open
circuit
voltage,
and
maximum
power
output
voltage.
So,
this
is
the
data,
from
these
data,
these
three
parameters
we
will
estimate.
This
estimation
is
done
by
standard
formula and those standard formulas which I read here.
The cell temperature is estimated by using expression that is
𝑇𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙=𝑇𝑎𝑚𝑏+𝑁𝑂𝐶𝑇−20800
(
)×𝐺
So,
these
data
already
I
told
you
that
T
ambient
is
given
NOCT
is
given
and
G
is
given.
So,
we
are
just
simply
substituting
in
this
expression
to
find
out
the
cell
temperature.
So,
when
we
substitute
this
value
T
ambient
as
30
degree
Celsius,
NOCT
is
given
47
degree
Celsius
and
G
is
given as 1000. So, when we substitute, we get cell temperature as 63.75 degree Celsius.
Now
from
the
given
data
we
are
required
to
find
out
what
is
the
new
open
circuit
voltage.
So,
Voc
is
given
for
the
standard
condition.
Now
Voc
we
are
required
to
obtain
by
using
the
expression here.
𝑉𝑂𝐶=𝑉𝑜𝑐×1−α𝑇𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙−25
(
)
[
]
So,
we
have
been
given
in
the
question
Voc,
we
have
been
given
the
value
of
alpha,
T
cell
we
have
just
now
we
have
calculated.
So,
we
are
substituting
to
obtain
new
value
of
open
circuit
voltage.
So,
new
value
of
open
circuit
voltage
is
estimated
by
simply
substituting
these
values
that
is
Voc
is
given
as
42.8
Volt
and
then
alpha
is
given
0.0037
then
Tcell
we
have
estimated
63.75
degree
Celsius.
So,
after
we
substitute,
we
get
new
open
circuit
voltage
as
36.66
Volt.
Then
maximum
power output that is a Pmax is given by𝑃𝑚𝑎𝑥=𝑃𝑛×1−γ𝑇𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙−25
(
)
[
]
so Pn is al also given to us, gamma is also given to us in the question, T cell we have estimated.
So,
Pmax
means
maximum
power
output
is
estimated
by
using
this
expression
and
by
using
this
expression
we
will
substitute
the
values
which
is
given
in
the
question
and
then
we
will
estimate.
So,
what
when
we
are
substituting
Pn
is
given
at
150,
gamma
is
given
at
0.005
so
and
then
this,
we
have
estimated
Tcell
as
a
63.75
degree
Celsius.
So,
we
get
120.93.
So,
we
had
a
value
of
150
now this is reduced.
So,
Pmax
it
is
reduced
because
of
the
Tcell
temperature
of
63.75.
So,
there
is
a
drop
in
the
rated
power
so
this
drop
in
the
rated
power
has
been
estimated
that
is
150
minus
120
divided
by
150.
So,
that
we
will
get
the
significant
drop
of
19%
from
its
rated
power
of
150.
So,
this
way
it
has
been estimated the all three parameters have been estimated.
Now
question
2,
here
we
have
been
given
data
that
a
solar
based
micro
irrigation
system
has
a
PV
array
rated
at
1
kilowatt
under
standard
test
conditions.
So,
means
this
is
the
rated
value
of
one
kilowatt
under
standards
test
condition.
Now
the
PV
array
operates
at
20
degree
Celsius
ambient
temperature.
So,
this
is
the
data
which
is
available
that
ambient
temperature
is
20
degree
Celsius.
The
module
nominal
operating
cell
temperature
that
is
a
NOCT
is
47
degree
Celsius,
DC
power
output
at
the
MPP
drops
by
0.5%
per
degree
Celsius
above
standard
test
condition
at
temperature
of
25
degree
Celsius.
So,
there
is
a
power
drop
by
0.5%
per
degrees
Celsius.
So,
this
information
is
also
given
and
then
PV
system
has
3%
array
loss
due
to
mismatched
modules.
So,
this
value
is
given
that
a
3%
is
the
loss
due
to
mismatching
of
the
modules
and
4%
loss
due
to
deposition of dirt and dust.
So,
this
is
another
value
which
is
available.
Now
inverted
it
operates
at
90%
efficiency .
So,
we
are
required
to
determine
the
output
from
PV
system
in
AC
form
that
is
alternative
current
means
this is given to us we are required to find out AC output from the PV  system.So,
the
PV
array
power
is
1
kilowatt
is
given,
ambient
temperature
is
given,
20
degree
Celsius
and
NOCT
is
given
47
degree
Celsius,
standard
insolation
power
it
is
falling
on
the
panel
that
is
1000
Watt
per
square
meter ,
temperature
coefficient
drop
is
0.5%
per
degree
Celsius.
So,
same
formula which we used in previous question 1, so this we are using here also.
𝑇𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙=𝑇𝑎𝑚𝑏+𝑁𝑂𝐶𝑇−20800
(
)×𝐺
So,
we
have
been
given
T
ambient
and
is
20
degree
Celsius.
So,
we
are
substituting
here
NOCT
is
given
that
is
a
47
degree
Celsius
and
this
is
the
standard
formula
minus
20
divided
by
100
multiplied
by
G,
G
is
given
as
a
1000.
So,
we
are
substituting
and
we
get
the
cell
temperature
as
53.75 degree Celsius.
Now
with
the
power
loss
at
0.5
degree
Celsius
per
degree
above
25
degree
Celsius,
this
is
the
important
information.
The
DC
rated
power
of
the
array
would
be
estimated
as
Pdc
that
is
the
power rated from your DC rated power is given by
𝑃𝑑𝑐= 𝑃𝑛×1−γ𝑇𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙−25
(
)
[
]
So,
we
will
use
this
expression
to
obtain
the
value
of
Pdc.
So,
just
simply
we
are
substituting
the
value.
We
have
been
given
Pn
as
1
kilowatt
then
we
have
estimated
T
cell
as
53.75
this
value
of
gamma
is
also
available
that
is
0.005
that
is
0.5%
per
degree
Celsius.
So,
0.005
we
are
substituting
here
and
25
it
is
in
the
formula.
So,
after
substituting
this
value
we
are
getting
Pdc
that
is
your
DC
rated
power
of
array ,
so
this
is
0.856
kilowatt.
Now
including
mismatch
factor
means
this
also
information
is
given
to
us
mismatch
factor
we
have
been
given
the
delt
factor
is
also
given
to
us.
We
have
been
given
the
inverter
efficiency .
So,
we
will
substitute
to
get
the
value
of
AC
power
output
estimated
in
the
previous
system.
So,
Pac
that
is
a
power
output
in
terms
of
AC
power
output we can say that is equal
𝑃𝑎𝑐=𝑃𝑑𝑐×𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 ×𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑡 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 × 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑠
So, we have got Pdc at 0.856 multiplied by the mismatch factor because 3% it is given.So,
we
will
get
this
particular
factor
means
in
terms
of
the
coefficient.
So,
this
is
coming
as
0.97
and
then
the
delta
factor
that
is
4%.
So,
this
value
will
be
in
the
terms
of
the
coefficient
this
is
we
are
getting
as
0.96
multiplied
by
the
inverted
efficiency
of
0.90.
So,
the
AC
power
output
Pac
equal to 0.717 kilowatt is the answer .
Now
coming
to
question
3.
In
question
3,
we
have
been
given
information
that
the
I-V
characteristic
of
a
PV
module
at
standard
test
condition
is
shown
in
the
figure
given
below .
This
is
the
figure
which
we
have
been
given.
So,
current
and
voltage
characteristics
of
PV
module
is
given
in
this
figure.
We
are
required
to
determine
fill
factor
and
also
it
has
been
asked
that
how
much will be the ef ficiency of PV  module if it has a surface area of 1 square meter .
So,
this
is
the
diagram
which
is
available
this
diagram
has
been
given
in
the
next
page
also.
So,
I
am
just
putting
here
to
explain
you
more
from
this
diagram.
So,
from
this
diagram
or
figure
what
we
are
seeing
that
when
this
particular
graph
has
been
plotted
between
the
current
I
and
voltage
V.
So,
what
we
see
this
particular
data
when
it
is
plotted,
we
find
that
Isc
is
here
it
is
a
7.5
ampere.
This
is
Isc
that
is
the
short
circuit
current
and
then
we
have
got
the
voltage
Voc
equal
to
21.5.
So,
this
dotted
line
gives
us
the
value
of
Isc
as
well
as
open
circuit
voltage,
we
have
got
these
two
value.
Now
from
this
diagram
we
also
see
that
when
this
is
a
plotted
this
particular
diagram
so
at
this
particular
point
the
maximum
power
is
available
at
120
kilowatt.
So,
this
is
another
value
which
we
are
getting
that
this
is
the
trend
of
the
curve
which
has
changed
from
this.
So,
this
is
the
P
max,
maximum
power
as
120
watt
and
then
standard
solar
insulation
value
is
also
available
that
is
1000
watt
per
square
meter .
So,
from
this
curve
what
we
see
here
at
120
Watt
the
value
of
maximum
current
we
get
that
is
Im
equal
to
7
Ampere.
And
the
corresponding
value
if
you
see
here
corresponding
value
of
Vm
that
is
voltage
so
maximum
voltage
is
17
at
this
point
that
is
a
17
volt.
So,
at
P
120
that
is
a
maximum
power
of
120
Watt
from
this
particular
diagram
Im
is
7
ampere,
Vm
is
17
volt.
Now
fill
factor
has
been
calculated
by
using
these
values
which we have obtained from this I-V  curve. So, fill factor is given by𝐹𝐹= 𝐼𝑚×𝑉𝑚𝐼𝑆𝐶×𝑉𝑂𝐶
So,
all
these
values
are
now
available
to
us
from
this
particular
figure.
So,
we
are
just
simply
substituting 7 multiplied by 17 divided by 7.5 multiplied by 21.5 so fill factor equal to 0.74.
Now ef ficiency of the PV  module is estimated by using this expression
η=(𝐹𝐹×𝐼𝑆𝐶×𝑉𝑂𝐶1000×𝐴)×100
So,
fill
factor
we
have
estimated,
Isc
already
we
have
got
from
the
figure,
Voc
also
we
have
got
from
the
figure
and
A
is
given
to
us.
So,
A
is
given
as
1
square
meter .
So,
just
simply
we
are
substituting
the
values
that
is
FF
that
is
a
fill
factor
is
0.74
for
we
have
estimated
Isc
is
7.5,
Voc
is
21.5.
So,
multiplication
of
these
values
that
is
0.74
into
7.5
into
21.5
divided
by
1000
multiplied
by
area
1
so
into
100.
So,
this
is
coming
as
11.9
are
12%.
So,
efficiency
of
the
PV
module is 12%.
Now
question
4,
we
have
been
given
data
that
a
pump
is
required
to
deliver
water
100
cubic
meter
per
day
from
a
well
having
average
static
water
level
of
20
meter .
So,
we
are
required
to
deliver
this
is
the
demand
that
is
100
cubic
meter
per
day
the
demand
and
a
well
which
is
given
where
static
water
level
is
20
meter .
A
drip
irrigation
system
is
installed
to
irrigate
2.5
hectare
orchard.
So,
area
is
given
to
us
as
2.5
hectare.
Total
head
loss
from
major
and
minor
components
of
drip
irrigation
system
is
6
meter .
So,
head
loss
is
major
head
loss,
it
is
frictional
head
loss
and
minor
head
loss
due
to
connector ’s,
fittings
and
couplers.
So,
this
all
those
losses
which
are
occurring
because
of
these
connections
are
minor
head
loss.
So,
some
of
these
two
losses
is
equal
to
6
meter
this
is
available
to
us.
The
operating
pressure
required
to
operate
drip
emitter
is
1
kg
per square centimetre.
So,
this
is
the
head
requirement
that
should
be
available
then
our
dripper
will
operate.
So,
1
kg
per
square
centimetre
equal
to
10
meter
of
water
column.
From
manufacturer ’s
catalogue,
a
PV
module
of
320
Watt
power
capacity
is
selected.
So,
this
information
is
available
that
oneparticular
PV
module
which
is
delivering
320
Watt
that
particular
module
has
been
selected
which has maximum current and voltage rating of 8.74 Ampere and 36.61 Volt, respectively .
So,
current
is
8.74
Ampere,
voltage
is
36.61
Volt.
The
submersible
pump
has
voltage
rating
of
420
Volt
for
the
head
up
to
50
meter .
So,
up
to
50
meter
this
much
voltage
rating
it
is
available.
Now
we
are
required
to
determine
there
are
three
components
which
has
been
asked
in
this
question.
We
are
required
to
determine
the
pump
capacity
assuming
overall
pump
efficiency
and
inverter
efficiency
as
60%.
So,
pump
efficiency
is
60%
and
inverter
efficiency
as
95%.
Second
part
of
the
question
it
has
been
asked
the
size
of
solar
PV
system
required
to
fulfil
the
water
demand
if
the
location
has
average
daily
4.5
hour
one
insulation
per
insulation
means
one
insulation
it
is
delivering
in
every
day
4.5
hours
sunshine
is
available.
This
is
another
data
and
the derating factor is 20%.
So,
the
derating
factor
is
available.
4.5
hours
solar
insolation
at
the
standards
standard
was
insolation
of
1000
that
is
a
4.5
hour
it
is
available
and
we
have
been
given
information
is
60%
is
the pump ef ficiency and 95% is the inverter ef ficiency .
These
data
once
again
it
is
given
here
and
just
to
make
you
understand
we
have
been
given
the
daily
requirement
of
the
pump
is
100
cubic
meter
per
day,
static
water
level
hs
is
20
meter ,
the
heat
loss
due
to
friction
and
minor
losses
in
including
both
the
losses,
it
is
6
meter ,
the
operating
pressure
to
operate
the
dripper
is
10
meter ,
maximum
current
that
is
Im
is
8.74
Ampere,
maximum
voltage
Vm
is
36.61
Volt.
Maximum
power
that
is
a
Pmax
available
from
the
panel
which
has
been
selected
that
is
a
320
Watt
and
then
the
number
of
hours
in
a
standard
insulation
is
4.5
hours
per
day.
This
is
also
available
efficiency
of
the
pump
is
60%,
inverter
efficiency
is
95%
and
derating
factor
is
20%.
So,
having
given
these
data
our
aim
is
to
this
much
amount
of
water so production goal that is water production goal is 100 cubic meter per day .
So,
required
pumping
rate
is
estimated
by
Q
equal
to
daily
demand
that
is
100
cubic
meter
per
day
divided
by
hours
of
insulation
that
is
given
to
us
that
is
a
4.5
hours
and
that
is
multiplying
factor .
So,
when
we
are
substituting
this
value,
we
get
required
pumping
rate
equal
to
100divided
by
4.5
that
is
your
hours
of
insulation
and
multiplied
by
60.
So,
when
we
divide
this
4.5
into
60
so
we
get
0.37
cubic
meter
per
minute
or
we
can
say
6.17
litre
per
second
is
the
required
pumping rate which is equivalent to 100 cubic meter per day , this is the demand.
Total
dynamic
head,
we
will
estimate,
we
have
been
given
static
water
head,
we
have
been
given
major
and
minor
head
losses,
we
have
been
given
the
operating
head
of
the
emitter .
So,
all
these
things
when
we
are
summing
means
total
dynamic
head
Ht
is
equal
to
20
meter
plus
6
meter
plus
10
meter
equal
to
36
meter .
The
pump
capacity
in
kilowatt
we
will
be
estimating
by
using
the
expression
𝑃𝑢𝑚𝑝 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑘𝑊()=9.81×𝐻𝑡 (𝑚)×𝑄(𝐿𝑠−1) 𝑝𝑢𝑚𝑝 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦×𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦×1000
So,
when
we
get
this
when
we
substitute
the
value
9.81
multiplied
by
the
total
Ht
that
is
total
dynamic
head
is
36
meter
this
we
have
calculated
and
then
the
dischar ge
in
litre
per
second
which
we
calculated
6.17
litre
per
second.
Pump
efficiency
is
60%
the
inverter
efficiency
is
95%
multiplied by 1000 to get the value in kilowatt.
So,
we
are
getting
3.82
kilowatt
which
is
when
we
are
dividing
with
the
0.746
because
746
Watt
equal
to
1
horsepower .
So,
when
we
are
getting
it
that
is
3.82
divided
by
0.746
and
kilowatt
so
this becomes your 5.12 horsepower . So, this is the answer .
Now number of PV  panel when we want to estimate in series. So, this can be given by
𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠= 𝐷𝐶 𝑃𝑢𝑚𝑝 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 (𝑉)𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 (𝑉)
So,
module
in
series,
we
are
given
that
is
420
pump
voltage.
Now
when
we
want
to
convert
AC
voltage
from
the
DC
point
of
view
so
DC
voltage
is
when
multiplied
by
square
root
2.
So,
this
we
are
multiplying
with
the
square
root
2
so
420
multiplied
by
root
2
divided
by
36.61.
So,
we
get
16.22
are
17
number
of
panels.
So,
modules
in
series
is
17
numbers.
Now
number
of
module
string in parallel, it is estimated by using the expression
𝑃𝑉 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑙= 𝑃𝑢𝑚𝑝 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 (𝑊) 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠×𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑉()×𝑀𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑒 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐴()×𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟So,
pump
input
voltage
we
have
already
estimated,
number
of
module
in
series
already
we
have
got
17
number .
Module
voltage
is
available
to
us,
module
current
is
also
available
to
us
and
then
the rating factor is also available to us.
So,
when
we
are
estimating
it,
we
have
got
the
values
at
3820
kilowatt
divided
by
17
into
36.61
into
8.74
multiplied
by
derating
factor .
So,
the
derating
factor
is
1
minus
0.2.
So,
we
get
here
0.88,
which
is
nothing
but
1
so
one
module
is
in
parallel.
So,
the
PV
system
capacity
is
estimated
by
module
in
series
multiplied
by
module
in
parallel
multiplied
by
module
power
capacity .
So,
this
can
be
given
simply
we
have
got
17
into
1
into
320
is
the
capacity
of
a
single
module.
So,
this
is
coming
at
5440
Watt
which
is
equivalent
to
5.40
kilowatt.
So,
hence
17
number
of
PV
panels
of
320
Watt
power
capacity
is
sufficient
to
deliver
desired
pump
power
requirement
of
3.82 kilowatt. So, this is our answer and this is the interpretation of this particular question.
So,
we
estimated
these
things
and
now
to
get
more
insight
more
experience
you
are
solving
problems,
so
you
may
refer
these
books
for
more
details.
Let
me
summarize
the
whole
thing.
In
this
lecture
we
discussed
about
power
from
solar
PV
module,
we
also
estimated
operating
cell
temperature,
fill
factor
and
how
to
estimate
the
efficiency
of
PV
module.
And
then
pump
and
PV
system
design
also
has
been
estimated
in
the
last
question.
In
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
discuss about automation of micro irrigation system part one. Thank you very much.
