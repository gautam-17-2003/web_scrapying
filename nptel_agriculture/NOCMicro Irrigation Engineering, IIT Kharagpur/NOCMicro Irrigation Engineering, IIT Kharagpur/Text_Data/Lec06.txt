Evapotranspiration
Hello
everybody .
Welcome
to
lecture
6,
Evapotranspiration.
Lecture
6,
is
very
important
for
irrigation
subjects
not
only
for
micro-irrigation
but
when
we
deal
with
irrigation
engineering
or
even
drainage
engineering.
Evapotranspiration
plays
an
important
role
and
let
us
try
to
learn
evapotranspiration.
What
are
the
different
processes
which
are
involved
in
evapotranspiration?
So,
here
are
our
basic
topics
which
we
will
discuss
in
evapotranspiration.
What
are
the
different
terminologies
which
are
used
and
then
in
this
lecture,
we
will
also
deal
with
factors
which
influence
evapotranspiration
processes,
and
then
there
are
various
ways
to
estimating
evapotranspiration?
So,
one
of
the
approaches
is
the
Water
Balance
approach.
So,
we
will
deal
with
all
these
concepts
in this particular lecture.
Now ,
when
we
come
to
the
hydrologic
cycle,
if
we
look
at
the
hydrologic
cycle
you
can
see
here
the
precipitation
is
the
input
component
of
the
hydrologic
cycle.
When
precipitation
in
the
form
of
rainfall
or
snow
or
any
other
form
where
it
takes
place,
it
falls
on
the
ground
or
on
vegetation,
and
then
part
of
this
water
is
intercepted
by
the
vegetation,
plant
foliage,
and
then
it
comes
on
the
ground surface.
So,
when
it
is
falling
on
the
ground
surface,
there
is
one
particular
process
which
is
a
very
important
process
known
as
infiltration.
So,
infiltration
takes
place
and
when
the
infiltration
goes
for
a
longer
period
then
this
water
goes
to
percolation,
and
then
that
causes
a
rise
in
the
water
table.
Now ,
in
infiltration,
when
the
precipitation
or
rainfall
is
more
than
the
infiltration
rate
of
soil some part of the rain will generate as surface runof f.And
when
it
goes
there
it
appears
as
a
spring
or
it
appears
as
a
base
flow
above
the
ground
surface.
So,
surface
runof f
appearing
as
spring
appearing
as
various
other
processes,
and
then
it
becomes
a
water
body .
The
other
part
of
the
hydrologic
cycle
is
evaporation.
So,
part
of
the
water
which
is
available
above
the
ground
surface,
on
the
land
surface,
or
over
the
water
body ,
got evaporates and condenses.
Condenses,
it
forms
a
water
vapor ,
it
forms
cloud
then
condensation
takes
place
again
it
is
the
process
and
then
from
the
plant
body
with
from
the
leaf
foliage,
what
we
see
transpiration
takes
place.
So,
evapotranspiration,
when
we
see
it
as
one
of
the
major
components
of
hydrologic
cycle
that
affect
crop
water
demand
and
quantification
of
evapotranspiration,
is
important
from
an irrigation planning point of view , irrigation design point of view .
Now ,
evapotranspiration
here
there
are
two
terms
involved.
One
is
Evaporation
and
the
other
one
is
Transpiration.
What
is
the
Evaporation?
It
is
the
process
by
which
water
is
lost
to
the
atmosphere
in
the
form
of
vapor
from
natural
surfaces,
such
as
free
water ,
bare
land,
or
from
live
or
dead
vegetation.
Transpiration
is
another
component
of
evapotranspiration
and
it
is
the
process by which water is lost in the form of vapor through plant leaves.
So,
when
we
say
evapotranspiration,
it
is
a
combined
loss
of
water
from
soil
or
the
plant
surface
and
also
transpiration
that
is
a
plant
transpiration
surface
to
the
atmosphere
through
vaporization
of liquid water .
So,
these
two
terminologies,
this
the
effect
in
the
evapotranspiration
means,
they
are
combined
terms
are
evapotranspiration.
Now ,
left
side
of
the
figure,
if
we
see
the
transpiration
is
taking
place
from
vegetation
from
the
leaves
of
the
plant.
Evaporation
is
taking
place
from
this
while
from the bare soil and temperature and humidity are influencing the water flowing.
The
precipitation
it
occurs
causes
the
increase
in
the
soil
moisture
content
that
water
which
is
stored
in
the
soil
pores
that
is
available
for
the
plant
to
transpire
evapotranspiration
takes
place.So,
here
on
this
particular
left
side
of
the
figure,
you
will
see
the
evapotranspiration
both
the
components
are
shown.
There
are
vegetations,
in
the
vegetation
when
you
see
the
leaves
which
are contributing to transpiration process, soil which is contributing to evaporation.
So,
bare
land,
water
surfaces
are
responsible
for
the
evaporation
process.
Water
that
is
stored
in
the
soil
is
available
soil
water .
So,
evaporation
takes
place
from
the
water
available
in
the
soil
that
is
available
soil
water
and
then
transpiration
takes
place
through
the
process
when
the
water
is
taken
by
the
root
uptake.
Now ,
when
we
see
any
plant
which
is
now
growing
from
sowing
to
the harvesting stage, the leaf area index means ground cover increasing by the plant foliage.
Accordingly ,
the
transpiration
process
or
component
of
the
transpiration
is
increasing
and
as
the
ground
cover
or
leaf
area
index
of
the
ground
is
increasing.
The
soil
evaporations
say
the
contribution
of
evaporation
from
the
soil
surface
is
decreasing
and
this
is
the
trend
which
we
see.
But
its
combined
effect
of
this
evaporation
and
transpiration
is
crop
evapotranspiration.
So,
when
the crop is small or we can say its height is less.
The
water
is
predominantly
lost
by
soil
evaporation
that
is
what
is
explained
in
this
particular
right
side
of
the
diagram.
But
once
the
crop
is
well-developed
means
it
is
completely
covering
the
soil,
transpiration
becomes
the
main
process.
So,
evapotranspiration
rate
is
normally
expressed
in
millimeters
per
unit
time,
we
express
in
millimeters
per
day
or
when
we
make
it
weekly .
So,
this
can
be
weekly
evapotranspiration,
how
much
so,
we
use
this
value
in
millimeters
per
day.
In
a
week
time,
how
much
evapotranspiration
is
computed
that
is
used
for
the
design
of
the
irrigation
system.
Now ,
there
is
various
terminology
which
we
use
in
evapotranspiration.
So,
one
terminology
is
potential
evapotranspiration.
As
the
term,
it
said
that
potential
evapotranspiration
means
the
evapotranspiration
that
occurs
when
the
ground
is
completely
covered
by
actively
growing vegetation where there is no shortage of soil moisture.PET
concept,
means
potential
evapotranspiration
concept
was
introduced
by
Thornthwaite
as
earlier
as
in
1948.
And
he
established
an
expression
where
potential
evapotranspiration
is
directly
related
to
the
temperature
of
a
particular
place.
Consumptive
use
is
another
terminology
that
is
used
in
evapotranspiration.
So,
CU
we
call
as
a
consumptive
use
in
a
short
form
and
it
is
the loss due to evapotranspiration water that is used for its metabolic activity .
The
CU
value,
exceed
by
evapotranspiration
by
the
amount
of
water
used
for
digestion,
photosynthesis,
transport
of
minerals,
and
photosynthates.
Its
structural
support
of
the
plant
and
overall
total
growth
of
the
plant.
This
difference
between
ET
and
CU
is
just
a
difference
of
1%.
So,
ET
and
CU
are
used
means
synonymously
or
one
can
use
CU
or
ET
both
the
terms
are
used
simultaneously .
And
there
is
another
term
that
is
used
as
a
Reference
Evapotranspiration
and
symbol
wise
it
is
a
standard
symbol,
we
denote
it
ET
o
or
ET
zero.
So,
it
is
the
potential
evapotranspiration
for
a
specific
crop
usually ,
it
is
grass
or
alfalfa
and
set
of
surrounding
advective
conditions.
Reference
crop
evapotranspiration
from
an
extensive
surface
of
green
grass
of
a
uniform
height
of
12
centimeters.
It
is
actively
growing,
it
is
completely
shading
the
ground,
with
an
albedo
of
0.23,
and
having
ample
water
supply
is
called
reference
crop
evapotranspiration.
And
it
is
the
modified
term
because
there
were
some
other
investigators,
also
gave
that
is
Wright,
Doorenbose,
and
Pruitt,
Allen
has
brought
this
terminology
in
1998
where
he
standardize
the
crop
height
as
12
centimeters. Other investigators/researchers have given dif ferent values of crop height.
But
in
all
these
cases
they
are
it
has
been
advocated
that
it
is
fully
covering
the
ground
that
is
one
case,
the
second
one
there
is
no
limitation
of
soil
moisture
content.
So,
this
reference
evaporates
it
provides
evaporative
demand
of
atmosphere
independent
of
the
type
of
crop,
growth
the
stage,
and management practices which is being followed.Now ,
the
other
part
which
is
used
in
evapotranspiration
means
other
terminologies
which
are
used
here
that
is
crop
evapotranspiration.
We
call
it
actual
crop
evapotranspiration.
This
means
it
is
the
evaporation
of
the
crop
under
standard
conditions.
The
standard
conditions
here
mean,
what
is
the
moisture
content
available
in
the
soil?
How
is
the
ground
cover
it
is
there?
And
then
what are the soil as well as management conditions? Which are there.
So,
a
standard
condition
means
the
crop
is
disease-free
means
it
is
fully
active
and
then
it
is
well
fertilized.
This
is
the
important
part
that
it
is
disease-free
and
well
fertilized.
So,
that
the
rate
of
withdrawal
of
water
from
soil
moisture,
it
is
adequately
being
taken
out
and
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration
requirement.
Optimal
soil
moisture
content
and
then
it
is
producing
its
growth, biometric growth and all that and then optimum production.
So,
from
a
foliage
point
of
view
production
can
suppose
it
is
a
leafy
vegetable.
So,
optimum
production
means
it
is
giving
optimum
yield
or
the
optimum
number
of
leaves
from
the
grain
point
of
view
and
it
is
having
the
optimum
production
that
could
be
another
way
of
expressing
optimum
production.
Now ,
adjusted
crop
evapotranspiration,
crop
evapotranspiration
for
the
different
management,
environmental
condition,
pest
disease,
low
fertile
soil,
soil
moisture
stress, etc.
So,
the
value
of
ETc
needs
to
be
adjusted
as
per
the
conditions
that
exist
in
the
field.
Now ,
this
particular
right-side
diagram
which
you
see
here
the
climate
means,
basically
it
is
influencing.
So,
the
atmosphere
practically
provides
energy
for
withdrawing
the
water .
So,
the
atmosphere
when
we
talk
about
it
involves
climate
means,
what
are
the
radiation
characteristics?
How
much
is the longwave radiation?
What
is
the
intensity
of
radiation?
And
this
radiation
causes
an
increase
or
decrease
in
the
temperature,
wind
speed,
direction
of
the
wind,
humidity
that
influence
and
then
grass
reference
crop.
So,
crop
where
it
is
grown
in
your
well
water
crop,
and
then
what
is
this
particular
grass?
Itis
Alfalfa
or
green
grass.
So,
whatever
amount
of
water
is
used
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration is called reference evapotranspiration which you see is given by ET
0
.
Now ,
this
reference
evapotranspiration
when
we
are
multiplying
with
the
crop
coefficient
or
K
c
factor
which
is
your
crop
coefficient
factor
or
K
c
factor
with
ETo
then
it
comes
to
ET
c
.
That
is
the actual crop evapotranspiration, ET
c
.
So,
what
are
the
different
factors
which
influence
evapotranspiration?
In
this
particular
slide,
these
particular
factors
are
explained.
So,
energy
for
vaporization
is
a
latent
heat
that
is
influenced
by
solar
radiation.
What
is
solar
radiation?
It
is
available
at
what
intensity
solar
radiation it is falling which is an important part. And then what is the temperature?
More
will
be
the
solar
radiation
higher
will
this
is
directly
responsible
for
higher
temperature
and
then
there
will
be
high
evapotranspiration.
Then
vapor
transport
from
the
evaporative
surface.
What
is
the
wind
speed?
And
from
which
direction
wind
is
blowing?
So,
and
then
what
is
the
humidity
of
atmospheric
humidity
in
the
surrounding
where
the
crop
is
being
grown?
So,
transport
of
the
water
vapor
from
one
place
to
another
place
will
take
place
depending
on
the
wind speed.
And
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
that
is
also
influencing
the
evapotranspiration
magnitude
of
the
evapotranspiration
value.
Vegetated
surface,
what
is
the
type
of
the
crop
which
is
being
grown?
What
is
the
routing
system?
And
how
much
is
the
soil
moisture
content?
And
how
it
is
covering?
So,
these
also
influence
and
then
the
intensity
of
solar
radiation
which
is
falling
on
the
vegetative
surface
its
albedo
as
well
as
emissivity .
This
also
causes
the
value
of
evapotranspiration.
So,
just
now,
when
I
was
telling
you
about
vegetation,
it
influences
evapotranspiration.
So,
what
is
the
type
of
crop?
What
is
the
variety
of
crops?
Any
crop
it
is
passing
through
different
developmental
stages.
So,
one
is
your
initial
stage
and
another
one
is
the
crop
development
stage.The
third
one
is
the
crop
maturity
stage
or
crop
late-season
stage.
So,
these
four
stages
influence
the value of crop evapotranspiration.
So,
here
when
we
talk
of
crop
type,
it
will
be
you
know
crop
type,
what
is
the
architecture
of
the
crop?
What
is
the
height
of
the
crop?
And
how
does
it
influence
the
aerodynamic
resistance
of
the
canopy
and
to
latent
or
sensible
heat
flux?
A
taller
crop
with
a
more
dense
crop
has
got
higher
water
use
rate
for
similar
surface
resistance.
So,
means
higher
height
crop
has
got
more
crop water intake.
Leaf
Area
Index,
the
amount
of
plant
when
we
call
up
about
the
leaf
area
index
so,
amount
of
plant
foliage
exposed
to
direct
solar
irradiance
and
amount
of
shaded
plant
foliage
expose
to
transmitted
and
reflected
diffuse
solar
radiation.
So,
means
more
the
leaf
area
index
more
will
be
the
evapotranspiration.
So,
LAI
which
is
a
leaf
area
index
3
to
4
sufficient
to
maximize
transpiration and fully shading the ground.
Crop
Roughness,
the
type
of
vegetation
cover
is
a
roughness
rooting
characteristic
this
also
influences
the
evapotranspiration
process.
The
particular
type
of
crop,
what
type
of
photosynthesis pathways in plant species af fect the evapotranspiration.
So,
these
are
some
of
the
crop
bases.
Now ,
we
can
see
here
how
evapotranspiration
takes
place.
So,
water
available
in
the
soil
pores
are
being
extracted
by
the
root
system
it
goes
to
the
stem,
and
from
the
stem,
it
comes
to
the
plant
canopy ,
and
then
transpiration
takes
place.
And
then
what
are
the
type
of
management
practices
whether
there
is
a
lot
of
grasses
also
along
with
the
main crop.
So,
that
will
be
also
affecting
the
soil,
and
then
what
is
the
soil
moisture
available.
So,
if
the
different
types
of
practices
are
being
maintained.
So,
evapotranspiration
of
the
crop
depending
on
the
soil
moisture
condition
depending
on
the
particular
pest
or
disease
are
tagged
in
the
plantthat
needs
to
be
adjusted.
So,
practically
if
there
is
you
know
without
crop
and
then
it
is
taken
or
if it is fully covering vegetation.
So,
that
is
your
ETo,
now
ETo
multiplied
by
Kc
we
will
give
you
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop
and
when
it
is
having
limited
soil
moisture
content
are
due
to
some
or
other
problem
insect pests disease then ET c is going to be af fected and that value of ET c need to be adjusted.
Now
evapotranspiration
is
a
very
important
process
and
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view ,
it
needs
to
be
determined
and
this
needs
to
be
determined
or
then
this
can
be
measured
directly
or
it
can
be
estimated.
So,
if
it
is
to
be
determined
directly
there
are
methods.
So,
one
is
by
using
a
lysimetric
method
or
lysimeter .
The
other
one
is
by
using
field
experiments
by
using
soil
moisture depletion studies or by using the water balance approach.
An
indirect
way
of
measurement
or
estimation
can
be
solely
temperature
based
it
can
be
using
the
energy
balance
or
radiation-based
it
can
be
by
using
the
temperature
as
well
as
other
climatic
parameters.
So,
the
combined
approach
can
be
estimated
by
using
a
pan
evaporimeter
that
can
be
used.
The
pan
evaporimeter
values
can
also
be
used
to
determine
the
evapotranspiration
requirement of the crop.
Direct
measurements
methods
are
time-consuming.
These
are
expensive
but
this
gives
a
relatively
precise
estimate
and
that
is
normally
advocated
provided
one
has
adequate
facility
to
determine the direct evapotranspiration measurement.
Now ,
in
this
particular
slide,
you
can
see
here
a
concept
of
conservation
of
mass
principle
has
been
used
to
determine
evapotranspiration
of
the
crop.
So,
practically
before
I
come
to
this
particular slide, let me just show you the next slide, and then I will come back to this slide.
So,
here
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
mass
which
we
are
putting
that
inflow ,
outflow
and
change
in
the
inflow
minus
outflow
is
a
change
in
the
soil
water
storage
or
soil
moisture
content.So,
inflow
minus
outflow
is
the
concept
that
has
been
used
in
the
conservation
of
mass
principle.
So,
what
are
the
inflow
component?
Inflow
component
is
your
irrigation,
P
is
precipitation,
precipitation
can
be
rainfall
when
we
are
considering
due
to
surface
inflow
of
water
that
is
surface inflow means, your water entering into the control volume.
There
is
a
lateral
inflow
means
below
the
soil
that
inflow
is
taking
place
in
the
lateral
direction.
There
is
a
contribution
of
groundwater
that
is
a
capillary
rise
because
of
the
high
water
table.
The
outflow
component
is
the
runof f
component.
Lateral
outflow
means
water
is
going
out
of
the
control
volume;
L
is
the
water
that
is
used
for
leaching
purposes
for
leaching
of
salts.
DP
the
deep percolation means water which is going deep;
Because
when
the
water
is
continuing
giving
irrigation.
So,
some
part
of
the
water
goes
beyond
the
root
zone
depth
that
is
a
deep
percolation
and
there
is
another
component
that
is
being
withdrawn
which
we
are
talking
about
evapotranspiration.
So,
inflow
minus
outflow
is
a
change
in the soil moisture content, which is given by
∆𝑆=𝐷𝑟𝑧θ𝑓−θ𝑖
(
)=𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 −𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤
Where
change
in
soil
moisture
content
(
)
,
refers
to
the
final
moisture
content,
refers
to∆𝑆θ𝑓θ𝑖
the initial moisture content, and D
rz
is the depth
of root zone.
Now ,
coming
back
to
the
previous
slide
which
is
shown
here
that
means
a
system
which
we
are
taking
now,
this
system
is
basically
a
soil
system
in
which
we
are
considering
a
control
volume.
Control
volume
means
it
is
where
we
are
considering
our
study
area.
And
in
this
study
area,
your
boundary
is
defined.
Now ,
in
this
boundary
we
are
taking
different
in
the
direction
arrows
are
particularly showing; what is the input component what is the output components.
𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤=𝐼+𝑃+𝑆𝐹𝐼+𝐿𝐼+𝐺𝑊
So,
inflow
you
can
see
here
I
that
is
irrigation,
then
P
is
another
input
component,
LI
is
another
component.
P
is
precipitation,
I
is
irrigation
LI
is
the
lateral
inflow
to
into
the
control
volume.
So,
water
which
is
coming
this
is
your
sub-surface
flow
means
soil
moisture
is
transporting
fromthe
adjoining
area
to
the
study
region
and
then
the
groundwater ,
groundwater
because
of
the
high-water table.
So,
there
is
a
capillary
movement
or
water
table
is
contributing
to
the
soil
build-up
of
this
soil
moisture
content.
Now ,
another
component
is
SFI,
SFI
is
the
surface
flow
into
the
control
volume.
So,
there
is
some
kind
of
runof f
that
is
coming
from
the
adjacent
land
into
the
control
volume
in
your
study
region.
Now ,
the
outflow
component
when
we
are
looking
so,
outflow
component is given by
𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤=𝑅𝑂+𝐿𝑂+𝐿+𝐷𝑃+𝐸𝑇 
So,
LO
is
your
lateral
outflow .
There
is
another
outflow
component
is
the
deep
percolation
(DP)
water
which
is
being
come
from
the
inflow
and
that
is
causing
so,
it
is
going
beyond
the
root
zone
depth
r
which
is
used
for
leaching
of
the
salt
(L)
and
another
is
runof f
(RO)
which
is
water
going out of the control volume. Now , when we balance these components.
And
these
components
are
so,
after
balancing,
we
get
evapotranspiration.
And
this
particular
system
is
considered
in
the
effective
root
zone
depth.
So,
your
control
surface
or
control
volume
is
considered
in
the
effective
root
zone
depth.
So,
when
we
are
making
balance
means,
if
we
can
maintain
means
measure
all
these
components,
then
we
can
get
the
balance
in
terms
of
evapotranspiration which is given as
)𝐸𝑇=𝐼+𝑃+𝑆𝐹𝐼+𝐿𝐼+𝐺𝑊−𝑅𝑂−𝐿𝑂−𝐿−𝐷𝑃−𝐷𝑟𝑧(θ𝑓−θ𝑖
So,
on
this
concept,
a
lysimeter
is
used
where
various
components
which
are
inflow
and
outflow ,
can
be
measured.
So,
the
last
lysimeter
is
a
device
that
is
installed
in
a
crop
field
for
which
we
were
interested
to
determine
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
So,
there
will
be
two
lysimeters,
one
lysimeter
where
you
are
maintaining
exactly
the
ideal
condition.
There
is
no
shortage
of
water
you
are
maintaining,
you
are
growing
Alfalfa
or
green
grass
than
the
actual
crop which is being grown in the field this we are growing.So,
you
are
measuring
water
loss.
Loss
means
the
water
which
is
used
by
the
plant
for
evapotranspiration
or
gain
when
we
take
coming
to
mean
something
which
has
been
added
by
precipitation
it
has
come
from
the
adjoining
area.
So,
soil
and
crop
conditions
in
the
lysimeters
are
kept
the
same
as
surrounding
field
conditions.
This
measurement
involved
which
could
be
weighing or non-weighing type of L ysimeter .
We
are
putting
a
scale
or
floating
the
Lysimeter
in
water
by
water
is
suitable
heavy
liquid
in
which
the
lysimeter
can
float.
And
any
change
in
that
liquid
is
computed
against
water
loss
or
water
gain
that
will
depend
you
know
initially
the
first
day
when
you
are
adding
that
will
be
gain. But at the end of 24 hours you find there is a loss, those loss components are found out.
So,
if
the
crop
is
of
shorter
height
means
or
short
duration,
then
the
Lysimeter
is
of
the
smaller
size
it
is
used
and
it
said
volume
will
be
less
than
is
a
two
cubic
meter .
And
then
if
tall
crop
like
sugarcane
or
any
other
crops,
which
are
taller
than
the
Lysimeter
could
be
a
larger
size
it
could
be mean so, 3 to 4 cubic meter and the depth can be also increased.
Now ,
a
typical
Lysimeter
concept
it
is
being
shown
here
the
Lysimeter
which
has
been
you
know
installed
in
the
field
and
the
crop
is
grown.
The
adjacent
area
there
are
in
the
same
crop
is
grown
and
then
the
irrigation
or
rainfall
it
is
occurring
and
then
it
is
building
soil
moisture
content.
When
the
soil
moisture
content
goes
more
than
the
saturation
then
it
will
cause
deep
percolation
it will go as drainage.
It
may
also
in
the
rain,
rainfall
is
very
high
then
it
will
form
runof f
and
then
part
of
the
water
which
is
going
as
evapotranspiration.
Now ,
these
components
can
be
measured
by
using
non-weighing
type
Lysimeter
or
weighing
type
Lysimeter .
In
a
non-weighing
type
of
lysimeter ,
we
are
measuring
different
components
of
soil
moisture
content
by
using
several
devices
and
though
the
change
in
the
soil
moisture
values
is
used
as
an
evapotranspiration
value
means,
the
loss in the soil moisture content is measured.So,
this
is
what
you
are
seeing
this
can
be
you
know
there
is
a
metal
or
plastic
membrane
which
is
kept
driven
into
the
soil
and
then
a
permanent
device
or
access
tube
or
neutron
probe
you
know ,
soil
moisture
measuring
gadgets
are
installed
in
the
Lysimeter
where
the
change
in
the
soil
moisture
content
is
measured.
When
we
are
talking
about
weighing
type
Lysimeter
this
particular
device is flow means kept over a load cell.
Now ,
load
cell,
displacement
in
the
load
cell
is
measured
by
using
the
scale
or
in
terms
of
weight.
That
load
cells
are
you
know
we
are
measuring
in
the
strain
gauges.
What
is
the
displacement
in
a
given?
So,
these
things
are
measured
and
then
the
amount
of
water
which
is
transpired
are
in
different
components,
which
I
explained
to
you
in
the
previous
slide
those
are
monitored and then it is the evapotranspiration is measured by using.
So,
water
is
applied
in
a
given
quantity
means
the
amount
of
water
is
measured;
measured
quantity
of
water
is
applied
which
call
it
irrigation
and
it
is
in
the
same
amount
as
in
the
surrounding
area
overflow
and
deep
percolation
if
it
occurs,
those
are
also
measured
means
all
the
component
rather
I
will
say
these
are
measured.
So,
water
received
through
irrigation,
precipitation,
excluding
overflow
that
is
a
runof f
we
can
say
the
deep
percolation,
the
balanced
soil moisture content.
So,
water
constitutes
means,
the
water
used
by
the
crop
in
the
process
of
evapotranspiration
is
balanced
are
measured.
So,
just
now,
I
have
shown
you
that
the
two
types
apply
and
then,
of
course,
Lysimeter
is
a
device
which
is
measuring
the
evapotranspiration
giving
precise
estimate
but
there
is
a
certain
limitation
here
also
that
reproduction
of
actual
field
condition.
It
becomes
difficult
and
one
is
getting
the
ideal
water
table
condition
that
exists
in
the
Lysimeter
if
it
is
closed from the bottom.
So,
as
well
as
certain
field
conditions
mean
the
natural
density
of
the
soil
which
is
existing
in
the
field,
as
well
as
you
know
the
soil,
maintaining
soil
texture,
becomes
a
difficult
task,
but
overtime
when
we
are
conducting
an
experiment
for
a
long
time
it
maintains
the
same
kind
of
condition as outside.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
discussed
evapotranspiration,
evaporation,
and
what
are
the
different
climatic
as
well
as
vegetative
factors
which
influence
the
evapotranspiration
process.
We
also
explained
about
how
to
determine
evapotranspiration
by
using
the
lysimeter .
There
are
other
methods
of
estimating
evapotranspiration
as
well
as
determining
measuring
soil
moisture
content
and
then
depletion
of
the
soil
moisture
content
that
will
be
discussed
in
the
forthcoming
lecture.
So,
this
will
be
discussing.
