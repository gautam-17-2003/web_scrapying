Performance Evaluation of Sprinkler  Irrigation System
Hello,
participants.
I
invite
you
to
Lecture
42
of
the
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
course.
Lecture
42
is
on
the
performance
evaluation
of
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system
component.
System
component
here,
one
of
the
components
which
I
am
considering
is
the
sprinkler
head.
Any
system
or
particularly
with
respect
to
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
we
are
interested
to
evaluate
its
performance.
So,
that
system
can
be
installed
and
it
can
work
as
per
the
desired
capacity .
So,
this
particular
component
whether
it
is
working
satisfactorily
and
this
is
one
aspect
to
evaluate
satisfactory
working
of
sprinkler
component.
Another
one
is
to
design
the
system
as
it
is
behaving,
as
it
is
performing
in
the
field.
Accordingly ,
operating
pressures,
the
spacing
between
the
sprinklers,
and
the
application
rate
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle
can
be
decided
and
it
can be operated.
So,
mainly
in
this
particular
topic,
we
are
going
to
cover
the
evaluation
of
sprinkler
parameters.
And
we
will
work
out
the
data
collected
from
the
field.
How
the
various
evaluation parameter , performance parameters it can be estimated?
When
we
talk
of
the
performance
of
a
sprinkler
nozzle,
so,
sprinkler
nozzle
when
we
say
nozzle
is
evaluated
for
its
application
rate
and
its
suitability
with
respect
to
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil.
So,
primary
factors
are
important
parameters
we
can
say
which
influence
its
operation.
One
is
operating
pressure
and
another
one
is
nozzle
geometry .
These
2
are
the
important factors that af fect the water application rate.
When
we
say,
how
much
is
the
dischar ge
which
is
coming
out
of
the
sprinkler
that
will
depend
upon
the
operating
pressure.
Nozzle
geometry ,
I
mean
to
say
what
is
the
diameter
of
the
nozzle
opening?
What
is
the
shape?
Whether
it
is
a
circular
shape?
Whether
it
is
arectangular
shape
nozzle?
Or,
it
is
a
square
shape
nozzle.
So,
water
emer ging
out
of
the
sprinkler nozzle is going to be influenced by the shape of the nozzle opening.
And
then
angle,
at
what
angle
of
throw ,
the
jet
which
is
emer ging
out
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle
at
what
angle
it
is
emer ging.
So,
how
the
particular
nozzle
angle
is
fixed
at
the
time
of
manufacturing?
Now ,
the
parameters
which
are
evaluated
for
any
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
it
is
evaluated
based
on
the,
what
is
the
dischar ge
from
a
sprinkler?
How
much
distance
it
is
throwing?
How
the
sprinkler
nozzle
it
is
distributing
the
jet
when
it
is
getting
broken?
And
then
how
its
movement
takes
place.
How
the
distribution
takes
place?
What
is
the
size
of
the
droplet?
How
much
is
the
application
rate
for
a
given
pressure?
And
then,
we
want
to
evaluate,
how
uniform
water
it
has
been
sprinkling
or
distributing
out
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle.
So,
how
it
is
uniformly
distributing
the
water
droplets
which
are
falling?
So,
there
is
one
specific
index
which has been prepared that is uniformity coef ficient.
Dischar ge
from
a
sprinkler
is
a
function
of
the
diameter
of
the
nozzle
and
operating
pressure.
These
2
are
the
important
thing
and
C
is
the
coefficient
of
a
dischar ge.
The
dischar ge
from
a
sprinkler
nozzle,
normally
the
sprinkler
nozzle
geometry
is
circular
in
shape
and
looks
like
an
orifice
and
therefore
it
is
orifice
flow.
So,
the
value
of
x
is
approximately
equal
to
0.5,
i,
which
here
it
is
given
that
is
the
number
of
sprinkler
nozzles
or
sprinkler
head
that
i
varies
from 1 to n.
So, total dischar ge from a system is estimated by using this expression
Where
K
is
the
constant
that
depends
on
how
many
number
of
sprinklers
it
has
been
used.
And
of
course,
they,
another
one
is
that
what
is
the
unit
which
we
are
giving?
Say
we
are
putting
it
in
centimeter
or
millimeter
or
we
are
putting
here
it
is
also
in
kilopascal.
So,
according
to
the
unit,
the
value
of
K
will
change.
And
also
the
dischar ge
can
be
expressed
in
meter cube per second, liter per second. Normally , these 2 units we are using.
This
is
one
particular
company's
pressure
dischar ge
relationship.
So,
when
we
are
giving
pressure
from
a
sprinkler
nozzle,
which
is
expressed
in
pound
per
square
inch.
And
these
are
the
2
diameters.
One
diameter
is
for
the
range
nozzle.
The
diameter
of
the
range
nozzle
is
3
by
32
inch.
And
6
by
64,
6
by
64
is
for
the
spreader
nozzle.
So,
particularly
this
nozzle,
there
are
I
mean
there
are
twin
nozzle
system
and
this
twin
nozzle
when
suppose
it
is
operating
at
25
psi.
That
is
25
pounds
per
square
inch.
It
will
deliver
a
1.2
gallon
per
minute
dischar ge.
So,
like
this
for
different
pressure
the
dischar ge
table,
it
is
supplied
by
the
manufacturer .
It
is
available. Or else, one can calculate the value of the dischar ge.
Now ,
the
distance
of
throw ,
this
is
one
parameter
which
I
told
the
distance
of
throw
it
governs
the
spacing
between
the
adjacent
sprinkler
means
a
distance
of
throw
will
depend
upon
the
pressure.
More
the
pressure
more
will
be
the
distance
of
throw .
So,
we
want
to
have
better
or
uniform coverage of this sprinkler jet that is coming out of this.
So,
we
will
decide
what
should
be
the
spacing
between
the
sprinkler
nozzles
along
the
main
as
well
as
along
the
lateral.
So,
that
way
it
is
decided.
Normally ,
this
distance
of
the
throw
is
published
by
the
manufacturer .
And
manufacturer
gives
the
leaflet
where
operating
pressure,
what
is
the
diameter
of
the
nozzle
for
a
given
diameter ,
how
much
is
the
distance
of
throw
for
different operating pressures and nozzle sizes,  so, that information is available.
Distribution
pattern,
how
the
water
is
being
distributed.
So,
the
distribution
pattern
will
depend
upon
the
operating
pressure,
nozzle
geometry ,
wind
speed,
etcetera.
There
are
several
things
that
are
influencing
the
distribution
pattern.
A
wide
range
of
droplets
caused
by
the
higher
operating
pressure
results
in
a
triangular
shape
distribution
pattern
in
which
the
depth
of
application
increases
linearly
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
pattern
towards
the
sprinkler .
Varying
nozzle
means
nozzle
angle
affects
the
pattern
that
is
a
wetted
area
and
then
means
the pattern shape.
Now ,
here
what
we
are
seeing
is
the
distribution
pattern.
I
was
telling
you
that
when
there
are
different
operating
pressures
and
when
the
pressure
applied
is
low,
you
see
here
that
the
sprinkler
is
at
this
particular
point
and
then
water
is
distributed.
So,
in
some
places,
it
is
more,larger
depth
and
then
immediately
adjacent
to
the
sprinkler ,
0
refers
to
the
sprinkler
head
is
at
this
place.
And
then,
either
side
of
the
sprinkler
means
it
is
on
either
side
what
you
find
that
the
water
is
being
distributed
by
the
sprinkler
head
which
is
located
here.
And
in
this
side
as
well
as
this
side
you
find
symmetry .
So,
water
distribution
here
the
depth
of
water
is
more.
It
is
low.
So,
this
is
why
it
is
so
because
of
the
low
pressure.
When
optimum
pressure
is
given
or
ideal
pressure
is
maintained,
you
will
find
this
is
a
typical
water
distribution
pattern
from
a
sprinkler .
So,
more
is
the
depth
of
water
at
the
center
or
where
the
sprinkler
nozzle
is
available
because
the
spreader
nozzle
is
distributing
more
amount
of
water
nearer
to
the
sprinkler .
And
as
we
go
further
from
the
sprinkler
on
either
side.
So,
we
find
that
this
depth
of
water
is
less.
It
is
reducing.
But
this
is
ideal
and
we
are
required
to
give
appropriate
overlap
so
that
the
uniform
depth
of
water
can
be
maintained.
Here,
in
this
case,
when
the
pressure
is
very
high
you
find
that
this
type
of
shape
it
maintains.
So,
the
distribution
of
water ,
ideal
distribution
of
water
is
this one when the optimum pressure is maintained.
Droplet
size
is
also
influenced
by
the
operating
pressure.
And
it
affects
when
the
droplet
size
is
large,
what
happens,
it
causes
the
impact
on
the
ground
surface
means
water
droplets
that
resemble
like
rainfall.
When
the
droplet
size
is
more,
what
will
happen,
it
will
restrict
or
will
make
the
formation
of
the
seal.
So,
it
will
have
a
sealing
effect.
And
that
will
cause
higher
runof f,
as
well
as,
soil
erosion
will
take
place.
So,
nozzle
opening
shape
and
operating
pressure is going to af fect the droplet size as compared to the nozzle angle.
Application
rate
from
a
sprinkler
nozzle,
it
should
be
such
that,
it
does
not
form
runof f.
It
should
be
less
than
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil.
The
average
application
rate
of
an
individual sprinkler is given by
ùêº=360√óùëÑùê¥
Where,
I = rate of water application (cm h
-1
)
Q  = sprinkler dischar ge (L  s
-1
)
A   = wetted area of sprinkler (m
2
)If
we
are
expressing
Q
in
liter
per
second
and
area
wetted
by
any
sprinkler
it
is
in
a
square
meter ,
then
we
need
to
multiply
with
360
to
take
care
of
the
unit
constant.
When
there
are
several
identical
sprinklers,
they
are
placed
in
a
field,
and
then
the
sprinklers
could
be
a
square
pattern.
It
could
be
a
rectangular
pattern.
That
L
suppose
is
larger
than
the
S
then
it
is
going to be the rectangular pattern. If L  is equal to S then it becomes a square pattern.
Now ,
application
rate
when
there
are
several
identical
sprinklers
are
in
operation
then
one
can
find out, what is the application rate? So,
ùêº=360√óùëÑùêø√óùëÜ
What
is
L?
L
is
the
distance
between
the
sprinklers
along
the
lateral.
S
is
the
distance
between
the
sprinklers
along
the
main.
So,
the
application
rate
is
estimated
like
this.
The
higher
the
application
rate,
the
more
will
be
the
runof f.
Poor
water
distribution
and
loss
of
water are going to take place.
The
other
important
parameter
of
evaluation
is
the
uniformity
coefficient.
It
is
an
index
to
measure
the
uniform
depth
of
water
application.
And
it
is
affected
by
what
is
the
pressure,
what
is
the
size
of
the
nozzle,
and
what
is
the
spacing
between
the
sprinkler
it
has
been
kept?
And,
whether
there
is
an
ideal
wind
condition
calm
wind
condition
exist?
Or,
if
there
is
more
wind
speed.
So,
it
may
cause
the
drift.
Wind
may
cause
the
drift
in
the
water
distribution
pattern.
So,
we
need
to
take
care
while
we
are
deciding
the
spacing
between
the
sprinklers
depending
upon
the
application
rate,
depending
on
the
operating
pressure.
So,
that
is
going
to
make the dif ference in the value of the uniformity coef ficient.
Now ,
in
order
to
estimate
the
uniformity
coefficient,
it
is
the
Christiansen
in
1942,
gave
this
expression
and
this
expression
is
still
valid.
So,
this
is
an
important
parameter
to
evaluate
the
sprinkler uniformity coef ficient. What is the sprinkler uniformity coef ficient? It is given by
Where,
m= average value of all observations
n=total number of observation points
X= numerical deviation of individual observations from the average application rate
So,
we
will
say
suppose
we
have
got
15
number
of
sprinkler
depth
observations.
So,
what
we
will
find
out
from
the
15
depths
of
sprinkler
observation
that
has
been
collected,
we
will
first
find
out
the
numerical
average,
the
arithmetic
average
of
these
values.
So,
15
values,
the
sum
of
the
depth
divided
by
the
number
of
observations
will
give
you
the
average
value
of
all
the
observations.
Now ,
from
there,
actually
whatever
average
we
have
got,
so
individual
values,
so,
xi
that
is
x1
minus
m
will
be
the
one
value
that
is
one
deviation.
Then
another
deviation
will
be
xi.
That
is
x2
minus
m,
x3
minus
1,
like
this
you
know
x15
minus
m.
And
then
we
will
take
the
difference
values.
Sum
of
deviations
of
that
value.
And
then
that
is
taken
as
an
absolute
value.
So,
those
sums
are
will
be
used
to
find
out
the
numerical
deviation.
And
that
is
divided
by
m
into
n.
If
we
find
from
the
observation
it
is
equal
to
85%
or
more
than
85%,
it
is
considered
satisfactory .
And
if
it
is
more
than
90%,
then
it
comes
under
very
good
performance.
Now ,
the
various
parameters
which
are
used
to
evaluate
sprinkler
system
that
for
a
given
operating pressure, what is the dischar ge coming out of the sprinkler? So, this is given by
Q = C. a.
‚àö
2gh
What
is
C?
C
is
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge
which
is
a
function
of
friction
as
well
as
contraction
losses.
Small
a
is
the
area
of
cross-section
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle.
If
it
is
circular
then
we
can
simply
write
pi
d
square
by
4;
h
is
the
operating
pressure.
If
you
are
expressing
everything
in
meter
means
a,
you
are
expressing
in
square
meter
and
then
if
you
are
putting
h
in meter then the corresponding dischar ge will be in meter cube per second.
Now ,
the
water
spread
area
of
the
sprinkler .
So,
when
a
sprinkler
is
being
operated.
So,
once
it is operated it gets this stable value. One needs to find out, what is the radius of coverage?
So,
this
radius
of
coverage,
this
particular
radius
of
coverage
is
wetted
area.
This
is
R.
That
is
given by capital R. And so, the water spread area of the sprinkler is given byA = 
œÄ
R
2
Now ,
this
R
is
nothing
but
the
radius
of
the
wetted
area
that
has
been
given
by
Cavazza
and
Pillsbury
1986.
They
have
got
an
empirical
relationship
and
that
empirical
relationship
has
been used.
R = 1.35
‚àö
dh
Where d is the diameter of the sprinkler nozzle.
Now ,
another
parameter
one
can
evaluate
is
the
break-up
jet
index.
Break-up
jet
index,
basically
it
is
giving
that
at
a
given
operating
pressure
when
the
sprinkler
nozzle,
the
particular
jet
it
appears,
so
it
hits
on
the
arm,
and
that
hitting
on
the
swing
arm
which
deflects.
So,
it
guides
the
water
to
flow
through
that
is
smooth.
But
it
hits
and
that
starts
the
break-up jet droplets. So, those droplets, break-up jet is evaluated by this expression.
P
d
= h / (10q)
0.4
Where
h
is
the
operating
pressure,
q
is
the
dischar ge
in
liter
per
second.
So,
this
Q
is
a
capital
Q
which
is
expressed
in
cubic
meter
per
second.
Here,
this
q
is
also
in
the
dischar ge
form.
And then it is given by liter per second.
Now ,
the
values
of
Pd
because
h
if
you
know
and
q
you
know ,
then
you
can
find
out,
what
is
the
Pd?
Now ,
if
Pd
that
is
a
break
up
by
jet
index
is
given
by
Pd
if
it
is
greater
than
2
that
condition
of
the
drop
size
is
good
means
it
is
acceptable.
It
is
good.
If
it
is
a
Pd
equal
to
4,
the
condition
of
the
droplet
size
is
best.
And
then
if
the
Pd
is
greater
than
4,
then
pressure
is
being
wasted.
Means
electricity
or
any
energy
which
we
are
using
for
operating
the
sprinkler ,
we
are
wasting
the
energy
because
the
operating
pressure
it
is
at
the
higher
side.
The
other
part of the evaluation is the uniformity of application.
ùê∂ùë¢=100{1.0‚àí‚àëùëã
ùëö√óùëõ}
So, this part already I have told you.
Now ,
we
will
demonstrate
to
you
how
the
observations,
parameters
which
I
have
told
how
they
are
to
be
determined,
how
to
find
out
the
emission
uniformity ,
how
the
data
should
be
collected?
So,
I
am
just
giving
you
an
experimental
procedure
and
then
we
will
operate
onesprinkler
head
in
the
field
that
you
will
also
study
and
learn
from
that.
We
want
to
perform
an
evaluation
test
so,
a
sprinkler
system
should
be
installed
at
a
desired
location
in
the
field.
Note
down
the
specification
of
the
pump
coupled
with
the
electric
motor .
Observation
on
the
wind
means
that
is
a
climatic
observation
we
need
to
collect
for
taking
the
observation.
With
respect
to
a
sprinkler
system,
and
we
want
to
find
out,
what
is
the
capacity
of
the
sprinkler
system? What is the dischar ge of the sprinkler system? So, we need to conduct the test.
So,
first
of
all,
we
will
be
dividing
the
whole
field
into
square
grids
and
then
at
the
center
of
each
grid,
one
plastic
can
will
be
kept.
And
then
what
happened,
normally ,
these
cans
should
be
placed
2
meter
apart
for
a
smaller
spacing
in
emitters
or
drippers
or
sprinklers
whatever
we
say.
So,
means
for
a
smaller
set
that
is
2
meter
apart
it
should
be
done
when
the
spacing
is
10 meter apart. 3 meter when we are putting it is for the lar ger spacing sprinklers.
Means
when
we
are
bought
a
larger
farm
area
then
we
want
to
operate
all
the
sprinklers
at
a
stretch.
In
that
case,
such
provision
should
be
there
if
it
is
for
a
larger
spacing.
The
grid
should
cover
the
entire
area
of
the
sprinkler
area,
theoretically ,
it
should
be.
Otherwise,
if
there
is
no
wind
condition
exist,
this
is
done
for
the
entire
area.
When
there
is
wind
or
some
kind
of
field
is
going
means
the
data
are
going
to
be
affected.
So,
it
can
be
also
done
that
we
are
taking
half
or
one-quarter
of
the
field.
One-quarter
of
the
circular
field
because
the
sprinkler
rotates.
So,
it
makes
one
particular
circle
that
is
360
degree.
Now ,
if
you
are
putting
a particular angle that is up to 90 degree, up to 180 degree we should evaluate.
So,
the
procedure,
it
remains
the
same.
Process
procedure
will
remain
the
same.
Types
of
the
data
will
remain
the
same.
Only
thing
you
will
be
getting
the
number
of
observations
will
be
different.
The
number
of
observations
will
be
half.
Why
we
can
do
in
the
half.
We
assume
that
it
is
in
the
ideal
condition.
So,
whatever
data
we
are
collecting
such
data
will
be
replicated in the other side. The can grid should be covered the entire area.
We
will
note
down
the
observation
of
the
range
as
well
as
the
sprinkler
nozzle
as
their
sizes,
operating
pressure,
and
then
corresponding
dischar ges.
That
relationship
already
you
have
studied
that
Q
is
equal
to
C
into
a
into
root
2gh.
So,
the
operating
pressure
and
dischar ge
relationship
is
required.
Pressure
is
measured
by
using
a
pressure
gauge
which
is
fixed
on
theriser
pipeline,
or,
using
a
Pitot
tube
also
these
data
are
collected.
That
is
the
pressure
and
dischar ge data can be collected.
Now ,
dischar ge
is
measured
by
connecting
the
physical
tube
on
both
the
nozzles
which
are
sprinklers
major
range
nozzle,
as
well
as,
the
sprinklers
spreader
nozzle.
So,
this
data
which
we
are
collecting
with
the
help
of
a
tube,
the
dischar ge
is
collected
in
a
can
and
then
for
a
given
period,
we
will
convert
the
dischar ge
means
precipitation
intensity
form
that
how
much
is
the
amount
of
water
it
has
come
out.
So,
either
we
can
say
in
the
volumetric
form
or
in
the
depth-wise
form
also
it
can
be
converted.
And
then
one
can
know ,
what
is
the
precipitation
intensity?
Like
this,
we
will
collect
the
observation
on
radius
and
water
spread
area.
Then
we
will
repeat
the
observation
for
the
different
pressures
to
achieve
desired
uniformity
coefficient
of
85%
or
more.
So,
we
need
to
operate
for
the
other
pressure
till
we
are
not
getting the coef ficient of uniformity more than 85%.
Now ,
these
are
the
observations
that
we
will
be
collecting.
The
observations
on
the
pressure
of
the
water
at
the
nozzle,
the
dischar ge
of
a
smaller
nozzle,
dischar ge
from
the
large
nozzle,
the
diameter
of
small
nozzle,
diameter
of
a
large
nozzle.
These
diameters
are
used
to
calculate
the
dischar ge
from
the
smaller
nozzle
as
well
as
the
larger
nozzle.
So,
this
is
a
measurement
we
have
done.
Wind
speed
is
measured
by
using
the
anemometer
and
then
wind
direction.
So,
we
will
note
down,
what
is
the
wind
direction?
And
then,
the
temperature,
what
is
the
ambient
temperature?
Relative
humidity ,
pump
size
in
hp,
what
is
the
inlet
diameter
of
the
pump?
What
is
the
outlet
diameter
of
the
pump?
The
dischar ge
from
the
pump,
all
these
data
are useful. And this can be given.
So,
like
this
for
serial
number
one
means
basically
it
is
the
row
and
column.
At
the
center
of,
these
row
and
column
that
particular
location,
one
Can
can
be
kept
and
observation
can
be
obtained.
So,
O1,
O2,
O3
are
the
lines
on
where
the
cans
are
placed.
And
O
is
the
center
of
the
sprinkler
over
which
the
sprinkler
head
is
kept.
So,
after
getting
those
data
as
I
told
you
that
we
will
find
out
the
xi
minus
x
bar,
sum
of
xi
minus
x
bar
that
though
so,
this
sum
will
come total of all the values and then one can calculate, what is the emission uniformity?Now ,
we
are
conducting
a
test
in
the
field.
Here,
we
are
demonstrating
to
you
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
So,
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
also
uses
a
pump
which
creates
an
adequate
amount
of
pressure.
So,
water
is
being
lifted
from
the
source
since
it
is
a
demonstration
unit
and
used
for
testing
a
sprinkler
nozzle.
So,
here
it
is
a
small
tank
where
the water is stored. And then there is a pump. You can see here at this place there is a pump.
And
this
pump
is
coupled
with
an
electric
motor .
Now ,
at
the
suction
end
of
the
pump,
there
is
a
flexible
pipeline
where
the
water
is
being
taken.
At
the
lower
end
of
the
pipeline
of
the
suction
pipeline,
there
is
a
foot
valve.
So,
the
foot
valve,
the
purpose
of
the
foot
valve
is
to
retain
water .
So,
first
the
suction
pipeline
it
is
filled
up
with
water
up
to
the
filling
the
impeller so that it does not take the air .
Whatever
air
is
available
in
the
pipeline,
will
be
removed
when
it
is
filled
up
with
water
and
then
water
means
it
is
used
for
priming.
So,
a
foot
valve
you
can
see
here
at
this
end,
there
is
a
flap
it
has
come
out.
And
when
we
are
filling
water
then
this
particular
valve
it
gets
closed
this
is
the
purpose
of
foot
valve.
Then
the
water
is
taken.
This
is
the
delivery
end
of
the
pump
which
is
connected
and
then
it
goes
to
the
main
pipeline
and
at
the
appropriate
location,
sprinklers
are
attached.
We
have
taken
water
from
the
delivery
end
of
the
pipeline.
So,
the
main
pipeline
of
adequate
diameter ,
normally ,
these
pipelines
are
of
2
inch,
2
and
a
half
inch,
or
3
inch
in
diameter .
And
each
pipeline
is
of
3
meter ,
6
meter
or
9
meter
long.
So,
here,
we
have
taken
water
from
the
main
pipeline
and
then
with
the
help
of
a
90-degree
bend,
a
lateral
pipeline has been joined.
Now ,
as
I
told
you
that
there
is
a
coupler
at
an
appropriate
location.
A
coupler
is
used
to
attach
sprinkler
at
a
place
where
we
want
to
give
irrigation.
So,
this
is
one
coupler
in
which
one
lateral
pipeline
will
be
attached
with
another
lateral
pipeline.
And
on
this
coupler ,
you
can
see
here
that
on
the
coupler ,
there
is
a
riser
pipeline
which
is
of
1-inch
diameter ,
1
meter
long,
and
this
end
is
connected
with
a
pressure
gauge.
A
pressure
gauge
is
connected
here
to
know , what is the operating pressure of a sprinkler head?
Now ,
a
sprinkler
head
here
you
are
seeing.
This
is
a
sprinkler
head
which
is
made
up
of
an
alloy
where
there
are
2
nozzles.
These
2
nozzles
are
dischar ging
at
a
given
pressure.
And
onenozzle
is
a
range
nozzle.
Another
this
particular
nozzle
is
a
range
nozzle.
The
other
nozzle
is
the
spreader
nozzle.
This
is
the
counterweight
and
here
there
is
a
spring.
So,
when
the
water
it
comes,
the
spring
compresses
and
then
a
torque
is
created.
So,
because
of
this
torque,
when
the
jet
will
come,
it
will
hit.
So,
once
it
is
hitting,
then
it
deflects.
And
deflection
causes
the
sprinkler head to rotate. So, this way , it takes the ones particular sense circle.
Now ,
we
will
be
monitoring
the
pressure.
At
a
given
pressure,
how
much
is
the
dischar ge
coming
out
of
the
sprinkler?
So,
there
is
a
relationship
which
I
have
already
explained
to
you
that
dischar ge
from
a
sprinkler
nozzle
is
directly
related
with
the
operating
pressure
which
is
the
square
root
of
the
operating
pressure.
So,
we
will
find
out,
what
is
the
total
dischar ge?
Means,
dischar ge
from
this
nozzle
plus
dischar ge
from
this
nozzle,
both
the
nozzles
will
be
operated to know that how much dischar ge we are getting at a given pressure.
From
that
data,
we
will
also
find
out
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge
from
these
2
sprinklers
because
we
know
the
operating
pressure.
We
know
the
dischar ge.
We
know
the
value
of
g.
So,
we
can
find
out
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge.
In
order
to
measure
the
dischar ge
from
both
the
nozzles,
2
pipelines
which
were
fitted
with
the
nozzles.
Now ,
the
total
volume
of
water
is
being
collected
in
10
seconds.
And
then,
we
will
find
out
the
volume
of
water
collected
in
10
seconds will give the dischar ge at 1 kg per square centimeter .
Yes,
this
is
the
dischar ge
from
another
nozzle.
So,
individual
dischar ges
we
have
collected
in
10
seconds,
and
then
using
this
data,
we
will
find
out
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge
for
each
nozzle.
That
is
the
range
nozzle
as
well
as
the
spreader
nozzle.
Now ,
we
can
see
that
in
how
much
time
it
takes
to
take
1
round.
So,
the
sprinkler
revolution
in
per
minute,
it
can
be
found
out.
So,
this
is
one
observation
it
is,
to
be
used.
Another
observation
what
you
see
there
are
measuring
cans.
So,
the
depth
of
water
which
is
collected
in
a
given
time,
these
depths
of
water
will
be
used
to
find
out
the
uniformity
of
water
distribution.
Then
another
observation
which you can see here, what is the diameter of coverage?
So,
a
diameter ,
this
is
the
radius.
It
is
being
measured
that
how
much
is
the
wetting
radius
from
the
nozzle
which
is,
when
the
sprinkler
nozzle,
it
is
operating
at
1
kg
per
square
centimeter .
So,
we
are
measuring
operating
pressure.
We
are
measuring
the
volume
of
waterthen
dischar ge.
Then,
we
are
measuring,
what
is
the
diameter
of
coverage
of
wetting
diameter?
We
are
measuring
the
depth
of
water
collected
in
the
cans.
These
depth
of
water
collected
in
each
can
is
used
to
find
out
the
coefficient
of
uniformity ,
that
formula
which
already I have explained in theory class and we have worked out a problem in the tutorials.
Now ,
this
sprinkler
problem
basically
is
a
numerical
example,
it
has
been
given
where
one
can
evaluate
emission
uniformity ,
one
can
evaluate
pattern
efficiency .
So,
from
one
particular
sprinkler ,
it
is
placed
over
here.
This
is
in
another
corner ,
another
sprinkler
is
placed.
There
is
one
sprinkler
it
has
been
placed
and
at
this.
So,
this
particular
sprinkler
system
is
kept
at
an
appropriate
location.
And
then
at
the
center
of
each
grid,
these
data
have
been
collected.
These
data
can
be
in
milliliter
or
simply
one
can
say
that
these
data
are
in
millimeter
depth
of
water
which
is
collected
in
a
can.
So,
volumetric
form
or
it
can
be
in
the
depth
form,
these
data can be collected.
So,
in
this
particular
problem
sprinkler
heads
which
have
been
used
these
sprinkler
heads
the
one
particular
observation
is
4.365
into
2.381
millimeter .
So,
this
is
one
range
nozzle
diameter .
This
is
the
spreader
nozzle
diameter
which
is
operating
at
2.8
kg
per
square
centimeter .
So,
now
the
area
is
given,
sprinkler
diameter
is
given,
one
can
find
out
what
will
be
the
operating
pressure?
Theoretically ,
what
will
be
the
operating
pressure?
So,
area
one
can
calculate.
We
have
been
given
the
operating
pressure.
So,
Q
is
equal
to
Ca
root
2gh.
The
value
of
C,
it
is
ranging
from
0.95
to
0.98.
So,
you
can
substitute
the
value
and
you
can
find
out how much is the dischar ge at 2.8 kg per centimeter square?
The
other
data
which
are
available,
wind
speed
is
given
3.5
kilometer
per
hour.
And
this
is
from
the
southwest
side
relative
humidity
is
42%.
Test
time
is
1
hour.
So,
these
data
were
collected
from
the
field,
and
from
these
data,
we
want
to
evaluate
the
coefficient
of
uniformity .
So,
these
data
we
have
kept
in
the
descending
order
of
magnitude.
This
means
the
highest
value
is
10.2.
There
is
only
one
observation
of
10.2.
Now ,
you
can
see
9.9
is
another
value.
This
has
also
one,
only
one
time
it
has
occurred.
But,
9.4
millimeter
or
9.4
milliliter
of
water ,it
has
been
obtained
from
2
cans.
So,
like
this,
if
you
see
here,
the
highest
depth
of
water
which is 10.2, and the lowest is 6.6.
And
then
how
many
times
these
observations,
so,
there
were
21
number
of
observations.
And
then,
what
we
are
doing?
We
are
multiplying
with
the
application
rate
multiplied
by
the
frequency .
So,
this
is
the
observation
multiplied
by
the
frequency .
So,
this
means
rather
it
is
the
depth
of
water
application.
So,
the
depth
is
multiplied
by
frequency .
And
then
you
are
summing
the
value
that
is
m
into
n.
m
is
the
average
value
multiplied
by
the
number
of
observations.
So,
the
number
of
observation
is
nothing
but
frequency .
So,
this
value
is
the
depth
of
application
multiplied
by
the
faculty .
So,
m
into
n
equal
to
178.
Numerical
deviation
taking
the
observation,
so,
numerical
deviation
from
the
first
observation
that
is
1.72,
we
will
be
getting
the
value
of
the
frequency
into
deviation.
So,
this
is
coming
as
a
summation
of
X.
That is your deviation from the mean is 17.76.
So,
we
are
getting
the
mean
value.
That
is
m
mean
m
equal
to
the
sum
of
all
the
observations
divided
by
the
number
of
observations.
So,
a
sum
of
all
observation
is
nothing
but
the
previous
value
that
is
your
depth
of
application
multiplied
by
the
frequency
number
of
observations.
So,
this
is
178
divided
by
21
is
8.48
millimeter
or
mL
whatever
the
unit
which
we can use. So, this is the value. And then, we will work out the emission uniformity .
So, emission uniformity is given by
ùê∂ùë¢=100{1.0‚àí‚àëùëã
ùëö √ó ùëõ}
That
is
the
deviation
from
the
mean
summation
value
divided
by
m
into
n.
m
is
the
average
value.
n
is
the
number
of
observations.
So,
when
we
multiply ,
we
get
this
value.
And
then,
we
found
that
the
computed
value
of
Cu
from
the
data
is
90.02%.
It
is
highly
satisfactory .
And
then, this particular setup of the pressure is giving the best performance.
Pattern
efficiency
is
given
by
minimum
depth
divided
by
mean.
So,
minimum
depth,
if
you
remember ,
it
was
6.6
millimeter
and
8.48
is
the
mean.
So,
we
are
getting
77.83%,
which
is
the
pattern
efficiency .
This
is
also
a
very
good
indicator
that
this
particular
sprinkler
systemwhich
we
have
taken
from
the
field
data,
it
is
giving
very
good
performance
from
the
operational point of view .
Now ,
let
us
summarize
this
lecture.
So,
here
we
have
got
evaluated
the
different
parameters
which
are
the
sprinkler
head-dischar ge
relationship.
We
have
evaluated
how
the
water
distribution
takes
place,
water
distribution
in
the
form
of
emission
uniformity .
We
also
worked
out
one
example
to
make
you
more
clearer
about
how
to
find
out
the
uniformity
coefficient, how to find out the pattern ef ficiency .
So,
you
learned
about
this.
And,
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
work
out
numerical
examples
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.

this
particular
topic,

books. So, thank you very much.
