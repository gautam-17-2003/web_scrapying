Bubbler  Irrigation System
Hello,
participants
of
micro
irrigation
engineering
subject.
Now
we
are
starting
lecture
39.
In
lecture
39
we
will
discuss
about
bubbler
irrigation
in
the
family
of
micro
irrigation
emission
devices.
We
discussed
various
types
of
emission
devices
where
drippers
we
discussed,
online,
inline,
point
source,
line
source.
Then
we
discussed
in
the
previous
class
on
micro
sprinklers.
Now ,
this
is
another
type
of
micro
irrigation emission device which is known as a bubbler irrigation system.
So
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
will
discuss
about
what
is
the
importance
of
a
bubbler
irrigation
system,
how
does
it
work,
and
what
are
its
components
and
its
layout,
and
what
are
the
points
which
should
be
considered
while
designing
a
bubbler
irrigation
system.
Bubbler
irrigation
is
a
localized
low-pressure
solid
set
permanent
installation
system
used
in
trees.
The
application
rate
generally
exceeds
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil.
Therefore,
a
bubbler
irrigation
system
is
more
relevant
to
basin
or
furrow
methods
of
irrigation.
They
are
needed
to
control
the
water
distribution
on
the
land.
So either we form a basin or we form furrows.
Water
infiltrates
into
the
soil
and
wets
the
root
zone.
So
here
overland
flow
takes
place
and
then
it
goes
slowly
through
the
infiltration
process
and
then
means
as
in
other
cases
here
the
gravity
component,
a
gravity-flow
component
in
the
porous
medium
is
more
as
compared
to
the
other
kind
of
system,
in
case
of
micro
sprinkler
you have seen or in case of the drip irrigation we have seen.
Although
the
bubbler
application
is
extensively
used
in
the
landscape
irrigation
system
and
its
use
in
agriculture
is
limited.
Because
we
are
talking
of
reducing
thewater
supply .
So
we
want
to
minimize
the
losses.
So
it
is
likely
that
it
may
wet
more
than
the
desired
root
zone
depth.
So
when
the
water
supply
is
not
a
constraint
that
is
one
part
and
then
another
one
is
that
the
quality
of
water
from
the
debris
or
the
sand,
silt
which
is
flowing
with
the
water
that
causes
the
clogging
problem.
From
that
point
of
view ,
this
is
more
important.
So
in
those
situations,
it
is
very
good
and
one
should
go for bubbler irrigation.
Now ,
two
types
of
bubbler
irrigation
systems
are
used.
One
is
of
low
head
or
gravity
type
and
pressurized
system.
So
low
head
or
gravity
system
when
we
say
this
is
limited
to
10
kilo
Pascal
pressure,
whereas
pressurized
we
say,
this
goes
up
to
150
kilo Pascal.
Bubbler
systems
are
well
suited
for
perennial
crops
like
orchards,
vines
because
irrigation
system
typically
includes
buried
pipeline
and
small
earthen
basins
are
made
around
the
particular
plant.
And
bubbler
system
can
also
be
adopted
to
row
crops
that
utilizes
the
furrow .
So
furrows
are
constructed
to
take
water
from
the
bubbler
tube
means to guide the water .
The
bubblers
are
small
plastic
head
emitters.
This
is
what
you
see
these
are
the
small
plastic
head
emitters
and
with
threaded
joints,
means
here
it
is
threaded
joint.
So
it
can
be
connected
with
there
is
another
plastic
stem
which
is
also
threaded.
So
they
were
originally
designed
to
use
on
risers,
above
the
ground
for
flood
irrigation
or
of
small ornamental areas.
But
now
these
are
being
used.
Initially ,
they
were
used
for
such
purposes.
But
now
these
are
used
for
irrigating
fruit
crops.
They
perform
well
under
a
wide
range
of
pressure
delivering
water
in
the
form
of
a
fountain.
This
is
what
it
looks
like
in
the
form
of
a
fountain
or
small
stream
or
tiny
umbrella.
This
is
the
way
you
see
here
in
the vicinity of the emitter .
An
emitter
is
this
particular
device.
So
this
particular
device,
the
way
the
water
is
coming
out
from
this
particular
emission
device.
This
type
of
emission
of
water
isknown
as
a
bubbler
emitter .
They
operate
at
1
to
3
bars
and
then
the
dischar ge
rate
is
100
to
200
liter
per
hour.
These
are
available
at
higher
dischar ge
and
filtration
is
not
required.
This
is
another
beauty
that
the
filter
part
is
eliminated
in
the
case
of
the
bubbler system.
The
potential
advantage
that
compared
with
other
micro
irrigation
systems,
the
bubbler
system
have
some
potential
advantages.
It
requires
low
energy,
maintenance
is
low,
susceptibility
to
the
emitter
clogging
is
low,
water
with
a
higher
suspended
solid
concentration
can
also
be
used,
the
operating
cost
is
low,
the
interval
between
irrigation
is
long,
and
the
short
duration
because
of
the
amount
of
water
or
flow
rate
is
large.
So
irrigation
interval
is
short,
the
irrigation
event
is
short.
Accumulated
salts
are
uniformly leached. Bubbler basins increase the catchment of rainfall.
There
are
some
disadvantages
or
limitations
we
can
say.
Very
few
agricultural
bubbler
system
have
been
installed
or
in
operation.
As
I
told
you
that
it
requires
more
water
and
then
basic
purpose
or
the
main
advantage
of
having
micro
irrigation
system
is
lost
when
we
talk
of
the
giving
water
through
the
bubbler .
Design
criteria
and
recommended operating procedures are not well documented.
This
is
another
thing.
And
then
entrapment
of
air
in
the
pipeline
network
can
lead
to
blockage,
and
then
farm
topography
needs
to
be
level.
This
is
another
important
thing
that
otherwise
water
will
not
guide,
so
because
there
is
overland
flow
takes
place.
Bubblers
are
not
suitable
for
sandy
soil.
The
small
earthen
basins
are
typically
required around the plant so that the water can be guided in a proper way .
Cultural
practices
are
more
difficult
to
perform
around
the
earthen
basin
because
we
are
flooding
the
whole
field.
We
are
giving
the
water
in
larger
point.
So
it
is
likely
there
will
be
more
weed
problems.
So
that
becomes
more
difficult
to
perform
around
the plant.
Now
let
us
come
to
the
system
layout
and
components.
The
bubbler
system
layout
is
typical
among
all
the
pressurized
irrigation
systems.
However ,
some
basic
differencesexist
relating
to
operating
pressure
and
flow
rates.
It
consists
of
a
simple
head
control
unit
without
filters
and
fertilizer
application
operators.
So
fertigation
is
not
done
by
using the bubbler system.
Because
of
the
fertilizer ,
which
we
will
give
the
dissolved
fertilizer ,
it
will
not
only
be
available
to
the
plant
but
it
will
be
flowing
as
overland
flow
to
other
places.
The
mains
and
sub-mains
are
usually
buried
PVC
pipe
hydrants
arising
on
the
surface.
The
manifolds and laterals are also often buried rigid PVC pipes.
The
bubblers
are
placed
above
the
ground
supported
on
a
stake
and
connected
to
the
lateral
with
a
small
flexible
tube
rising
on
the
surface
or
they
can
be
fitted
on
small
dia
PVC
risers
that
are
connected
to
the
buried
laterals.
The
difference
between
the
bubbler
system
and
other
micro
irrigation
systems
is
that
in
other
installations
the
lateral lines are 12 to 32 mm.
That
is
the
maximum
in
case
of
micro
sprinkler
32
mm
it
can
be
and
normally
we
use
10
mm,
12
mm,
16
mm
pipeline
for
drip
irrigation.
Whereas
in
the
bubbler
system,
laterals
are
usually
of
50
mm
in
diameter
because
it
is
delivering
higher
dischar ge.
So
dischar ge
rate
is
high.
So
the
laterals
are
50
mm
high
and
these
pipelines
are
laid
below the ground level.
The
other
category
of
the
bubbler
is
gravity
flow
bubblers.
The
gravity
flow
bubblers
are
unique
because
they
are
not
designed
to
dissipate
energy
unlike
the
other
types
of
micro
irrigation.
Bubbler
emitters
are
essentially
delivery
tubes
for
transferring
the
water
from
irrigation
laterals
to
the
plants.
The
gravity
bubbler
system
operates
at
very low pressure.
That
is
about
10
kilo
Pascal
where
the
flow
rate
through
the
delivery
pipe
tube,
delivery
tubes
can
be
altered
by
adjusting
their
outlet
elevations
because
the
operating
head
of
the
bubbler
is
low.
That
is
about
1
m
head.
Small
changes
in
the
elevation
throughout
the
system
have
a
large
impact
on
dischar ge
rates.
Additionally ,
frictional
losses
within
the
pipe
and
tube
affect
the
water
pressure
within
the
system.
Thereforethey
affect
the
dischar ge
rate.
Because
here
again,
dischar ge
is
a
function
of
the
operating
pressure,
and
pressure
gets
affected
because
of
the
frictional
losses.
There
are some connectors, so they af fect the dischar ge rate.
For
a
small
diameter
smooth
pipe,
the
Darcy-W eisbach
and
Blasius
equation
has
been
combined
to
predict
the
frictional
head
loss
in
bubbler
tubes
that
has
been
given
by
Keller and Bliesner in 1990. The equation given by them is given that
‚Ñé ùëì=ùêæ ùëì ùëë ùë§√óùëÑ1.75
ùê∑4.75√óùêø
Where,
D = the inside diameter (mm),
Q = the flow within tube in (L  s
-1
),
L = the length of tube (m), and
K
fdw
= 7.89x10
5
, constant for SI units at a water
temperature of 20
O
C.
So
one
can
find
out
the
head
loss
in
this
pipe
when
the
Darcy-W eisbach
equation
and
Blasius equation have been combined in this part.
Now ,
one
can
find
out
how
much
head
loss
it
takes
place
when
these
are
the
dischar ge
rate
and
then
head
loss
has
been
estimated
for
the
different
size
of
the
pipeline,
for
the
different
size
of
the
internal
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
So
let
us
say
that
it
is
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline,
it
is
increasing.
You
can
see
4
mm,
6
mm
it
is
increasing
in
this direction. And this is the bound where Reynolds number is expressed.
So
Reynolds
number
that
is
this
10
is
to
power
6
to
that,
40
to
the
power
6.
That
is
your
1
lakh
to
4
lakh,
that
is
the
value.
So
head
loss
one
can
find
out.
Suppose
we
have
been
given
the
flow
rate
of
1
liter
per
second,
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline
is
104
mm
and
then
one
has
to
see
that
what
is
Reynolds
number
and
corresponding
to
Reynolds
number ,
the
values
of
Reynolds
number
one
has
to
choose.
And
then
one
can
get
the
value
of
the
head
loss,
gradient,
or
head
loss
that
is
expressed
in
meter
by
meter . So this particular factor one can get from this.Pressurized
bubbler
system.
The
pressurized
bubbler
systems
are
similar
in
design
to
the
alternative
micro
irrigation
system
and
typically
operate
between
50
kilo
Pascal
and
150
kilo
Pascal.
The
emission
device,
however ,
has
a
relatively
high
dischar ge
rate
that
is
up
to
225
liter
per
hour.
The
length
of
a
small-diameter
emission
tube
controls
the
rates
and
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
a
capillary
tube
in
the
drip
irrigation system.
Uniformity
can
be
achieved
by
adjusting
the
length
of
the
tube.
This
is
important
that
is
because
as
you
have
more
length,
more
coiling
length
you
are
doing
so
more
will
be
head
loss
and
that
will
disturb
the
uniformity .
So
one
has
to
see
that
part.
Dischar ge
rate
as
a
function
of
tube
length.
It
means
it
is
a
function
of
tube
length
and
can
be
derived
from
the
fundamental
principle
of
energy
conservation
within
the
bubbler
tube
which
can
be
derived
from
the
Bernoulli
equation
where
you
see
the
pressure
head,
elevation
head,
velocity
head
at
section
1
means
at
the
upstream
section
of
the
tube, where the pressure head it is given by the p 1.
So this is at location 1. And then this is equal to
ùëù 1Œ≥+ùëß 1+(ùëâ 1)2
2ùëî=ùëù 2Œ≥+ùëß 2+(ùëâ 2)2
2ùëî+‚àë‚Ñé ùëì+‚àë‚Ñé ùëö ùëô
Where,
h
f
= the friction head loss in pipes (m)
h
ml
= the minor losses at pipe fittings (m)
V
1
and
V
2
=
the
flow
velocities
of
water
in
the
pipe
at
locations
1
and
2,
respectively ,
(m s
-1
)
p
1
and p
2
= the pressures within the pipe at locations
1 and 2, respectively , (kPa)
z
1
and
z
2
=
the
elevations
of
pipe
at
locations
1
and
2,
with
respect
to
a
reference
datum (m)
Œ≥ = 
the specific weight of water , 9790 (N m
-3
) at
20
o
C; and
g = the gravitational constant, 9.81 (m s
-2
)
So
minor
losses
are
due
to
connections.
All
the
connectors,
elbow
joints
that
take
care
about
the
minor
losses
and
this
is
as
I
told
you
that
we
need
to
calculate
the
head
lossdue
to
friction
by
using
the
appropriate
equations
which
already
I
have
discussed
in
previous
class
by
using
Hazen-W illiams,
by
Darcy-W eisbach,
or
Scobey
formula.
Scobey formula is normally not used in pipes made up of plastics.
So
this
you
can
calculate.
Now ,
these
components
one
can
mean
these
already
I
have
explained.
So
this
is
for
the
second
location
or
downstream
location
in
the
pipeline.
When
we
apply
the
Bernoulli
equation,
bubbler
tube
points
1
and
2
can
be
set
at
the
entry
and
outlet
of
the
tube.
There
are
several
assumptions
that
have
been
made
to
simplify
this
equation.
These
assumptions
are
that
minor
losses
are
zero.
No
elevation
when
it
is
placed
in
the
same
elevation.
And
continuity
equation
applies,
means
V
1
is
equal to V 2. And then the P  2 is equal to 0.
That
means
the
water
which
is
coming
out
is
at
atmospheric
pressure.
So
P
2
is
equal
to
0.
So
finally ,
this
equation
results
in
this
form.
So
dischar ge
of
a
bubbler
tube
can
be given by
ùëû ùëè=ùêæ ùëè√ó(ùëÉùêø ùëè)0.5 7 √óùê∑2.7 1
Where,
q
b
= the bubbler tube dischar ge (L  h
-1
)
P = the operating pressure (kPa)
L
b
= the length of bubbler tube (cm)
D = the diameter of bubbler tube (mm) and
K
b
= 5.52, a constant for units of variables as defined
So
if
we
are
putting
all
these
things,
we
need
to
put
the
Kb
equal
to
5.
52
to
get
the
value of dischar ge from the bubbler tube.
Now
one
can
find
out
what
is
the
bubbler
dischar ge
by
using
this
monograph.
So
this
monograph
has
been
developed
when
the
diameter
is
ranging
from
1
mm
to
10
mm
and
then
operating
pressure
is
10
kilo
Pascal
and
length
it
is
varying
from
10
cm
to
5
m.
So
this
is
the
range
which
has
been,
this
has
been
estimated.
And
you
can
see
if
I
take any value and then we see, what is the diameter?Let
us
say
that
my
diameter ,
for
my
length
of
the
tube
is,
length
of
the
tube
is
2
m
that
is
200
cm,
and
then
the
diameter
is
this.
So
I
will
be
using
say
diameter
is
10
mm.
Then
corresponding
dischar ge,
I
can
get
that
what
is
the
dischar ge.
So
I
will
get
a
dischar ge.
It
is
about
we
are
getting
about
500
liter
per
hour.
So
like
this
directly
one
can find out without calculation by using this type of graph.
Another
one
is
if
we
are
interested
to
find
out
what
should
be
the
required
length.
Then
if
it
is
the
required
length
of
2
mm
and
then
the
3
m
tubing
for
the
desired
dischar ge
rate
in
liter
according
to
the
inlet
pressure.
So
I
can
find
out
what
should
be
the
desired
dischar ge
rate.
So
if
this
is
one
case.
This
is
when
the
diameter
is
taken
as
2
mm
and
then
if
I
want
to
get
what
should
be
the
dischar ge
from
this
particular
tube.
So
given
pressure
and
then
selecting
a
particular
length
I
can
know
that
what
will
be
the dischar ge of the particular bubbler system.
So
in
this
particular ,
in
these
two
things,
when
the
two
means
two
diameters
of
the
pipelines
are
available
and
then
given
the
bubbler
tube
length
and
then
one
can
know
what
is
the
given
pressure
what
will
be
the
required
dischar ge.
Or
for
an
assumed
dischar ge
and
the
length
of
the
tube,
one
can
find
out
what
will
be
the
operating
pressure so that one can get better uniformity of application.
Irrigation
scheduling
with
bubbler
irrigation
percentage
of
root
soil
volume
wetted
is
about
80%
because
water
given
is
in
more
in
quantity ,
large
in
quantity .
So
wetting
zone,
root
zone
wetting
is
more.
So
it
is
about
80%.
And
there
is
no
restriction,
there
are
no
restrictions
on
the
way
of
scheduling
the
program
means
it
can
be
preprogrammed. So no restriction on the way the irrigation program is prepared.
This
can
be
either
fixed
depletion
or
fixed
interval
means
either
we
are
fixing
the
depletion
level
that
we
need
to
have
the
depletion
level
of
80%,
70%.
So
depending
on
the
depletion,
an
irrigation
schedule
can
be
made.
Or
someone
wants
to
make
the
interval that every 5 days I need to give irrigation, this is also possible.So
taking
into
consideration
the
soil
water
holding
capacity
that
is
the
field
capacity
of
the
soil
and
the
availability
of
irrigation
water
and
the
size
of
the
flow.
Then
the
design
criteria
and
concentration,
the
bubbler
irrigation
is
mainly
applied
to
fruit
tree
orchards.
And
the
most
important
criteria
apart
from
routine
design
criteria
are
the
system‚Äô s
special
features
and
characteristics.
Bubbler
emitter
dischar ges
water
on
the
same
part
of
the
ground
at
high
rates.
Thus
for
a
uniform
distribution
over
basin
area,
minimum of land preparation is required.
A
mature
tree
always
takes
two
bubbler
emitters
on
each
side
in
order
to
ensure
acceptable
uniformity
of
water
application
because,
in
the
case
of
mature
trees,
the
water
requirement
is
high.
I
think
the
bubbler
irrigation
is
appropriate
in
that
case
and
the two bubblers will take care of meeting the water requirement of such trees.
The
common
practice
is
to
have
one
lateral
per
two
rows
of
the
trees
with
small
flexible
tube
extended
on
both
the
side
and
connected
to
the
bubbler .
That
is
the
normal
common
practice
but
in
order
to
see
that
when
the
plants
are
old,
and
then
the
rooting
systems
are
deep
and
they
were
being
given
the
conventional
irrigation.
So
the
root
systems
are
deep
and
then
it
has
got
large
root
zone
depth.
So
in
that
case,
this
kind of practice that two bubblers are used.
In
this
way
the
same
size
of
the
lateral
pipe
placed,
buried,
it
is
kept
below
the
ground
level
between
two
rows
can
serve
the
12
trees
on
each
side.
So
which
is
spaced
6
m
interval
with
48
bubblers
system,
bubbler
emitters.
So
if
we
are
putting
it
for
the
12
trees
and
then
two
laterals
are
kept.
So
we
will
be
putting
two
deeper
surfaces
there
are
24
trees
in
total
and
that
is
at
6
m
intervals.
So
we
need
24
into
2
that
is
a
48
number of bubbler will be required.
The
size
of
the
equipment
for
installation
should
always
be
able
to
accommodate
the
flow
required
for
maturity .
This
one
should
take
care
for
longer
laterals.
Pressure
compensated
bubblers
can
also
be
used
which
involves
higher
energy
consumption,
more expensive, and higher pressure drop.So
this
is
a
typical
bubbler
laying
system
where
you
can
see
this
is
laid
in
a
1.15
hectare
area.
So
this
is
120
m
long
and
96
m
wide
and
these
are
the
trees
where
you
see
this
is
a
tree.
And
in
between
the
tree,
this
is
the
lateral
line
which
is
passing.
And
then
on
each
lateral
pipeline,
the
bubblers
are
attached.
And
this
bubbler
will
be
given, there will be an appropriate number of bubblers depending on the requirement.
Maybe
two
bubblers
or
one
bubbler
to
each
tree.
That
can
be
taken
care
depending
on
after
knowing
the
water
distribution.
So
you
can
see
there
is
a
water
source,
from
the
water
source
the
water
is
brought
with
the
help
of
a
pump.
And
then
the
pump
is
connected.
Then
there
is
the
main
pipeline
and
from
the
main
pipeline,
there
is
a
sub-main
manifold
and
from
the
sub-main
manifold,
these
laterals
are
attached.
These
laterals go along the plant rows.
So
you
may
refer
to
these
books
for
this
topic
and
then
let
us
summarize
this
lecture.
We
have
discussed
about
the
bubbler
irrigation
system.
We
also
discussed
the
two
types
of
bubbler
system.
One
is
the
gravity
flow
type
of
bubbler
or
pressure
flow
type
of bubbler . We made the comparative advantages and disadvantages of this system.
We
also
discussed
about
irrigation
scheduling
and
then
what
are
the
important
design
consideration
one
should
take
care.
In
the
forthcoming
class,
we
will
discuss
about
sprinkler irrigation system, and thank you very much.
