Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics and its Application in Micr o Irrigation
Hello
participants,
I
invite
you
to
lecture
2
micro
irrigation
engineering
subject.
This
lecture
is
on
the
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
and
its
application
in
micro
irrigation
engineering.
In
this
particular
lecture,
we
are
just
exposing
you
to
the
different
terminologies
which
are
dealing
with
fluids,
mainly
water .
We
will
be
using
basic
equations
in
micro
irrigation
engineering,
so
the
fluid mechanic concepts are being dealt with.
This
is
a
very
brief
lecture
on
the
fluid
mechanic's
aspect
which
will
be
discussed.
You
have
been
given
in
your
other
subject,
a
fluid
mechanic
subject
where
you
might
have
been
taught
in
detail
about
the
fluid
mechanics
part.
But
here
it
is
briefly
we
are
talking
so
which
will
be
directly
relevant to micro-irrigation.
In
this
particular
lecture,
we
are
dealing
with
the
properties
and
types
of
fluid.
Pressure
and
its
measurement, kinematics of dynamics of fluid flow , this will be discussed.
Now
when
we
talk
of
fluid
mechanics,
fluid
is
a
substance
that
deforms
continuously
under
the
action
of
shear
stress
regardless
of
its
magnitude
and
this
can
be
a
gas
or
a
liquid.
When
we
talk
of
fluid
mechanics,
it
is
the
branch
of
science
which
deals
with
the
behavior
of
fluid
at
rest
as
well
as
in
motion.
So,
fluid
can
be
in
the
position
which
is
at
the
rest
position
or
it
can
be
in
the
motion.
We
can
classify
fluid
mechanics
into
3
components.
So,
one
classification
when
we
say
fluid
statics
means
fluid
is
at
rest.
Water
is
stored
in
the
tank,
which
means
the
liquid
is
in
rest
position,
so
that
is
a
fluid
static.
And
we
are
finding
out
what
is
the
head
of
water ,
how
much
is
the pressure at this water depending on the depth of water , whether it is below the soil?When
we
are
talking
groundwater
there
also
we
are
talking
about
the
amount
of
water
available
in
the
well
or
the
depth
of
water
which
is
at
the
rest
position
in
a
reservoir ,
in
a
tank,
it
is
fluid
statics.
When
we
talk
of
fluid
kinematics,
so
fluid
is
in
motion
without
considering
the
force.
And
fluid
dynamics
means
fluid
in
motion
when
we
consider
the
effect
of
forces.
So,
the
effect
of
forces
with
the
flow
when
we
are
talking
means
this
is
basically
fluid
dynamics
when
we
say
flow
through
the
pipe
and
flow
through
a
deformable
boundary .
A
pipe
has
a
fixed
boundary ,
but
when
it
is
a
deformable
boundary ,
so
there
are
forces
also
working,
and
then
the
water
is
also
taken means flow is also taking place.
Now ,
there
are
different
fluid
properties
we
come
across.
There
are
different
terminologies
we
come
across
when
we
are
talking
about
fluid.
So,
one
is
density ,
and
density
is
given
by
mass
per
unit
volume
and
the
density
of
water
is
considered
as
1000
and
it
is
expressed
as
kilogram
per
cubic
meter .
A
specific
weight
when
we
talk,
the
weight
of
fluid
per
unit
volume
of
fluid.
The
specific
weight
of
water
is
9810
and
the
unit
is
expressed
in
force,
so
this
is
Newton
per
cubic
meter .
Specific
gravity
is
the
ratio
of
the
weight
density
of
the
fluid
to
the
weight
density
of
a
standard
fluid,
that
is
your
water .
The
specific
gravity
of
the
water
is
1.
Viscosity ,
there
are
two
types
of
viscosity
one
is
the
dynamic
viscosity ,
another
one
is
the
kinematic
viscosity .
So,
viscosity
is
a
measure
of
the
resistance
of
fluid
flow
as
a
result
of
intermolecular
cohesion.
For
water ,
the
dynamic viscosity is 1.14 × 10
-3
N-s/m
2
.
Kinematic
viscosity
is
the
ratio
of
the
dynamic
viscosity
to
the
density
of
the
fluid.
And
its
value
for
water
is
1.14
×
10
-6
m
2
/s.
Surface
tension
is
used
basically
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
soil
water
tension
when
we
are
talking
about,
how
much
water
is
held
by
the
soil
particles
because
of
the forces of surface tension.So,
a
tensile
force
acting
on
the
surface
of
a
liquid
that
is
in
contact
with
the
gas
or
other
liquid
is
expressed
in
Newton
per
meter .
Capillarity
is
another
phenomenon
in
which
water
moves
through
the
capillary
forces
through
the
capillary
motion.
So,
there
is
say
water
table
that
is
a
saturated
zone,
and
water
moves
from
the
saturated
zone
to
the
root
zone
of
the
plant.
So,
water
movement takes place through the capillary motion.
So,
rise
and
fall
of
the
liquid
surface
in
a
small
tube
relative
to
the
adjacent
general
level
of
liquid
when
the
tube
is
held
vertically
in
the
liquid,
generally
it
is
defined
but
it
is
applicable
when
there
is
a
saturated
soil
and
from
the
saturated
soil
water
moved
from
the
saturated
media
to the unsaturated media that is the capillarity action it takes place.
Types
of
fluid,
these
fluids
can
be
given
by
ideal
fluid
it
can
be
real
fluid,
Newtonian
fluid,
non-Newtonian
fluid,
or
ideal
plastics.
So,
this
fluid
when
we
say
ideal
fluid,
ideal
fluid
it
is
incompressible
having
no
viscosity ,
practically
such
fluid
does
not
exist.
Ideal
fluid
is
the
case
which
you
see
here
and
means
it
is
just
you
can
see
this
is
the
rate
of
demarcation
that
is
you
are
seeing here is ideal, this particular part it is known as the ideal fluid.
The
real
fluid
having
some
viscosity
and
all
fluids
are
considered
as
real
fluid.
Newtonian
fluid,
when
we
say
means
it
is
a
real
fluid
in
which
the
shear
stress
is
directly
proportional
to
the
shear
stress.
So,
in
this
particular
part
when
you
are
drawing
there
is
a
straight
line
you
see
a
straight
line that passes to the 45-degree line between the rate of the formation is nothing but your stress.
So,
this
is
a
shear
strain
and
this
is
shear
stress.
So,
when
we
have
plotted
and
then
45-degree
line
when
the
slope
is
equal
to
1
this
is
your
Newtonian
fluid.
Non-Newtonian
flow
when
it
does
not
follow
this
particular
graph.
An
ideal
plastic
is
in
which
the
shear
stress
is
proportional
to
the
rate
of
shear
strain
and
shear
stress
is
more
than
the
yield
value.
So,
this
is
the
case
with
your
ideal plastic.Pressure,
we
are
using
this
particular
terminology
when
the
fluid
or
water
flow
takes
place.
We
are
measuring
how
much
pressure
in
the
pipeline
or
how
much
is
the
pressure
at
the
drip
system
is
to
be
operated.
What
is
the
pressure
at
which
the
sprinkler
systems
should
be
operated?
So,
pressure is an important point and this is why I am discussing it in this particular lecture.
So,
pressure
is
defined
as
the
amount
of
force
exerted
by
the
fluid
on
any
boundary
it
is
in
contact
with.
So,
pressure
is
given
by
force
per
unit
area.
It
is
given
by
Newton
per
square
meter .
And
then
the
pressure
is
measured
or
it
is
expressed
in
different
ways
gauge
pressure,
sometimes
we
say
absolute
pressure,
sometimes
we
say
negative
pressure
that
is
a
vacuum,
and
sometimes
we use dif ferential pressure.
So,
there
are
different
terminologies
that
are
used
and
when
we
say
gauge
pressure
it
means
the
reference
to
atmospheric
pressure.
So,
water
level
measurement
or
in
pipe
hydraulics,
we
use
gauge
pressure.
Absolute
pressure,
when
we
talk
of
the
reference
is
a
vacuum
and
it
is
used
in
measuring
the
barometric
pressure,
and
for
many
metrological
operations,
we
do
use
absolute
pressure.
Vacuum,
when
we
say
means
the
pressure
is
below
atmospheric
pressure
and
there
are
pumps
which
are
used
to
measure
the
vacuum
pumps.
Or
there
are
say
when
we
are
talking
about
the
soil
water
tension
or
soil
water
concept
when
we
are
dealing
tensiometer
is
used.
So,
the
tensiometer
is
using
the
concept
of
the
vacuum
or
when
we
are
using
the
Venturi
system.
So,
Venturi
system,
if
the
pressure
reduces
means
it
becomes
negative
pressure
then
only
the
Venturi
will suck the water .
So,
in
the
fertigation
system,
we
use
a
vacuum
type
of
condition
so
a
vacuum
is
used.
And
differential
pressure
measuring
the
difference
between
2
pressure
port
readings
and
is
used
for
the
measurement
of
the
pressure
across
the
filter .
Filter
means
your
drip
irrigation
filter
I
am
telling
you
that
is
used
for
monitoring
the
pressure
at
different
points
in
the
pipeline,
so
that
is
a
differential pressure which is used.Now
when
the
water
is
moving
in
a
pipeline
or
it
is
in
a
pipeline,
how
much
pressure
of
water
is
available?
This
is
just
simply
a
piezometric
tube
that
gives
what
is
the
pressure
available.
So,
h
refers
to
the
pressure
in
the
piezometric
tube
or
the
pipeline
when
we
are
taking
the
U-tube
manometer . So, the U-tube manometer gives that how much is pressure available in the pipeline.
So,
in
the
manometer ,
if
there
are
suppose
this
is
the
water
and
then
another
one
is
your
mercury
or
alcohol
is
used.
So,
there
we
are
using
a
U-tube
manometer
and
find
out
how
much
is
the
water
pressure
is
available.
So,
this
delta
h
means
the
pressure
available
the
difference
here
between these 2 points this pressure is your manometric pressure between the two points.
There
is
a
differential
manometer ,
it
is
also
used.
You
can
see
here
fluid
is
flowing
and
then
this
is
used.
So,
you
are
taking
the
measurement
at
this
left
limb
of
what
is
the
water
level
available.
And
at
the
other
right
limb,
you
are
getting
the
difference
between
these
levels
are
used
for
this
one. There are dif ferent other pressure measuring gauges available.
This
is
your
bourdon
gauge
pressure
and
then
you
are
using
another
pressure
gauge.
So,
this
is
the
front
view
and
this
is
the
rear
view
of
your
pressure
gauge.
So,
these
kinds
of
pressure
gauges
are being used to monitor the pressure, liquid pressure, or gas pressure.
Kinematics
of
the
fluid
flow,
fluid
kinematics
deals
with
the
motion
of
fluids
without
considering
the
forces
and
movements
which
create
the
motion.
So,
methods
of
describing
fluid
flow
motion,
one
is
the
Lagrangian
description,
that
tracks
the
position
and
velocity
of
individual
particles
that
are
used
in
the
case
of
Lagrangian
description.
Eulerian
description,
a
flow
domain
or
control
volume
is
defined
by
fluid
flows
in
and
out,
means
how
much
is
the
fluid
it
is
entering
in
the
control volume and how much is the fluid which is going out of the control volume.
So,
this
difference
particularly
when
we
are
talking
of
the
conservation
of
mass
at
that
particular
point we are using the Eulerian description, most commonly used in the fluid flow .The
types
of
fluid
flow
we
discussing
here
is
the
steady-state
flow
means
the
velocity
component
is
independent
of
time
so
that
it
becomes
your
steady-state
flow.
Unsteady
state
flow
having
a
function
of
time.
Means
dv/dt
means
the
first
derivative
of
the
velocity
with
respect
to
time
is
not
equal to 0. When we call it a uniform flow , it means the velocity does not change with space.
This
means
when
we
are
taking
2
sections,
particularly
of
open
channel
flow.
In
open
channel
flow,
we
considered
uniform
flow.
So,
Manning's
equation
is
the
example
of
uniform
flow
formula,
where
we
consider
the
velocity
which
is
independent
of
the
space
as
well
as
other
properties,
the
dischar ge,
the
pressure
with
respect
to
time
between
2
sections
it
remains
the
same.
And
the
non-uniform
flow
when
the
dv/dl
is
not
equal
to
0.
Laminar
flow
has
defined
the
state
of
flow
where
the
laminar
means
the
ratio
of
the
inertial
flow
to
the
viscous
pore.
Viscous
flow
that
gives
threshold
Reynolds
number
is
less
than
2000,
it
is
considered
as
up
to
2200.
It
is
considered
ideal
laminar
flow.
And
then
the
value
it
is
given
that
when
the
Reynolds
number
goes more than 4000 is turbulent flow and in between these two, there is a transitional flow .
Compressible
or
incompressible
flow
is
another
category
of
the
flow
and
these
are
being
dealt
with.
The
flow
can
be
one
dimensional,
two
dimensional,
three
dimensional
depending
upon
the
particular
material
and
at
through
which
the
flow
takes
place.
Accordingly ,
these
properties,
these
types
of
flows
they
are
defined.
Rotational
flow,
irrotational
flow,
so
where
from
the
flow
is taking place.
The
continuity
equation
is
following
the
principle
of
conservation
of
mass
and
you
are
seeing
here
two
sections
say
we
are
considering
a
pipe
flow.
So,
one
section
where
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline
is
here
the
section
1
is
like
this,
and
then
when
you
see
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline
is
this
one.
So,
the
velocity
component,
as
well
as
the
area,
is
different,
so
we
can
say
at
section
1,
the density , area, and velocity that can be given at section 1 as:ρ 1𝐴 1𝑉 1=ρ 2𝐴 2𝑉 2
So,
2
refers
to
section
2,
this
particular
equation
is
applicable
for
compressible
and
incompressible
fluids.
Fluid
dynamics
deals
with
the
motion
of
fluid
considering
the
forces
causing
the
flow.
So,
these
could
be
forces
in
fluid
flow
and
so
what
are
the
forces
one
is
the
gravity
force
means
when
we
are
talking
about
the
Froude
number .
So,
the
gravity
force
is
important
when
we
are
talking
about
the
pressure
force
means
the
fluid
at
the
rest
height,
at
what
cost it is working.
So,
this
is
the
pressure
gauge
which
I
was
telling
you
at
what
pressure
the
water
is
flowing
into
the
pipeline.
So,
pressure
force
can
consider
force
due
to
viscosity .
That
is
means
when
we
are
talking
about
how
much
is
the
viscosity
of
the
fluid.
So,
particularly
this
is
more
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
viscous
material,
where
viscosity
is
important,
so
Navier -Stokes
theorem
or
when we are adding fertilizer with the water and then fertigation takes place.
So,
forces
due
to
viscosity
are
considered
when
we
talk
about
the
turbulent
force
means
your
inertial
force
is
more
than
the
viscous
force
then
turbulence
takes
place.
And
then
compressibility
there
could
be
a
different
situation
when
the
compressibility
takes
place.
But
here
in
our
case,
we
are
taking
the
incompressible
flow.
So,
the
equation
of
the
motion
that
deals
with
means
when
we
are
using
Reynolds
equation
of
the
motion,
force
is
due
to
compressibility
is neglected.
When
we
talk
of
the
Navier -Stokes
theorem
force
is
due
to
turbulence
is
neglected
but
other
forces
are
prominent.
And
when
we
talk
about
Euler ’s
equation,
the
flow
we
assume
ideal
and
zero viscous force take place.
Bernoulli’ s
equation,
is
one
of
the
forms
of
the
energy
equation
and
it
is
assumed
that
the
flow
is
inviscid
or
frictionless,
flow
is
steady
and
flow
is
incompressible.
The
flow
is
considered
along
the
same
streamline.
And
when
you
are
considering
Bernoulli’ s
principle,
you
are
taking
section1,
this
is
the
pipe
flow
you
are
taking
that
is
a
one.
This
is
the
inlet
section
of
the
pipe
and
this
is
the throat section of the pipeline.
Mainly
you
can
see
this
is
the
case
of
a
Venturi
meter ,
the
Venturi
meter
looks
like
the
same.
So,
here
in
section
1,
the
area,
this
is
your
area
vector ,
this
is
the
velocity
vector ,
and
this
is
the
pressure
part.
So,
at
the
point
1,
and
1
it
is
given
by
A
1
,
V
1,
and
P
1
and
at
point
2
that
is
your
throat
section.
So,
when
the
area
reduces
from
A
1
to
A
2
means
in
diameter
of
the
pipeline
it
reduces this.
That
has
caused
the
increase
in
the
velocity
and
that
change
the
pressure
component
and
this
pressure
means
it
has
reduced
because
of
the
increase
in
the
velocity .
So,
this
is
what
is
explained
by
Bernoulli’ s
equation,
that
the
velocity
V
2
/2g
plus
this
is
your
elevation
head
z
and
this
is
your
pressure
head
that
is
equal
to
constant.
When
we
are
taking
2
sections
so,
we
can
write
(𝑉 1)2
2𝑔+𝑍 1+𝑃 1ρ 1𝑔=(𝑉 2)2
2𝑔+𝑍 2+𝑃 2ρ 2𝑔
So, and if we assume this is in the same plane means this is at the same level.
So,    V
1
2
- V
2
2
= (P
2
- P
1
)
So, this will come in this form that is how the pressure dif ference takes place.
The
continuity
equation
is
defined
by
the
partial
differential
form
of
this
equation
that
is
the
velocity in the X direction, partial means velocity in the X direction
∂𝑢∂𝑥+∂𝑣∂𝑦+∂𝑤∂𝑧=0
So,
in
the
differential
form,
this
continuity
equation
is
given
by
this
one,
which
is
in
the
x,
y,
and
z-direction. We in the algebraic form this continuity equation it is given by
A
1
V
1
= A
2
V
2
Or just now , in the previous case, we have given
ρ
1
A
1
V
1
=
ρ
2
A
2
V
2
.When
we
are
considering
the
density
component
is
different,
the
area
component
is
different
and
the
velocity
component
is
different.
But
both
the
side
it
becomes
equal
that
is
the
continuity
equation.
Navier -stokes
theorem
is
defined
by
these
equations
where
you
can
see
the
force
means
this
particular
let
me
just
discuss
this
part
the
rate
of
change
of
momentum
that
is
with
respect
to
time is dealt by
∂(ρ𝑢)∂𝑡+∇.ρ𝑢𝑈()=−∂𝑝∂𝑥+µ∇2 𝑢+ρ𝑓 𝑥
∂(ρ𝑣)∂𝑡+∇.ρ𝑣𝑈()=−∂𝑝∂𝑦+µ∇2 𝑣+ρ𝑓 𝑦
∂(ρ𝑤)∂𝑡+∇.ρ𝑤𝑈()=−∂𝑝∂𝑧+µ∇2 𝑤+ρ𝑓 𝑧
That
is
your
one
means
your
direction
that
is
your
rho
u
capital
U.
So,
this
is
the
velocity
component.
In
your
i,
j,
and
k
or
i,
j,
and
w
that
is
in
three-dimensional
form
this
velocity
is
given.
And
then
that
can
be
given
by
the
change
in
the
pressure
head
in
x-direction
plus
the
viscosity
multiplied
by
these
mean
derivative
second
derivative
of
the
velocity
component,
that
is del square u plus the body force.
This
particular
component
is
the
body
force
the
rho
into
fx,
similarly ,
in
the
y-direction,
it
has
been
given
So,
Navier -stokes
theorem
is
describing
the
flow
when
the
density
of
the
liquid
and
the flow is incompressible that can be considered.
Now
there
are
different
units
that
are
used
in
fluid
problems
and
particularly ,
so
one
can
use
these
units
and
convert
them
into
the
other .
So,
normally
SI
unit
is
used
and
but
if
the
problem
we
are
given
in
another
system
then
this
can
be
converted
to
other
systems.
So,
length
is
given
from
1
meter
to
1
kilometer
like
this
and
then
it
can
be
equivalent
to
different
unit
feet,
centimeter , millimeter , and miles.Similarly
the
volume
units
it
is
expressed
in
a
liter,
meter
cube,
feet
cube,
and
which
is
equivalent
to
gallons
or
liter.
So,
this
is
already
available,
area
it
is
expressed
in
an
acre
or
hectare,
so
they
are
equivalent
and
thee
are
available.
Pressure,
we
are
expressing
in
kg
per
square
centimeter
which
is
equivalent
to
10.3
meters
of
the
water
column.
So,
this
is
a
value
that
is used when we are operating the sprinkler system.
This
is
the
value
that
means
your
kg
per
square
centimeter
when
we
are
using
it
in
sprinkler
system,
drip
irrigation
system,
micro-irrigation
system
we
are
using.
When
we
are
talking
about
the
pressure
in
the
atmosphere
normally
this
is
used
in
the
soil
water
concept
when
we
are
using
the
water
held
by
the
soil
particle
that
in
the
negative
pressure.
So,
that
is
expressed
in
the
soil
in
the atmosphere are these are the other unit which you are using.
Also,
you
find
out
the
dischar ge,
so
different
units
of
dischar ge
either
in
meter
cube
per
second
or in liter per second, these are used.
So,
for
this
particular
topic
you
refer
to
these
books
for
getting
more
details,
I
have
just
discussed
in a short about this particular concept it can be used in micro irrigation subject.
So,
we
discussed
in
this
particular
lecture,
what
are
the
different
types
of
fluids.
We
discussed
how
to
measure
the
pressure
measurement,
differential
pressure
as
well
as
absolute
pressure.
We
also
discuss
different
types
of
fluid
flow
kinematics
of
kinematics
or
dynamics
of
fluid
flow.
We
also
discussed
the
Continuity
equation,
Bernoulli’ s
equation,
Navier -stokes
equations.
Now
in
the coming lecture, we will be discussing about soil water concept.
Thank you very much.
