Economic Analysis of MIS (Part 2)
Hello,
participants.
I
invite
you
to
Lecture
56
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
subject.
Lecture
56
is
on
Economic
Analysis
of
Micro
Irrigation
System,
Part
2.
On
the
same
topic,
Part
1
in
Lecture
54,
we
discussed
about
different
terminologies
which
are
important
for
economic
evaluation
where
different
types
of
cost
terms
it
comes,
benefit
cost
analysis,
net
present
worth,
how
to
compute,
so
different
expressions
which
are
involved
to
estimate
we
discussed in previous lecture.
In
this
lecture,
we
are
going
to
discuss
on
the
critical
flow
criteria,
for
selection
of
micro
irrigation
pipes.
We
will
be
dealing
with
optimal
flow
and
this
concept
has
been
utilized
considering
a
hypothetical
example
for
say
sector
area
in
order
to
make
you
understand
how
optimal flow criteria can be used to select the particular size of pipeline.
In
theoretical
consideration
before
I
speak
about
different
terms
involved,
let
us
try
to
first
revise
the
terms
which
we
discussed
in
the
design
part.
In
design,
we
estimated
head
loss
due
to
friction.
Our
aim
was
to
reduce
the
head
loss
due
to
friction.
So,
we
are
considering
these
size
of
the
pipeline
in
such
a
way
whether
it
is
a
main
pipeline
of
micro
irrigation
system,
whether it is a sub main pipeline of micro irrigation system or it is a lateral pipeline.
So,
our
aim
was
to
reduce
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
and
other
losses,
which
takes
place
in
the
pipeline.
So,
if
we
are
considering
say
one
particular
pipe
size
and
we
find
that
head
loss
due
to
friction
is
some
quantity
in
meter .
And
then,
we
are
taking
another
which
is
higher
than
the
previous
one.
So,
question
comes,
what
should
be
the
size
of
the
pipeline
one
should
select?
So,
one
always
feels
that
yes
if
I
am
going
for
the
larger
size
then
economics
come
into
picture
that
whether
we
are
taking
a
new
higher
size
pipeline,
then
economics
is
important.Now ,
if
we
are
considering
this
shorter
pipeline
means
head
loss
due
to
friction
will
increase.
But,
it
is
in
the
permissible
level.
But,
the
amount
of
energy
required
because
that
is
a
variable
cost.
It
will
continue
to
every
time
when
you
are
operating,
the
variable
cost
will
increase.
So,
that
is
a
cost
which
will
be
recurring
almost
daily
as
and
when
we
operate
the
pump.
So,
these
2
costs
which
are
there
one
is
due
to
the
size
of
the
pipeline.
Other
cost
is
due
to
operational
that
is
variable
cost,
so,
operational
cost.
So,
these
2
things
are
to
be
considered what size of the pipeline should be considered.
So,
life,
this
term
which
has
come,
it
is
a
life
cycle
costing
technique.
It
has
been
used
to
optimize
the
pipe
diameter
to
determine
the
optimal
flow
between
2
pipe
sizes,
2
adjacent
pipe
sizes
or
2
pipe
sizes
which
are
just
one
is
say
12
millimeter
another
one
is
16
millimeter
for
the
case
of
lateral.
So,
whether
should
I
go
for
12
millimeter?
I
should
go
for
16
millimeter . That is the 2 adjacent pipe means.
Now ,
when
we
talk
of
the
economic
optimization
part,
we
need
to
consider
several
factors.
That
is
the
size,
market
price
and
then,
what
is
the
application
rate?
And
then,
how
many
hours
the
system
in
a
year
this
pump
will
operate?
And
then,
what
is
the
overall
efficiency
of
the
system?
All
these
things
will
come.
The
important
term
here
it
will
be
used
in
all
throughout my presentation is optimal flow .
What
is
this
optimal
flow?
It
is
the
flow
rate
at
which
the
total
annual
cost
between
2
adjacent
pipes
can
be
equated.
Means,
we
are
equating
these
2
pipes.
And
then,
seeing
that
which
pipeline
will
be
giving
best
flow
rate
which
will
be
useful
for
us.
So,
these
2
pipeline
values
they will be used and then in order to find out the optimal flow between the 2 diameters.
Now ,
if
we
are
considering
let
us
say
D1
and
D2
are
the
2
pipe
sizes
and
their
respective
cost
per
unit
length
is
given
as
a
C1,
and
C2
that
these
terms
we
will
use
in
further .
But,
let
us
come
to
what
is
the
capital
recovery
factor?
This
is
a
common
terminology
when
we
are
making
the
estimation.
So,
capital
recovery
factor
it
is
a
function
of
prevailing
interest
rate
in
a given period of time.
𝐶𝑅𝐹=𝑖(1+𝑖)𝑛
(1+𝑖)𝑛−1So,
n
is
the
number
of
life
period,
number
of
years.
And
then,
i
is
the
interest
rate
in
percentage.
When
we
are
talking
about
the
total
cost
to
estimate
to
we
are
interested
about
the
finding
out
the
critical
flow.
So,
critical
flow
criteria
means
we
will
be
equating
these
2
terms.
That
is
one
total
cost
is
the
annual
cost
of
the
pipe
and
annual
cost
of
pumping.
One
it
is
written
to
refers to the diameter D1. Now , similarly , for other diameter D 2, TAC 2 can be computed.
TAC
1
= (AC
1
)
pipe
+ (AC
1
)
pump
Now ,
as
I
told
you
that
according
to
this
criteria,
these
2
cost,
one
is
the
cost
of
the
pump
and
of
the
diameter
D
1
and
cost
of
pumping
by
using
the
pipe
diameter ,
A1
is
equated
with
the
annual
cost
of
the
pipe
having
diameter
D
2.
And
then,
corresponding
what
is
the
annual
cost
of pumping for the diameter D 2. So, these are equated.
(AC
1
)
pipe
+ (AC
1
)
pump
= (AC
2
)
pipe
+ (AC
2
)
pump
Now , these annual cost is put up in the form of fixed cost and operating cost.
(FC
1
)
pipe
+ (OC
1
)
pump
= (FC
2
)
pipe
+ (OC
2
)
pump
The
term
in
this
subscript
1
refers
to
the
diameter
D
1
and
subscript
2
refers
to
the
diameter
D
2. So, FC 1, FC 2 these are the fixed cost and operating cost.
Now ,
this
can
be
given
that
means
fixed
cost
and
operating
cost
it
is
brought
in
terms
of
the
horsepower
requirement
multiplied
by
the
cost
of
the
water
horsepower .
So,
this
part
when
operating
cost
it
is
brought,
it
is
brought
in
terms
of
the
economics
value.
So,
this
can
be
given
as
means
this
is
a
standard
formula
the
horsepower ,
horsepower
can
be
computed
by
this one.
(𝐹𝐶1)𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒+𝑄𝑢𝐻1
(
)𝐶𝑊𝐻𝑃75×3600=(𝐹𝐶2)𝑝𝑖𝑝𝑒+𝑄𝑢𝐻2
(
)
75×3600
That
is
the
flow
rate
multiplied
by
the
head.
So,
this
H
1
and
H
2,
these
are
the
head
losses
or
head
we
can
say
total
head
of
the
pipeline.
And,
the
diameters
are
D
1
and
D
2.
And
this
is
simply
dischar ge
of
the
unit
that
is
the
flow
into
the
system.
And
then,
this
is
a
unit
constant
it is given in the liter per hour . So, this way we are putting it the equating this part.The
cost
of
the
horsepower
is
given
by
the
energy
cost
multiplied
by
the
horsepower
operating
horsepower
per
unit.
Means,
in
a
year,
how
many
hours
the
pump
will
operate
divided by the pumping ef ficiency?
𝐶𝑊𝐻𝑃=𝐻0𝐶0𝐸𝑓
So,
when
we
are
using
this
particular
equation,
equation
5
is
written
in
this
form.
This
can
be
written as
𝑄𝑢75×3600𝐻1−𝐻2
(
)𝐶𝑊𝐻𝑃=𝐷𝐹
And therefore
𝐻1−𝐻2
(
)= 𝐷𝐹 𝑥 75 𝑥 3600𝐶𝑊𝐻𝑃×𝑄𝑢
Where,
H
1
and H
2
= head losses due to friction in pipes of
diameter D
1
and D
2
respectively
Q
u
= total flow into the unit (L  h
-1
)
DF            = dif ference in annual fixed cost per unit
length of pipes D
1
and D
2
(Rs.)
C
WHP
= cost of water horse power (Rs.)
H
o
= hours operating of system per year
C
o
= ener gy cost (Rs. / bhp h)
E
f
= overall pumping ef ficiency
This
is
the
difference
means
we
are
equating
this
part.
So,
this
has
come
as
H
1
minus
H
2
multiplied
by
the
cost
of
the
water
horsepower
is
equal
to
the
difference
in
annual
fixed
cost.
Difference
in
the
annual
fixed
cost
means
when
we
are
considering
D
1
and
D
2.
So,
this
way
we
are
getting
the
expression.
What
is
the
means
expression
we
can
get
in
terms
of
H
1
minus
H 2? That is the head loss when we are considering 2 diameters in terms of the cost unit.
Now ,
this
particular
equation,
which
we
have
got
equation
to
this
head
loss.
So,
head
loss
is
equated.
That
is
Hf.
Hf
is
equated
by
using
the
appropriate
friction
factor
depending
on
the
type
of
a
flow
regime.
Now ,
this
H
1
and
H
2
that
difference
is
written
in
the
modified
form
of the Darcy Weisbach equation.H
f
= 6.3755 f L  Q
2
D
-5
Where,
H
f
= frictional head loss (m)
f = Darcy’ s frictional factor
L = length of pipe (m)
Q = flow rate (L  h
-1
)
D = internal diameter of pipe (mm)
We already discussed this particular when we were discussing about flow through pipes.
So,
Darcy
Weisbach
equation
as
well
as
Hazen
William’ s
equation
we
have
discussed
in
prior .
And
then,
if
you
remember
this
simply
Darcy
Weisbach
equation
is
Hf
equal
to
f
L
V
square
by
2gD.
So,
that
V
square
term
is
brought
in
terms
of
the
means
Q
square
by
A
square.
And,
A
square
can
be
written
as
pi
D
square
by
4.
So,
this
is
the
modified
form
of
that
component.
It
has
been
brought
means
that
equation
it
is
in
this
form
it
is
written.
Now ,
that
Hf
is
substituted
in
this.
Then,
there
is
equation
which
we
will
use
for
finding
out
this
f.
This
is
a
frictional
factor
f,
will
be
substituted
by
using
the
appropriate
equation
for
the
Reynolds
number .
So,
let
me
just
show
you
that
Reynolds
number
is
given
by
the
4Q
divided
by
this
k.
k
is
a
constant
that
is
equal
to
3600
because
this
unit
is
here
liter
per
hour.
And,
this
eta
is
this
kinematic
viscosity
and
D
is
the
diameter
of
pipeline.
So,
this
way
it
is
given.
And
then,
here
we
know
if
the
flow
is
in
the
turbulent
range
means
fully
turbulent
range
when
we
are
talking. So, Reynolds number is between 4,000 and 10,000.
So,
this
particular
component
we
are
going
to
introduce.
So,
for
turbulent
flow
condition,
we
are
putting
the
appropriate
value
in
the
equation
8.
So,
equation
9,
10,
11
is
substituted
in
equation
8.
So,
what
is
that
equation
8?
I
am
just
bringing
you
back.
This
was
the
equation
8.
So,
this
is
Hf
practically .
So,
this
we
are
putting
H
f
in
terms
of
the
Darcy
Weisbach
equation.
So,
this
equation
we
are
putting
it.
And
then,
we
have
substituted
10
and
11.
By
substituting
the appropriate value of the Reynolds number and equation comes in this form0.465 × Q
c
1.75
=1
𝐷14.75− 1
𝐷24.75⎡⎢⎢⎣⎤⎥⎥⎦𝐷𝐹 𝑥 75 𝑥 3600𝑄𝑢   𝐶𝑊𝐻𝑃
So, from there, actually , this equation it has come from equation 8.
Now ,
assuming
that
the
flow
through
the
unit
is
equal
to
Qu
equal
to
Qc
that
the
flow
through
the
system,
equal
to
critical
flow.
That
particular
equation
12
can
be
converted
in
this
particular
form
for
calculating
the
optimal
flow
between
the
adjacent
diameters.
That
is
D1
and
D
2.
Adjacent
diameter ,
as
I
told
you
that,
what
is
the
next
diameter?
If
not
the
previous
diameter , what is the next diameter?
So,
normally
say
when
we
are
considering
the
main
pipeline,
so,
63
millimeter
is
the
let
us
say
63
millimeter
is
the
internal
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
So,
next
available
diameter
is
75
millimeter .
So,
comparison
is
made
between
the
next
adjacent
diameter
or
75,
75
millimeter
is
nothing
but
3
inch
pipe
size.
So,
it
can
be
3
inch
pipe
size
or
it
can
be
3
and
half
inch.
That
is 90 millimeter . So, like this, we are using dif ferent.
𝑄𝑐 =𝑘1𝑘21
𝐷14.75− 1
𝐷24.75⎡⎢⎢⎣⎤⎥⎥⎦0.3636
So,
Qc
is
converted
in
this
form
by
using
the
equation
12
and
where
it
is
coming
in
the
form
of
the
ratio
of
k1
by
k2.
And
then,
1
minus
D1
to
the
power
4.75
minus
1
by
D2
to
the
power
4.75 where k1 is this expression. k1 is to be obtained by using this expression.
𝑘1 = 𝐷𝐹 ×75 ×3600𝐶𝑊𝐻𝑃
And,
for
a
given
set
of
condition,
k2
becomes
0.465.
So,
optimal
flow
between
2
means
adjacent
pipe
diameter
can
be
obtained
by
using
the
data
on
available
pipe
sizes
which
are
available
in
the
market.
Their
cost,
applicable
bank
interest
rate,
cost
of
the
energy,
hours
of
operation
per
year,
and
overall
pumping
efficiency .
So,
this
way
it
can
be
used
in
finding
out
the optimal flow .
So,
the
equation
13
can
be
written
in
a
generalized
form.
That
is
your
optimal
flow
rate
Qc
can be given by this expression.
𝑄𝑐 = 𝑘1𝑘21

if
means,
there
are
2
cases
it
has
been
considered.
This
is
a
generalized
form
of
the
equation
where
if
I
am
using
say
Darcy
Weisbach
equation,
it
has
a
provision
to
estimate
friction factor f when the flow is laminar , transitional as well as for turbulent flow .
Whereas,
Hazen
Williams
equation,
it
is
used
only
for
a
specific
case.
Means,
there
is
the
value
of
f,
there
is
no
provision
to
change.
So,
normally ,
this
is
for
turbulent
flow
case.
Now ,
here
the
value
of
k2
is
estimated
when
f
is
taken
as
for
laminar
flow
case,
so,
k
2
is
obtained
from
using
the
previous
expression
and
then
corresponding
a
and
b
which
is
there
in
the
expression.
Those
corresponding
values
of
a,
here,
a
is
the
exponent
and
b
is
obtained
for
different
you
know
f
values
and
as
well
as
for
the
C
equal
to
150.
So,
having
got
this
value,
we
can
develop
a curve that I will discuss.
So,
optimal
flows
in
drip
diameter
where
it
requires
means
the
information
related
to
2
adjacent
pipe
sizes,
annual
interest
rate,
how
many
means
operating
hours
in
a
year.
Then,
what
is
the
life
of
the
pipes?
That
is
what
for
PVC
pipeline
and
plastic
pipeline,
normally ,
it
is
40
years
it
is
taken,
an
overall
pumping
efficiency
as
well
as
energy
cost.
So,
if
it
is
a
main
pipeline,
it
is
of
25
to
40
years.
Normally ,
25
years
people
take.
But,
maximum
it
is
given
as
I
was
telling
that
Thompson
table
in
the
previous
class
which
I
told
you
that
when
we
were
estimating
the
depreciation.
So,
there
it
was
considered
as
a
40
years
but
25
years
is
the
period
it
can
be
taken
and
then
number
of
operating
hours
and
year.
So,
this
way
it
is
calculated.
Now ,
life
period
of
pipes
vary
based
on
the
pipe
material.
Hence,
suitable
value
for
the
life
period
is
considered
on
what
is
the
type
of
pipe
material
which
we
are
using
in
the
analysis.
Now ,
details
of
the
pipe
sizes
and
the
unit
cost
is
of
course
these
costs
which
are
available.
These
costs
are
very
old,
pretty
old
means,
it
is
considered
based
on
the
price
which
were
prevailing
price
of
2006
by
Dr.
Yella
Reddy
in
his
PhD
research
work.
He
did
PhD
research
work
at
IIT
Kharagpur
in
the
Department
of
Agriculture
and
Food
Engineering
with
me.
So,
same data, which I am producing here in the year 2006 and same data, it has been used here.So,
given
these
data
and
the
pipe
sizes,
the
critical
flow
values,
which
were
obtained
and
then
a
graph
is
plotted.
When
we
are
considering
the
life
period
of
course
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
considering
10
years.
And
then
the
annual
operating
hours
is
2000
hours.
Annual
interest
rate,
a
general
interest
rate
it
is
taken
as
12%.
Pumping
efficiency
is
65%.
And,
cost
of ener gy is 1 rupee per bhp hours.
So,
you
can
see
here
how
it
is
plotted.
It
is
plotted
for
different
successive
pipeline
and
the
critical
flow
rate.
So,
this
particular
thing
means
this
particular
curve
when
it
is
plotted
it
is
coinciding
when
we
are
considering
the
turbulent
flow
case.
Means,
we
have
taken
a
turbulent
flow
case
and
for
this
turbulent
flow
case
what
we
find
that
the
Hazen
Williams
equation
as
well
as
the
Darcy
Weisbach
equation,
it
is
giving
the
same
values.
Means,
they
are not same value, but almost it is coinciding.
So,
optimal
flows
rates
were
obtained
by
considering
the
successive
pipes
under
turbulent
flow
and
fully
turbulent
range
for
the
Darcy
Weisbach
equation
and
also
with
the
Hazen
Williams equation when we are considering the constant C for the pipeline is 150.
So,
when
we
consider
the
Darcy
Weisbach
equation
for
the
turbulent
flow
optimal
flow
for
the
pipe
size
combination
of
40
to
50
millimeter
is
we
are
getting
the
flow
rate
as
5,085
liter
per
hour.
And,
when
we
consider
say
larger
size
pipeline,
it
is
75
to
90,
we
are
getting
21,049
liter
per
hour.
Now ,
these
values
indicate
the
flow
rate
at
which
the
pipe
has
to
be
means
one
can means the flow rates at which the pipe sizes can be changed.
For
example,
when
we
are
taking
if
the
flow
rate
is
expected
in
pipeline
in
between
13,500
to
this
range,
then
75
millimeter
pipe
size
advisable.
Now ,
when
the
flow
rate
it
exceeds
21,049
liter
per
hour,
then
one
should
use
the
90
millimeter
pipe
size.
So,
in
this
range,
the
smaller
pipeline
can
be
taken
but
when
it
exceeds
the
value
than
the
higher
size,
it
is
recommended
when
we
are
considering
the
optimal
flow
criteria.
So,
optimal
flow
criteria
provides
a
useful
information for selecting the pipe size of the pressurized irrigation system.
Now ,
in
order
to
use
this
economic
means
this
particular
criteria,
so,
a
hypothetical
example
has
been
taken,
where
the
drip
system
has
been
considered
for
6
hectare
Banana
crop.
Andthen,
the
data
which
has
been
used
for
this
study ,
spacing
is
considered
as
2
meter
by
2
meter
and this 6 hectare area it has a length of 400 meter and width of 150 meter . It is a flat terrain.
We
have
considered
it
is
a
medium
textured
sandy
loam
soil.
And
then,
the
peak
evapotranspiration
rate
is
9.75
millimeter
per
day
of
course,
this
is
a
considerable
very
high
value
normally .
This
evaporation
rate
in
our
country
it
is
rare,
but
it
is
a
hypothetical
question
that
were
to
make
you
understand
about
this
particular
thing.
So,
this
is
not
exactly
it
is
happening in our case.
Normally
in
our
country ,
the
evaporation
rate
it
is
varying
from
maximum
it
goes
up
to
6
to
7
millimeter
per
day.
And
well
is
a
source,
means,
well,
it
is
taken
as
a
groundwater
and
static
water
level
is
8
meter .
Emission
uniformity ,
it
considered
as
a
90%.
And
then
there
is
a
limiting
velocity .
This
is
the
value
where
maximum
velocity
it
is
recommended
by
American
Society
of
Agriculture
Engineers
that
in
the
pipe
flow,
particularly
for
drip
irrigation
pipeline,
the velocity should not exceed more than 1.5 meter per second.
The
other
cases
here
you
can
see
here
we
are
we
have
taken
the
lateral
pipeline,
sub
main
pipeline,
main
pipeline
of
these
sizes
and
then
their
corresponding.
So,
lateral
pipeline,
it
is
given
as
a
Dl
10,
Dl
12,
and
Dl
16.
Dl
means
diameter
of
lateral
pipeline
of
10
millimeter ,
12
millimeter ,
16
millimeter .
Though
cost
it
is
less,
now,
this
prevailing
cost
at
present
means
these
are
the
cost
which
were
assumed.
Means,
these
were
taken
15
years
back.
So,
these
costs
are
considerably
very
low,
but
it
will
go
high.
Then,
in
case
of
sub
main
pipeline,
the
pipe
sizes
were
the
50
millimeter ,
40
millimeter ,
then
50
millimeter ,
63
millimeter .
And
main
pipeline, it has been taken 75 and 90 millimeter .
And
as
I
told
you
that
this
is
the
field
size
of
400
meter
by
150
millimeter ,
which
is
6
hectare
area.
And,
there
is
1
dripper
of
4
liter
per
capacity
to
each
plant
it
has
been
given.
And,
these
are
other
information
the
total
number
of
plant
for
6
hectare
area
is
14,800.
And
then,
one
row
it
is
kept
in
the
middle
so,
that
easy
operation
for
operating
the
subunits
can
be
made.
Means,
suppose
it
is
manually
operated
system
then
one
has
to
go
and
operate
the
valve
etcetera.
Now ,
considering
all
the
14,800
plants
and
4
liters
of
water
per
hour,
so,
the
dischar ge
requirement
is
59,200
liter
per
hour.
It
is
also
considered
that
the
flow
in
the
mainpipeline
when
we
are
considering
this
dischar ge,
the
flow
velocity
it
is
coming
2.59
meter
per
second, which is higher than the required.
So,
we
need
to
take
consider
such
velocity
which
is
given
as
suggested
by
American
Society
of
Agricultural
Engineer .
And,
from
the
market
available,
these
are
sizes
it
has
been
considered.
And,
in
order
to
means
not
to
operate
all
the
lateral
lines.
So,
there
are
arrangement
it
has
been
made
that
it
can
be
considered
too.
So,
means
there
are
2
irrigation
plan it has been suggested. So, half of the field it will there.
So,
you
can
see
here
the
layout
it
has
been
made.
So,
here,
layout
it
goes
like
this.
This
is
the
source
of
water .
And,
from
the
source
of
water ,
there
is
a
pump.
And,
pump
is
connected
with
the
main
pipeline.
So,
pipeline
goes
from
the
middle
of
the
field.
And
then,
these
are
the
sub
main
unit.
And
then,
with
these
sub
main
units,
the
lateral
pipelines
are
attached.
Total,
you
can see here there are total 8 subunits. Means, there are total 8 plots or 8 subunits.
So,
1,
2,
3,
4
on
this
side
and
then
5,
6,
7,
8
on
this
side
and
this
particular
sub
main
which
is
there
it
is
supplying
water
up
to
this
part.
So,
there
will
be
here
valve,
it
will
be
closed
when
we
are
going
to
apply
water
to
the
subunit.
This
particular
plot
5
or
we
will
be
again
I
mean
so,
all
these
subunits
are
given
valves
to
operate.
So,
this
is
the
arrangement,
the
other
details
are available in the problem.
Now ,
as
there
are
2
irrigation
plan
which
has
been
suggested.
One
irrigation
plan,
that
irrigating
subunits
1,
2,
3,
4
in
one
shift.
So,
from
here
this
is
the
middle
part.
And
then
these
are
the
4
subunits
being
irrigated
and
then
5,
6,
7,
8
is
another
shift.
Like
this
there
are
the
other one is giving irrigation to 1, 2, 7, 8, means this part and 3, 4, 5, 6 in the another shift.
So,
there
could
be
2
arrangements.
And,
optimal
flow
rates
are
computed
for
successive
pipes.
And
then
these
are
the
data
which
has
been
considered.
That
is
the
life
period
is
10
years,
interest
rate
12%
and
these
are
the
other
data
which
already
I
have
told
you.
So,
in
order
to
study
the
effect
of
time
of
operation
on
optimal
flow,
the
analysis
has
been
made
by
considering
the
time
of
operation
in
a
year.
That
is
500
to
2,500
by
taking
the
interval
of
500
hours.So,
here,
we
can
see
that
these
are
the
operating
hours.
And,
when
we
are
considering
the
optimal
flows,
estimated
or
given
in
the
table
where
this
indicate
the
flow
rate
at
which
the
pipe
diameters
can
be
changed
from
lower
to
higher
or
the
consequent
pipe
size
of
63
millimeter to 75 millimeter and 75 to 90 millimeter . So, this way , we are getting the values.
And
then,
these
values
at
which
the
optimal
flows
are
obtained.
So,
what
we
say
let
us
say
that
it
is
the
when
we
are
considering
the
2,000
hours
of
operation,
the
pipe
size
required
to
be
changed
from
63
millimeter
to
75
millimeter
when
flow
in
the
network
exceeds
13,520
liter
per
hour.
Similarly ,
the
pipe
size
has
to
be
changed
from
75
to
90
millimeter
means
particularly
at
the
flow
rate
when
it
exceeds
21,048
liter
per
hour.
Here,
this
has
been
converted to liter per second. Means, liter per hour is converted to liter per second.
So,
design
of
main
pipeline
means
there
is
another
criteria.
That
was
from
the
optimal
flow
criteria
and
when
we
are
making
the
velocity
as
the
criteria,
so,
means
the
limiting
velocity
is
taken
as
1.5
meter
per
second
as
per
the
recommendation
of
ASAE.
So,
flow
velocity
in
the
main
pipeline
for
different
flow
rates.
So,
when
we
are
considering
63
millimeter
pipe
size,
so, we will find out the area under this pipeline.
And
when
we
have
got
different
expected
flow
rate,
so,
we
will
get
different
velocities
for
the
different
sizes
of
the
pipeline.
63
millimeter
pipeline,
so,
this
we
are
getting
0.66
meter
per
second.
And
then,
when
we
go
for
the
higher
flow
rate,
the
velocity
it
comes
to
this
one.
Now ,
when
we
go
for
the
further
higher
flow
rate,
we
find
that
63
millimeter
pipeline
it
will
be
exceeding
the
velocity
limit
of
1.5
millimeter
per
second.
Then,
one
should
think
of
another
pipe
size
that
would
be
the
higher
pipe
size.
Similarly ,
for
the
other
pipelines.
So,
these are the values one can select by considering the velocity criteria.
So,
in
calculating
the
pipe
sizes
for
the
maximum
flow
expected
to
each
zone,
has
been
considered.
We
are
assuming
means
there
are
some
other
assumption
which
is
given
that
the
length
of
pipeline,
when
we
are
connecting
with
the
source
of
power ,
is
10
meter .
And,
the
2
irrigation
plan
which
I
have
already
discussed
you
how
these
to
be
operated
in
shift
1
and
shift 2.And,
when
we
are
using
the
irrigation
plan
say
1,
the
requirements
of
the
pipe
were
100
meter
pipe
of
63
millimeter ,
then
100
meter
pipe
size
of
75
millimeter ,
110
meter
of
the
90
millimeter
pipe
size
means
considering
when
we
are
using
the
optimal
flow
criteria.
And,
with
irrigation
plan
2,
when
we
are
considering,
so,
these
are
the
dimensions
which
we
are
getting
for
these
2
pipe
means
your
other
plan,
so,
though
estimates
were
also
based
on
the
taking the each segment.
Now ,
estimates
are
made
for
the
irrigation
plan
assuming
3,
4,
5,
6
subunits
are
to
be
irrigated
in
one
shift.
So,
the
segment
of
pipe
carrying
water
to
the
subunit
4,
5
should
carry
this
much
amount
of
flow.
That
is
14,800
liter
and
should
be
of
this
diameter .
I
mean
100
meter
long
pipeline
of
75
millimeter .
Then,
the
entire
area
for
3,
4,
5,
6,
these
are
the
pipeline
which
has
been suggested based on the optimal flow criteria when we are using.
And
accordingly ,
the
cost
were
estimated.
And
then,
what
we
find?
The
cost
of
the
main
pipeline
when
we
are
using
I
1
plan,
and
I
2
plan
what
we
find
that
the
there
is
a
net
saving
in
the
rupees
of
2,770
by
adopting
,using
the
plan
I
1
over
I
2.
So,
I
1
is
more
successful
when
we
are
taking
the
optimal
flow
criteria.
Now ,
this
indicate
the
selection
of
irrigation
pipe
is
an
important aspect to optimize the pipe requirement.
Then,
the
estimates
which
has
been
made
for
the
different
length
of
the
pipeline
on
the
basis
of
optimal
flow
criteria
and
velocity
criteria.
We
have
taken
both
the
criteria
when
we
are
comparing.
So,
what
we
find
that
the,
this
is
the
combination
when
we
are
using
for
63
millimeter
pipeline
of
100
meters,
75
millimeter
of
100
meter ,
90
mi.
So,
this
way
is
the
total
cost
it
comes
to
1,242.
Whereas,
velocity
criteria
it
is
giving
9282
when
for
the
irrigation
plan
1.
Similarly ,
in
case
of
irrigation
plan
2,
the
total
cost
come
to
14,000.
And,
in
this
case,
it
is
coming 13,722 rupees.
So,
this
way
one
can
compare.
So,
comparison
is
made
taking
the
different
pipe
sizes
and
also
by
using
the
2
different
criteria.
That
is
optimal
flow
criteria
and
velocity
flow
criteria,
so,
maximum
velocity
criteria.
So,
what
we
are
finding
that
the
frictional
head
loss
in
the
main
pipeline
is
estimated
by
considering
the
total
flow
which
is
taking
place
in
each
zone.Annual
cost
of
the
mainline
was
more
for
the
larger
pipe
size
and
however ,
the
annual
operating
cost
it
becomes
less
because
the
frictional
cost
or
energy
requirement
is
less.
So,
total
annual
cost
considered
for
the
purpose
of
comparison
the
by
pipe
size
combination
with
the
lower
annual
costs
are
better
for
selection.
In
all
irrigation
plans
the
optimal
flow
criteria
proves to be more economical.
Now ,
in
calculating
the
horsepower
requirement,
constant
of
2
meter
of
head
in
accessories
and
8
meter
for
the
suction
head
which
is
given
in
the
question
that
has
been
added.
And
then,
we
are
taking
the
10
meter
as
the
pressure
head
to
operate
the
drippers.
And,
total
head
requirement estimated to be 20 plus frictional losses in the main pipeline.
So,
in
all
the
cases,
optimal
flow
criteria
proves
to
be
requiring
less
horsepower
to
operate
prime
mover
than
uniform
size
of
63
and
75
millimeter
size.
So,
use
of
uniform
size
of
D
90
would
need
less
prime
mover
size,
but
annual
cost
of
the
pipe
would
be
much
higher
than
those
selected
with
optimal
flow
criteria.
So,
this
shows
that
optimal
flow
criteria
should
be
the basis for pipe selection, in selection of mainline, in drip irrigation system design.
So,
this
is
the
comparison
which
I
have
told
you
that
when
we
are
considering
the
optimal
flow
criteria,
the
energy
cost
and
then
annual
fixed
cost,
the
horsepower
requirement
of
the
prime
mover .
So,
this
is
all
it
is
lesser
than
the
velocity
flow,
velocity
criteria,
when
we
are
taking it. So, it is you can see here this is 2,961.5 rupees where this comes to 2,999.5 rupees.
So,
like
this
here
also
you
can
see
it
is
lesser
than
the
velocity ,
maximum
velocity
criteria.
So,
this is giving optimal result.
So,
let
us
summarize
this
part
the
optimal
flow
criteria
and
Life
Cycle
Costing
technique
have
been
used
for
the
development
of
equation
for
finding
out
the
economical
pipe
size.
The
model
equation
developed
was
based
on
both
economic
as
well
as
hydraulic
consideration.
It
estimate
the
flow
rate
at
which
the
designers
should
change
from
one
size
to
another
pipe
size.
We
have
taken
an
example
for
implementing
in
6
hectare
area
for
the
comparison
purpose.
And
then,
we
found
that
the
annual
cost
was
lowest
when
we
are
using
the
optimal
flow criteria. In all the irrigation plan optimal flow criteria was found to be economical.So,
this
is
the
summary
part
which
I
told.
And
then,
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
again
discuss
about
the
economic
analysis
of
micro
irrigation
system.
That
will
be

3
