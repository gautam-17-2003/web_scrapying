Drip Irrigation: Design Considerations and System Layout 
 
Hello participants, I welcome you to lecture 24. Lecture 24 is on drip irrigation design 
consideration and system layout. In lecture 23, we discussed about drip irrigation system. We 
learned about the different components of a drip irrigation system. Now, having learned 
about the different components of drip irrigation system, we are interested to use this system , 
install the system in the field, we should have prior information. We should design the 
system. It should be hydraulically efficient. It should be economical and then find out the 
suitable layout as per the field requirement.  
 
So, in this lecture, we are going to cover the points needed for the planning of a drip 
irrigation system. After knowing the information available, having the resource inventory 
done, then we will take up what are the general points which are needed for designing a drip 
irrigation system, wetting pattern, percent wetted area by the particular type of drip emitter or 
set up, group of drip emitters, how to determine crop water requirement, and finalizing the 
layout of drip system.  
 
When we talk of drip irrigation system design, our aim is to achieve higher irrigation 
efficiency means, we are interested to get high emission uniformity from the drip emitters. 
And this is only possible when our system is perfectly hydraulically designed and the 
drippers are properly chosen. They are free from any problems related to clogging, then only 
we can achieve high emission uniformity.  
 
Our aim is to maintain optimum soil moisture levels for optimal crop yield. So, it should not 
over irrigate; it should not under irrigate. So, the moisture content is a very important 
parameter which will help in the plant growth, and ultimately, it will result in getting the high 
crop yield. To keep both initial investment and annual cost at a minimum level. This is a very 
important thing when we are deciding particular design and layout.  
 So, we have to see that the investment, there should be minimum attachment within the 
system and also, see that annual cost which is matter. So, if it is properly designed, we will be 
getting the annual cost reduced. So, we should aim for this point also. The other point is to 
design a suitable type of system, which will last long and also, for the longer time period, life 
period of the system, it should perform at high efficiency. It should perform well.  
 
The other point is to design a manageable system which can be easily operated and 
maintained. Yes, designs should be user-friendly, anybody who wants to use it, then they can 
be properly operated and easily maintained. This is for any designs; not only for drip system  
but this would be easily operated and maintained, then only it is an efficient design.  
 
To satisfy and fulfill the need of crops, yes, the design should meet the crop water 
requirement; it should meet the fertigation requirement means it should have the adequate 
capacity of the pump, the adequate capacity of the fertigation unit, adequate capacity of th e 
all other systems, which have been used as the components and then also finally, it helps to 
fulfill the requirement of the user, crop grower or farmers.  
 
Now, what are the different steps one should follow when we are taking for the design of a 
micro irrigation system? So, the first most thing is that one should make the inventory of 
resources. What are the resources? This means, what is the type of soil, what is the land 
elevation, what is the source of water, whether the source of water is adequate, what is the 
quality of water, etc. So, these are some points that come under the resource inventory and 
then we should collect those data, analyze them carefully that will become an input when we 
are taking design.  
 
Computation of peak water requirement. Computation of peak water requirement, if we are 
able to get the water requirement of the crop during peak season, peak demand, or during 
summer month when we are considering means our system design is a conservative design 
which will take care of all season.  
 
When a crop is at the initial stage, when it is in the maturity stage, when it is at the l ate 
season's stage so, peak design will take care of that. Deciding the appropriate layout of the 
system, this is in the topic, we will discuss about what would be the appropriate layout one should follow. Then choosing drip emitters. So, having got the type of soil, having got the 
particular type of crop, then we will choose an appropriate emitter and its capacity.  
 
Hydraulic design of the system in terms of lateral means to design for lateral, design for sub-
main, design for main pipeline and then finally, we will estimate what is the total pressure 
requirement, what will be the total water requirement, then we will get the horsepower 
requirement of the pump.  
 
Now, going little detail about the inventory of the resources and data collection means we 
need to have the scale plan of site means map of the place that is the location map where the 
irrigation area is to be irrigated. So, what is the area it is there? And then what is the 
topography elevation? What is the highest elevation in the field? Because that will be needed 
while we are finding out the head requirement.  
 
Irrigation water source, is it a surface water or groundwater? Then whether the quantity of 
water which is available, is it adequate to meet the requirement? Because this we will be 
considering for that period when crop is in the peak growth stage means peak requirements. 
So, whether that much water will be available. So, one is that peak water requirement on 
daily basis, then total water requirement for the whole season and then what is the quality of 
water.  
 
How much is the sand, silt, and clay? And then the other you know the anion, cation, which 
they are in the water, can it be separated? That should be analyzed before we are thinking of a 
drip irrigation system. Soil type means what is the texture. What type of soil it is there? 
Accordingly, we will choose a particular type of emitter.  
 
Local climatic data, weather data, it is important. So, weather data analysis will be done. W e 
discussed about crop evapotranspiration in the basic fundamental part of this course, 
regarding estimation of evapotranspiration requirement of the crop, reference 
evapotranspiration, this already I have discussed. So, that will be needed using the data and in 
the previous slide, I was telling the peak water requirement ET 0, daily it is needed for 
operating the system, but ET0 particularly during peak season or during summer month 
maybe for some crop will be needed.  
 Then the proposed planting, what type of crop or a plant? And then what is the spacing 
between the crops? What is the type of crop? And then what is the initial or your maturity 
stage of the crop? So, all these are to be needed. 
 
Then, I told you about the quality of water. So, quality of water, we will need that what is the 
type of filter we will be needing. Whether 2 filters are adequate, one filter itself is adequate,  
or for all 3, 4 types of filter will be needed that will be decided based on the quality of water  
available. And we said then, if I am taking a filter, it should give a high filtration efficiency. 
It should not get clogged. There should be a minimum head loss due to filter elements. So, we 
will take care of the chemical quality of water, what is the secondary safety about the 
screening, then the other part is your pressure variation, pressure due to the filter, pressure 
variation due to elevation in the field.  
 
What is the operating pressure which is needed for the particular emission device that is to be 
used that can be operated, degree of control of pressure? This is another component that 
should be taken care and then one should know the discharge pressure relationship means 
when we are considering what is the discharge needed, how much pressure it needed. So, 
accordingly, a hydrant will be placed, your line should be connected with them with a source 
of water. So, that it is delivering an appropriate discharge and then we should have a 
provision to monitor the flow rate. We should have provision to monitor the pressure at 
different points.  
 
The other point which I was telling you in previous class about the wetting by a dripper. It 
forms an onion shape or it forms the elliptical shape. So, that is the wetting pattern. What 
type of wetting forms when the water is being supplied by a dripper? So, it means the water 
will wet in a horizontal or a vertical direction.  
 
So, you can see here, when water is being given by one point source drip emitter, the 
horizontal spread of water is more as compared to the vertical spread of water. This happens 
when water is being given with the dripper in clay soil. In loamy soil, the shape you know, 
the volume of water is the same, which has been given, but it has taken a different shape. 
When you come to the sandy soil, the vertical moment of water is more as compared to the 
horizontal movement. So, this kind of situation happens when we are considering a particular 
type of dripper . So, we will work out the wetting pattern. Wetting pattern, we will estimate in terms of percent weighted area. Now, the percentage weighted area compared to the entire 
cropped area depends on the volume, rate of discharge at each emission point, the spacing of 
emission point, and the type of soil.  
 
I would say that it is the soil, it is the particular type of dripper, and the time of application of 
water that will be important while the horizontal as well as vertical movement of water from 
the point source emitter when the water moment, it takes place. So, Pw is determined from an 
estimate of average area, weighted at a depth of 15 to 30 centimeter beneath the emitter  that 
is divided by the total cropped area served.  
 
So, we can see here system having high Pw provides more storage of water means that will 
be the thing that that how much is the Pw percentage wetting area provide s more storage of 
water. So far, wider spacing crops, Pw should be between, a practical value I am telling you, 
30% to 70%. Now, 30% what I am telling, this is when the horticulture crop when it is in the 
initial growth stage and it goes to 70% when it is in the fully grown stage.  
 
So, when we are designing the system, one should take about 60 to 70%. In that range, this 
should be taken, it is given below 67% to keep strips between rows dry for cultural practice. 
Now, low Pw reduces the loss of water. It is correct, if lesser will be the wetting means, the 
loss will be low, evaporation will be low, and means where the cover crops are used.  
 
Now, it is costly to have a low Pw for more emitters, and tubings are required. When we need 
to have more Pw when we want to so, then what will happen? We will be using drippers , 
these are your tubings wherein the inline type of dripper are used, so that one complete strip 
can be made. So, closely spaced crop with the rows and emitter lateral less than 1.8 meter, the 
percentage weighted area approaches to 100; means when the closely spaced crop, we ar e 
considering a vegetable crop, their wetting is maintained at 100%. And on sloping land, the 
wetting pattern may be distorted due to the effect of the slope.  
 
Now, we want to find out how to get the value of Pw that is the percent wetting area. So, this 
can be estimated by,  
𝑃𝑤= 𝑁𝑝𝑆𝑒𝑤
𝑆𝑝𝑆𝑟×100    Where, Np is the number of emitters per tree, Se the spacing of emitters in the lateral, w 
wetting width, Sp is the plant spacing, and Sr is the spacing between the rows. So, this way, 
one can find out for the single lateral system.  
 
Now, when we are finding out particularly for micro sprinkler or spray types of emitter, then 
one can find out the percentage wetting.  
𝑃𝑤= 𝑁𝑝[𝐴𝑝+(𝑆𝑒×𝑃𝑆)2⁄]
𝑆𝑝𝑆𝑟×100    
Where Ap is the soil surface area directly wetted by sprayers, Ps is the perimeter of the area 
directly weighted by sprayers . So, this will give for when we are considering the spray 
system or micro sprinkler system wetting area, one can calculate.  
 
This is a study which has been reported by James in 1998, that the maximum diameter of a 
weighted circle that is formed by a single emitter device when it is discharging about 4 litre 
per hour for various soils. You can see here if it is a coarse soil, it is a homogeneous coarse 
soil, the water movement is 45 centimeter; in case of varying layers, it is wetting bulb is 75 
centimeter diameter and when it is a varying layer, generally having medium density 110 
centimeter.  
 
So, as we go for the varying layers means it is a layer ed kind of system it did exist. When 
there is medium density soil it exists, what we find is that the wetting bulb or wetting 
diameter Aw, it is more as compared to the other areas. So, this is the way it is estimated. 
And you can see how a typical, means, there are 2 laterals which are spaced and then how the 
particular drip emitter is discharging.  
 
So, here, what you are seeing, this is the spacing between the drip lateral. So, we need to see 
that there is a proper overlap of this wetting bulb which has been formed by the drip emitter. 
So, that the effective root zone depth of the plant is irrigated.  
 
Now, computing the irrigation water requirement. As we have learn ed in the previous same 
concept that is used here also. Irrigation water requirement is the amount of water in addition 
to the rainfall that must be applied to meet the crop water evapotranspiration without 
reduction in the yield. So, crop water requirement under drip irrigation system, it will vary with the different crops. Under surface and sprinkler irrigation, primarily the land area-
weighted is reduced resulting in less evaporation from the soil surface.  
 
So, the peak water requirement, we can give here  
𝑄 =𝐸𝑇𝑜× 𝐾 𝑐× 𝑆𝑝× 𝑆𝑟× 𝑊 𝑎  
 
Where ET 0 is the reference evapotranspiration in millimeter per day, Kc is the crop 
coefficient, the area under each plant that is the spacing between the plant, Sp, and the 
spacing between the rows, Sr of these plants, wa is percent weighted area. The same thing, it 
is a Pw. It is Pw. It is the area of each individual plant and this is the ETc. This, already we 
have studied the ETc. ETo into Kc is actual crop evapotranspiration.  
 
So, this way now, ET0 is, though it is written here, it is reference evapotranspiration, but we 
need to get ET0 value for peak requirement when there is a high demand of atmosphere, it is 
there that will cause the more ET0 values that mean temperature, solar radiation, wind, they 
are active then only ET0, means it is that particular crop, there is no shortage of moisture and 
then it is at the full growth stage.  
 
Now, when we want to find out the capacity of drip irrigation system, so, it is necessary to 
determine the system capacity, operating time per season to design a pumping plant, and 
pipeline network that are economical and efficient. According to Keller and Bliesner in 1990, 
they have given this expression to estimate the capacity of drip irrigation system. The 
capacity of the drip irrigation system, which is nothing but the total quantity of water or 
discharge to be supplied by the pump. So, it is given by  
𝑄𝑠= 𝐾𝐴×𝑞
𝑁𝑠×𝑆𝑒×𝑆𝑙  
Where A is the area of the field, q is the discharge of a particular emitter, Ns is the number of 
operating hours, the row to row spacing that is the spacing between the plant/emitter, Se, and 
then Sl is the spacing between the lateral. So, we will get the value of the particular area, how 
much area is to irrigate the plant means the particular area between each individual plant and 
then total area and the discharge is known, divided by the operating hours. Then one can 
know that what will be the discharge. So, this will give the total system capacity.  
 Now, here time of operation is another component. Time of operation means how many hours 
the system should be operated. So, having got , if we know the volume of water supply 
needed (V), that volume, we will get based on the what number of plants and its ET0 value 
means area multiplied by the ET0 multiplied by the number of plants that will give this thing 
and then that is divided by the q.  
T =𝑉
Ne×Np×q  
So, this will give us the total time of operation of the drip system.  
 
Now, the capacity of the drip system can be verified means, can be estimated by using that 
flow carried by the lateral, the discharge of one emitter multiplied by the number of drippers 
or emitters in each lateral. Flow carried by the sub-main pipeline is the number of lateral in 
each submission pipeline multiplied by a discharge of one lateral. So, this is a Q L multiplied 
by the number of lateral. Similarly, the discharge carried by the main pipeline is the discharge 
of one sub-main manifold multiplied by the number of the sub-main pipeline.  
 
Now, each drip irrigation system should be, can be laid in different ways depending on the 
source of water supply, depending on the field layout. So, it is possible to apply water to the 
whole field by drip system method at the same time. As far as possible, of course, it will if 
the area is very large, one can divide the area into a number of zones, but for a smaller area,  
one can give water at all the points.  
 
So, this is the way that when it is given, water is being brought from the source of supply, 
main is laid just to parallel to the width and then directly on the main lateral pipeline has been 
attached. So, this is one kind of layout when it is a small area where sub-mains are not used . 
This could be another way that when the area is having divided, the main pipeline is brought 
to the cent er of the field and then on either side lateral pipelines which have been attached. 
This is also possible when your area is small. We did not have a sub-main pipeline. So, the 
field needs to be divided into a number of sub-unit. So, this could be a different arrangement, 
here, what we are seeing is the main pipeline is laid and then sub-main pipelines have been 
attached. So, we can divide depending on how much the width and then the total number of 
plants and what is the total area, it is there.  
 Then, this is one kind of arrangement, which we are seeing that so the layout will depend 
upon the field requirement and layout of the field. So, each sub-unit is then designed 
separately and operated separately having a valve at the head of the sub-unit. So, when I am 
telling about, this is the one case, what happened the main pipeline it comes to the cent er and 
then sub-main pipeline and from this sub-main pipeline, laterals have been attached. So, here, 
there are 2 sub-mains. One sub-main line goes this side. Another sub-main goes this side and 
this sub-main line, there is a gate valve attached. So, system layout will depend upon the 
shape of the field, area of the field, source of water supply, now, if everything is open to us 
and the well has to be dug so, it is better, that the source of water supply is to be in the middle 
of the field. So, that the cost of bringing water and attaching the main pipeline can be 
reduced.  
 
Now, the number of sub-main can be decided, this is one criterion that total time available for 
irrigation divided by the time of operation of the drip system. So, we got the time of 
operation of the drip system, but the total time available will depend upon the number of 
electricity available in the region. This is another point that the number of hours when the 
electricity is available, accordingly, one has to see. 
 
And accordingly, the number of sub-units, number of valves that can be operated. The layout 
of the drip system that is the arrangement of main, sub-main, lateral, is done considering the 
shape of the field, this already I have told you, size of the field and slope that which direction 
the mains should run, which direction laterals should run. As far as possible sub-mains should 
run along the slope of the field and laterals should be laid across the slope or along the 
contour line of the field.  
 
So, you can see here, this is the arrangement. It is shown here. There is one lateral and then in 
between the se crop rows are being grown. So, here, we see that lateral lines are kept between 
the rows of the plant. You can see here, that according to the rows of the plant, each 
independent one line per row, it goes adjust to the rows the laterals are laid. So, this will 
happen upon depending on the plant water requirement and then field arrangement.  
 
This is the another case. There are 2 lines per row means when the plant is aged, the water 
requirement is high. In that case, for orchard crop, perennial crop with the water requirement 
is high, we can have 2 lines of the lateral for each row. This is one arrangement. The other one, we are seeing it in between the 2 rows, 1 lateral goes. So, this kind of arrangement, it is 
used.  
 
So, we can see here, dripper is attached with the lateral. Here, these are the drippers and then 
in between the 2 rows. These are the 2 rows. There is one lateral, it goes. So, these 2 rows, 
the one lateral goes. This is the type of arrangement and then this means one dripper per plant 
and then paired row can be there, 2 drippers per plant means water requirement is very high.  
 
Or there can be 4 drippers for each plant, where another tune is attached with the main lateral 
means your lateral pipeline of 16 millimeter, then there is a connector from this connector, 
the 10 millimeter or 12 millimeter lateral is attached and that make circular and then 
irrigation is being given. So, laterals are to be laid as per the plant configuration, field 
configuration that can be made.  
 
So, here, the same thing which I have explained, this is given. Again it is repeated once the 
field layout is finalized diameter, length of sub-main pipeline, laterals for each unit are 
decided based on the hydraulic design of the pipeline. The spacing between the lateral 
depends on the crop geometry and row crops. For plantation or orchard crop, spacing 
between laterals is equal to the row spacing.  
 
However, depending on the age of the tree, tree spacing and soil type, 2 drippers per row of 
the tree may be needed. This is what I was telling you. This kind of thing, it will happen 
particularly for orchard crops, which is aged and its water requirement is high. The spacing 
between the emitter on lateral for row crops is governed by soil type, where, in the case of 
plantation or tree crops, the number of emitters per tree is governed by the spacing, age, soil 
type. And also, one thing I want to tell here is that yes, the emitter is important, but when it is 
a very too close crop, then simply giving 1 dripper or 2 drippers, it is better to use micro 
sprinkler, so, that the wetting can be made for particularly for close  growing crops.  
 
So, we discussed all these topics.Now, you can have the closure detail, more details about 
this particular topic by referring to these books. This is a very important book which we can 
have, then you can have Larry James ’ book, Michael A M book. So, the se books, you can 
refer for more details. 
  
So, let us summarise this particular lecture. We discussed about the points which are used for 
the design of drip irrigation system, what should be the points that should be considered 
while we are designing the system. We discussed about wetting patterns and the wetting 
pattern it depends on the different types of soil and then the amount of water which is 
discharging from a dripper and then the time of application.  Crop water requirement and 
system layout were also, we discussed.  
 
Now, in the forthcoming lecture, we will discuss about the different types of drip emitters and 
how to select a particular type of drip emitter. So, thank you very much.
