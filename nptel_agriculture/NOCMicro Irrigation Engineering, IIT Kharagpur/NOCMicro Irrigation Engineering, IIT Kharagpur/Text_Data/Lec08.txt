Crop Coefficient and Cr op Water Requir ement
Hello,
dear
participants
of
this
course,
I
welcome
you
to
lecture
8.
In
this
lecture,
we
will
discuss
about
crop
coefficient
and
crop
water
required.
In
the
previous
lecture,
lectures
6,
7
we
discussed
about
evapotranspiration
and
we
estimated
evapotranspiration
by
using
reference
crop
evapotranspiration
and
crop
coefficient.
We
were
estimating
reference
evapotranspiration
and
multiplying with the crop coef ficient to determine actual crop evapotranspiration.
But
sometimes
when
we
are
using
Lysimeter
or
we
are
using
FAO
56
method
and
in
Lysimeter
if
we
have
grown
a
reference
crop
where
we
are
maintaining
ideal
condition
means
there
is
no
deficiency
in
soil
moisture
content
when
it
is
covering
the
entire
ground
and
it
is
grown
with
grass. So, whatever amount of water is evapotranspired by the grass or reference crop is ET
0
.
And
actual
evapotranspiration
of
the
crop
in
another
Lysimeter
in
the
adjacent
condition
is
maintained.
So,
one
can
get
the
crop
coefficient
value
by
using
the
actual
evapotranspiration
of
the
given
crop
divided
by
the
reference
evapotranspiration,
reference
crop
evapotranspiration,
or
potential
evapotranspiration.
So,
one
can
get
crop
coefficient
value.
Now ,
we
will
discuss
in
detail in this lecture 8 about crop coef ficient.
Now ,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
will
discuss
about
single
crop
coefficient
which
is
a
very
which
has
been
in
majority
of
the
literature,
it
is
being
used
single
crop
coefficient.
Dual
crop
coefficient
very
limited
work
or
information
is
available.
But
particularly
for
micro-irrigation,
this
is
very
relevant.
So,
let
us
try
to
know
what
did
you
do
well
with
crop
coefficient
and
how
it
can
be
utilized,
and
how
it
can
be
determined.
Water
requirement
of
a
crop,
different
crops,
is
another important thing for irrigation planning.So,
we
will
be
discussing
about
water
requirement
of
different
crops.
So,
let
us
know
what
is
the
crop
coefficient?
So,
crop
coefficient
is
when
we
are
calculating
ET
c
that
is
crop
evapotranspiration,
we
are
multiplying
reference
crop
evapotranspiration
with
K
c
,
it
gives
the
value
of
actual
crop
evapotranspiration.
Now ,
ET
o
of
grass
means
the
reference
crop
means
it
is
the
crop
which
is
used
as
the
reference
crop
which
is
usually
you
know
ideal
crop
where
ideal
situations.
ùê∏ùëá ùëê=ùê∏ùëá ùëú√óùêæùëê
Like
well
water
condition
etc.
is
maintained
when
this
particular
crop
water
is
you
know
from
the
atmosphere
the
demand
of
the
atmosphere,
the
energy
provided
by
the
atmosphere
it
is
used.
It
is
providing
the
energy
for
evapotranspiration.
So,
the
amount
of
water
evapotranspired
by
the
reference
crop
is
ET
0
.
And
this
ET
0
when
we
multiplied
with
the
K
c
factor
our
crop
coefficient,
it
gives
the
actual
evapotranspiration
of
the
crop.
So,
K
c
is
one
need
to
determine
what
is
the
K
c
value?
Now ,
why
crop
coefficient
approach
is
important?
ET
0
represents
an
index
of
climatic
demand
means
reference
evapotranspiration,
basically ,
it
is
influenced
by
the
atmospheric
parameters.
K
c
varies
predominantly
with
the
crop
characteristics.
So,
ET
0
climatic
demand
and
then
the
crop
characteristics
at
the
K
c
,
it
is
influenced
by
the
crop
characteristics.
It
is
only
limited
to
a
certain
extent, it is only limited with the climate.
It
means
very
limited
means
not
much
influence
of
the
climate
at
there,
but
mainly
it
is
the
crop
characteristics.
And
this
enables
the
transfer
of
standard
values
of
the
crop
coefficient
between
location
and
climate.
So,
means
a
particular
place
where
the
crop
is
being
grown
and
then
what
is
the
climatic
situation
it
exists
this
makes
the
change
in
the
value
of
the
crop
coefficient.
And
this
is
the
primary
reason
for
the
global
acceptance
and
usefulness
of
the
crop
coefficient
approach has been you know considered to determine the actual crop evapotranspiration.The
crop
coefficient
is
the
ratio
of
actual
crop
evapotranspiration
which
we
call
ET
c
to
the
reference
evapotranspiration.
It
is
the
ratio
of
ET
c
to
the
ET
0
and
it
represents
the
integration
of
four
primary
characteristics.
What
are
those
four
primary
characteristics?
One
is
crop
height
and
the
other
one
is
Albedo
and
crop
canopy
resistance
and
soil
evaporation.
So,
that
distinguishes
the typical field crop from a reference crop.
So,
means
crop
characteristics
are
incorporated
in
the
determination
of
K
c
or
it
is
incorporated
in
these
four
parameters.
So,
different
crops
have
different
K
c
values,
and
changing
the
characteristics
of
the
crop
over
the
growing
season
also
affects
the
K
c
value.
And
evaporation
is
integrated
part
of
your
evapotranspiration,
conditions
affecting
soil
operation
means
condition
here
that
whether
what
is
the
moisture
content
of
the
soil.
Whether
it
is
ploughed
soil,
whether
it
is the old soil, whether it is already leveled. So, this influences the K
c
value.
Now ,
the
factors
which
influence
the
crop
coefficient,
here
we
can
see
K
c
at
the
mid-season
stage
and
the
crop
you
can
see
here
some
crops
like
pineapple,
peaches,
cotton.
And
some
grass
reference,
mean
this
is
your
reference
crop
as
your
grass.
So,
crops
that
are
falling
mean
you
can
see
pineapple,
peaches,
cherry ,
apple
here
crop
coefficient
at
the
mid-season
stage
is
less
than
the
grass reference crop.
And
crops
which
are
you
know
greater
than
one
means
K
c
value
at
the
mid-season
stage
is
greater
than
one
it
is
cotton,
some
of
the
vegetable
crops
and
then
large
vegetable
crops
and
sugarcane.
So,
crop
type
influences
the
crop
coefficient
value.
Why
it
is
so?
Due
to
differences
in
the
albedo
means
reflectance
characteristics
of
the
crop.
It
influences
the
crop
coefficient
value,
crop height, aerodynamic property means the leaf.
And
then
the
canopy
structure,
the
shape
of
the
leaf.
These
also
influence
the
value
of
the
crop
coefficient.
Stomata
property ,
the
evapotranspiration
from
fully
grown
area
well-watered
crop
differs
from
ET
0
.
So,
the
crop
type
is
one
part
then
spacing
between
the
plants.
How
close
theyare?
How
spaced
they
are?
And
then
the
taller
canopy
height
and
roughness
of
many
fully
grown
agriculture
crops,
this
crops
to
have
K
c
factor
larger
than
one.
This
is
what
we
see
in
these
crops
which have got more K
C
value, greater than 1.
Climate
does
influence
so,
it
is
the
wind
so,
aerodynamic
property
between
the
grass
reference
surface
and
agriculture
crop
is
not
only
crop-specific,
but
this
also
affects.
It
also
varies
with
the
climatic
condition
and
crop
height
because
aerodynamic
properties
are
greater
for
many
agricultural
crops
compared
to
grass
reference.
As
we
are
giving
here
ET
c
means
K
c
is
you
know
the ratio of ET
c
to ET
0
.
So,
for
many
crops,
the
value
of
K
c
is
increasing
as
the
wind
speed
increases
and
decreases
with
relative
humidity .
So,
the
K
c
value
means
for
more
arid
regions
and
conditions
having
greater
wind
speed
have
got
higher
K
c
value.
More
humid
climates
and
conditions
of
lower
wind
speed
have got a lower K
c
value.
So,
this
influence,
now
we
can
see
from
this
particular
figure.
In
this
figure,
we
can
see
here
the
K
c
values
are
ranged
from
point
A
to
here,
it
is
given
range
is
given
point
A
to
1.5.
So,
for
short
crops,
if
we
see
short
crops
like
cabbage,
onion
the
K
c
value
range
is
when
the
case
for
very
humid
conditions
when
we
are
putting
the
K
c
value
is
less
than
1.1.
In
some
cases,
you
know
it
goes up to maximum means less than 1.2 rather we can say .
And
when
we
go
for
the
crops
which
are
the
character
comes
in
the
taller
crop
range
say
cotton,
maize
or
sugar
cane.
And
particularly
for
extremely
arid
and
wind
conditions.
Then
what
we
find
is
the
K
c
value
goes
high.
So,
in
the
statement
which
I
gave
for
a
low
wind
speed
and
a
very
humid
condition,
the
value
of
K
c
is
lower
as
compared
to
the
taller
crops
and
arid
and
windy
conditions.
That
is
what
one
can
see
from
this
particular
graph.
So,
the
means
K
c
is
influenced
by
climate
and weather conditions and also the type of crop characteristic short crop or lar ge crop.Soil
evaporation.
Now ,
this
also
influences
the
crop
coefficient
value.
So,
the
difference
in
soil
evaporation
and
crop
transpiration
between
field
crops
and
reference
surfaces
are
integrated
within
the
crop
coefficient.
Let
us
see
here
it
is
plotted
you
know
K
c
values
on
the
ordinate
and
then
plant
you
know
the
plant
growth
characteristic
it
is
plotted
on
the
x-axis.
Now ,
what
do
we
see here? This is in the early stage means it is in the seedling stage and as the plant grows.
So,
means
initially
what
we
see
there
are
two
leaves
and
four
leaves
and
then
as
the
plant
grows,
means
it
starts
covering
the
ground
cover .
It
means
canopy
growth
development
is
causing
the
covering
of
the
ground.
So,
at
the
initial
stage,
let
us
say
this
soil
is
in
a
typical
dry
soil
characteristic
it
is
shown
here.
So,
soil
evaporation
is
dominant
in
the
initial
growth
stage
of
the
crop or seedling stage.
And
when
it
goes
toward
the
growth
of
the
crop
it
starts
covering
the
ground
cover .
So,
what
we
see,
transpiration
of
the
crop
is
more
you
know
dominant.
Which
we
call
a
basal
crop
coefficient
where
transpiration
is
dominant.
So,
the
value
of
the
soil
evaporation
coefficient
at
the
beginning
stage
is
more.
Now ,
this
is
one
case
when
dry
soil
exists
that
means
a
dry
conditional
soil
surface
exists
and
this
is
the
wet
surface
when
we
are
given
enough
moisture
is
being
maintained
our
irrigation is being given.
So,
a
horizontal
line
here
represents
the
K
c
value
when
the
soil
surface
is
kept
continuously
wet
or
irrigation
is
being
maintained
all
throughout.
A
curved
dotted
line
which
we
see.
So,
the
curved
line
corresponds
to
the
K
c
when
the
surface
is
kept
dry,
but
the
crop
received
sufficient
water
to
sustain
transpiration
means
that
much
amount
of
moisture
is
maintained
where
the
crop
can be able to maintain the transpiration but the value of crop coef ficient we can see here.
It
is
closer
to
2.1
and
when
it
is
in
wet
condition
when
we
are
maintaining
this
then
the
crop
coefficient
value
is
more
than
one.
So,
here
for
wet
soil
conditions,
the
K
c
value
may
exceed
oneand
for
dry
soil
conditions,
K
c
is
small
as
low
as
0.1.
So,
the
soil
surface,
what
is
the
condition
of
the moisture content in the soil? This also causes the Kc, influence on the K
c
value.
Now ,
let
us
see
another
aspect
of
the
crop
coefficient.
So,
let
us
see
this
part.
Just
now,
I
told
you
that
when
the
crop
is
let
us
say
the
crop
has
at
the
initial
stage.
Few
weeks
say
when
the
crop
just
has
emer ged,
leaves
have
emer ged.
So,
this
week,
this
stage
is
called
an
initial
stage.
Now
the
crop
starts
producing
leaves
and
it
goes
to
the
development
stage.
So,
for
few
weeks
let
us
say
that it is in the crop development stage means the ground is started covering with the plant.
So,
as
the
number
of
leaves,
it
increases
say
vegetable
crop
or
any
other
crop,
it
is
not
covering
the
ground.
So,
what
we
are
seeing
for
few
days?
It
is
covering
25%
of
the
ground
and
40%
of
the
ground
cover
and
then
60%.
So,
it
goes
to
a
particular
it
has
reached
to
a
stage
when
the
development
it
has
taken
place
fully.
And
then
it
comes
to
the
mid-season
stage,
we
call
it
a
maturity stage, crop it has got full maturity stage that is a mid-season stage.
And
then
it
comes
to
the
end-stage.
So,
total
crop
growth
stages
can
be
divided
into
four
stages.
The
initial
stage,
crop
development
stage,
mid-season
stage,
and
late-season
stage.
Now
when
the
crop
head
covered
the
fully
ground
and
then
it
is
in
the
full,
you
know
fully
grown
plant
and
it
is
starts
emer ging
flowers
and
then
it
is
started
giving
fruits.
Now
here
is
another
part
it
is
being shown the same crop when we are giving or maintaining some certain irrigation interval.
So,
if
you
are
giving
a
very
short
interval
of
frequent
irrigation,
this
is
your
wet
condition
being
maintained
and
this
is
slightly
you
know
the
dry
condition
means
partial
moisture
conditions
or
we
can
see
soil
moisture
deficient
is
being
maintained.
So,
it
influenced
the
crop
coefficient
value.
So,
this
crop
when
we
see
this
is
the
nature
of
the
graph
when
we
are
maintaining
certain
the soil moisture deficiency .
And
whereas,
here
what
we
see
when
we
are
giving
frequent
irrigation.
So,
particularly
we
can
say
in
the
case
of
micro
irrigation
system,
we
are
not
maintaining
deficit
condition.
We
areexactly
maintaining
an
ideal
condition
where
the
crop
does
not
have
to
go
for
any
moisture
stress.
So,
this
is
more
relevant
for
micro-irrigation
conditions.
Now ,
the
K
c
value
when
the
deficit
is
being
maintained
at
initially
state
we
find
that
it
is
more
or
less
you
know
it
is
maintaining little slightly more than 0.2.
And
when
for
the
same
initial
stage
we
are
getting
almost
equal
to
1
or
more
than
1
in
the
initial
means
in
the
initial
stage
soil
evaporation
component
is
predominant.
And
when
it
comes
to
the
crop
development
stage
the
nature
of
the
graph
you
can
see
here,
there
is
a
considerable
change
in the value for crop type, humidity , or when this is being maintained.
There
are
a
variety
of
crops
which
are
being
shown.
So,
lower
the
value
of
K
c
value
for
short
height
crops
say
cabbage,
onion,
or
apples
as
compared
to
the
sugarcane,
cotton,
or
maize
crop.
Now
for
the
crop,
in
the
harvesting
stage
or
it
is
in
a
drying
stage,
the
K
c
value
is
reduced
drastically .
So,
these
four
stages,
crop
growth
stages
are
influencing
the
K
c
value
and
this
K
c
value is influenced by the soil moisture condition and then the type of crop.
So,
as
it
is
explained
here
as
the
crop
develops
ground
cover ,
crop
height,
and
leaf
area
changes
means
leaf
area
index
changes.
Due
to
differences
in
evapotranspiration
during
various
growth
stages,
K
c
for
a
given
crop
will
vary
over
the
growing
period.
And
at
the
mid-season
stage
that
is
the
stage,
K
c
reaches
the
maximum
value.
So,
maximum
value
when
there
is
you
know
infrequent
irrigation
is
being
given
when
frequent
irrigation
is
being
given
that
value
is
there
but
it reaches a peak value of the K
c
.
And
Kc
value
at
the
end
is
the
late-season
stage
that
reflects
the
crop
and
water
management
practices.
How
the
water
management?
How
the
irrigation
is
being
given?
Whether
irrigation
is
being
given
by
micro-irrigation,
it
is
being
given
by
surface
irrigation
or
it
is
given
by
sprinkler
irrigation.Now ,
here
we
will
be
discussing
about
single
crop
coefficient
approach
where
only
K
c
value
is
used
whether
K
c
is
combined.
So,
let
us
know
that
what
single
crop
coefficient?
It
means
and
that
is
in
the
majority
of
literature,
you
may
find
that
the
single
crop
coefficient
approach
has
been
used.
Now ,
in
the
single
crop
coefficient
approach
the
effect
of
crop
transpiration
and
soil
evaporation,
these
two
components
are
combined
means
it
involves
the
K
e
and
the
crop
transpiration that is K
cb
.
So,
both
are
equally
combined
in
a
single
crop
coefficient.
The
coefficient
integrates
the
difference
in
soil
evaporation
and
crop
transpiration
rate
between
crop
and
grass
reference
surfaces.
So,
as
the
single
crop
coefficient
average
in
soil
evaporation
and
transpiration.
The
approach
is
used
to
compute
ET
c
,
it
is
for
a
weekly
or
longer
period.
Although
calculation
may
proceed on the daily time step.
So,
here
we
are
computing
the
evapotranspiration
or
by
taking
the
number
of
days.
So,
particularly
for
surface
irrigation
system
or
to
a
certain
extent
on
weekly
basis
for
sprinkler
irrigation system, a single crop coef ficient approach is been used.
In
the
dual
crop
coefficient
approach
effects
of
the
crop
transpiration,
soil
evaporation
is
determined
separately .
Two
coefficients
are
used,
one
is
the
basal
crop
coefficient
that
is
K
cb
to
describe
plant
transpiration
and
the
soil
water
evaporation
coefficient
which
we
call
K
e
.
So,
here
these
two
components
are
considered
and
these
two
components
are
important.
We
have
seen
that
at
initially
Stage
K
e
predominant
at
the
growing
stage
as
well
as
the
late-season
stage
or
mid-season stage, K
cb
is you know predominant.
So,
the
basal
crop
coefficient
is
defined
at
the
ET
c
to
ET
0,
where
the
soil
surface
layer
is
dry
but
where
the
average
soil
water
content
of
the
root
zone
is
adequate
to
sustain
full-plant
transpiration.
The
soil
evaporation
coefficient
K
e
describes
the
evaporation
component
from
the
soil surface.Now ,
it
is
the
left
side
diagram
when
we
see
this
is
the
generalized
crop
coefficient.
So,
the
left
side
diagram
is
for
a
single
crop
coefficient
means
K
c
initial,
this
is
a
typical
graph
generalized
by
you
know
crop
coefficient
graph
which
we
are
seeing
here.
So,
K
c
initial
then
K
c
development, K
c
mid-season, and then K
c
late season
means all four stages look like this.
Whereas,
in
a
dual
crop
coefficient
K
e
and
K
cb
these
two
components
are
shown.
So,
K
e
is
predominant
means
the
evaporation
component
is
predominant
at
the
initial
growth
stage.
And
then
it
is
started
you
know
the
evaporation
is
started
slowly
reducing
as
the
crop
development
takes
place.
It
narrows
down
to
a
minimum
value
that
is
the
K
e
component
becomes
the
lesser
as
compared to the K
cb
and then K
e
means.
So,
in
the
mid-season
and
late-season
stage
K
e
is
the
lesser
as
compared
to
the
initial
season,
the
initial
crop
growth
stage.
So,
this
is
important
when
the
crop
is
in
the
different
growth
stages
and
one needs to calculate while using.
So,
general
selection
criteria
for
the
crop
coefficient
approach
it
is
used
when
we
are
taking
a
single
crop
coefficient.
It
is
used
for
irrigation
planning
and
design,
it
is
used
for
irrigation
management,
it
is
used
for
you
know
non-frequent
water
applications
by
giving
irrigation
through
surface
irrigation
means
border
irrigation,
furrow
irrigation
or
sprinkler
irrigation
where
10 day or monthly data and daily data are summed and then one can irrigation is being given.
Whereas
dual
crop
coefficient
uses
the
real-time
irrigation
scheduling
data,
it
is
used
for
frequent
application
of
water
like
micro-irrigation,
automated
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
and
detailed
soil
and
hydrologic
water
balance.
If
someone
wants
to
use
the
data,
in
your
daily
water
balance.
So,
the dual crop coef ficient is more relevant for daily calculation.
Now ,
let
us
come
to
crop
water
requirements.
Crop
water
requirement,
it
is
the
total
quantity
of
water
required
by
a
crop
irrespective
of
its
source
in
a
given
time
for
its
full
normal
growth,
development
under
field
condition
at
a
given
place.
So,
it
includes
the
amount
of
water
to
maturean
adequately
irrigated
crop
to
meet
the
losses
due
to
evapotranspiration
plus
losses
during
application
of
irrigation
water
means,
if
it
is
surface
irrigation,
there
will
be
losses
that
is
the
if
it
is border irrigation, if it is a check basin irrigation there will be unavoidable losses.
An
additional
quantity
of
water
is
required
for
special
operations
such
as
land
preparation,
transplanting
purposes
if
the
soil
has
salt
so
we
need
to
apply
water
for
the
leaching
of
salts.
So,
below
the
crop
root
zone,
there
could
be
some
situation
where
of
the
frost
control
so,
this
is
especially .
So,
total
water
required
that
is
aided
to
get
the
irrigation
water
requirement.
And
now,
typical
water
requirement
values
for
the
variety
of
crops
though
it
is
given
1200
millimeter
for
rice.
But
it
is
used
more
than
1800
in
some
cases,
but
it
depends
on
in
which
season
the
rice
is
being
grown.
So,
the
value
of
crop
water
requirement
from
rice
to
you
know
your
field
crops,
field
cereal crops, vegetable crops, horticultural crops as well as vegetable crops.
So,
fruit
crops
vegetable
crop
all
these
crops
which
are
available
and
these
values
can
be
used
as
your
reference
value
of
course.
These
values
will
vary
depending
on
this
soil,
depending
on
the
particular
variety
of
the
crop,
depending
on
the
climatic
condition,
where
it
is
being
grown
but
this can be used as a reference value or design of irrigation system.
Net
irrigation
requirement
as
the
name
say
that
it
is
the
total
amount
of
water
required
to
bring
the
soil
moisture
content
in
the
root
zone
depth
to
field
capacity .
So,
determining
the
moisture
content,
the
difference
at
the
field
capacity ,
and
moisture
content
before
irrigation.
This
difference
at
the
different
layers
when
we
multiply
with
the
bulk
density
of
soil,
multiplying
with
the depth of root zone then one can get what is the net irrigation requirement.
ùëÅùêºùëÖ= ùëñ=1ùëõ‚àëùëÄùëìùëê ùëñ‚àíùëÄùëè ùëñ100.œÅùëè ùëñ.ùê∑ùëñ
Where,
NIR = net amount of water to be applied during irrigation, cmM
fci
= gravimetric moisture content at field capacity in the i
th
layer of the soil, (%)
M
bi
= gravimetric moisture content before irrigation
in the i
th
layer of the soil, (%)
= bulk density of the soil in the i
th
layer ,
g/cm
3œÅùëè ùëñ
Di = depth of the i
th
soil layer , cm, within the
root zone, cm
n = number of soil layers in the root zone D
Now ,
the
total
soil
profile,
soil
layer
it
can
be
given
made
several
you
know
sampling
it
can
be
made.
So,
4
layers,
3
layers,
5
layers
that
depends
so
i
refers
to
the
number
of
soil
layers,
and
then these values can be used to find out the net irrigation requirement.
And
then
to
get
the
Gross
irrigation
requirement.
So,
net
irrigation
requirement
after
we
have
completed,
we
need
to
divide
this
value
with
the
overall
irrigation
efficiency .
This
will
give
the
gross
irrigation
requirement.
Now ,
with
reference
to
surface
irrigation
as
well
as
when
we
want
to
supply
water
in
the
command
area
by
using
the
canal
irrigation
water ,
there
are
some
certain
terminologies which are used which are important from an irrigation point of view .
So,
duty
is
one
of
the
term
which
is
commonly
used
and
duty
is
defined
as
what
is
the
amount
of
means
the
rate
of
flow
per
unit
area.
It
can
be
given
so,
the
area
that
can
be
irrigated
by
the
continuous
supply
of
irrigation
water .
So,
a
rate
of
1
cubic
meter
per
second
of
water
throughout
the base period this value is used and it is expressed in a hectare per cubic meter per second.
The
base
period
is
another
term
that
is
used.
This
is
the
period
over
which
irrigation
water
is
to
be
supplied
for
the
production
of
any
crop.
Normally ,
this
is
equal
to
the
period
between
the
first
and
last
irrigation
applied
to
a
crop.
Delta
is
another
term.
This
defines
the
depth
of
the
water
during
crop
season
to
be
given
to
meet
the
crop
water
requirement
and
this
does
not
have
any
relevance to the area of the crop field.It
is
expressed
in
millimeters
or
centimeters.
There
is
a
relationship
between
duty,
delta,
and
base
period.
So,
delta
means
your
depth
of
water
can
be
related
as
equal
to
864
multiplied
by
B
by
D.
So,
delta
when
we
express
in
a
centimeter
base
period
when
we
express
in
days
and
D
when
we
express in a hectare per cubic meter , then this is given by delta equal to 864 into B by D.
So,
now
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
have
let
us
summarize
this
particular
we
have
covered
the
concept
of
single
and
dual
crop
coefficient.
We
have
discussed
about
crop
water
requirement
and
irrigation
requirement
terminologies
and
we
will
be
discussing
about
the
different
types
of
Agro-Metrological
instruments
used
to
determine
evapotranspiration.
So,
we
will
demonstrate
some of those equipment in the coming class.
And
so,
that
you
can
have
the
full
knowledge
of
how
this
equipment
can
be
used
for
estimating
the
evapotranspiration
as
well
as
the
other
field
water
balanced
wet
measurement.
It
is
done
for
determining the measurement of evapotranspiration.
So,
these
are
the
references
which
you
can
refer
to
your
study .
So,
thank
you
very
much
and
good day .
