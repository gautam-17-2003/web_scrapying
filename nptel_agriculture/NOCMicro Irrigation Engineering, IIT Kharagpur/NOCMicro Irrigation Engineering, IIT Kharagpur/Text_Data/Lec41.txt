Sprinkler  Irrigation System Design
Hello
participants.
Now
I
will
discuss
on
lecture
41.
This
lecture
41
is
on
sprinkler
irrigation
system
design.
In
the
previous
lecture,
we
discussed
on
the
importance
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
We
discussed
about
different
types
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
and
then
what
are
the
different
parameters
which
are
considered
in
the
sprinkler irrigation system.
When
we
want
to
install
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
we
need
to
have
full
knowledge
about
the
area
and
the
resources
which
are
available
there,
so
that
the
system
is
designed
and
installed
in
the
field
and
we
can
get
the
best
performance
out
of
this.
So
this lecture 41, is on sprinkler irrigation system design.
We
will
be
talking
about
sprinkler
system
hydraulics.
We
will
discuss
about
what
are
the
different
parameters
which
are
required
for
the
design
of
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
The
basic
aim
of
the
design
of
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
is
to
apply
a
uniform
depth
of
water
to
the
whole
field.
In
the
surface
irrigation
method
even
if
we
are
trying
our
best,
but
when
water
flows
over
the
land
surface,
the
water
which
is
at
the
upstream
end
of
the
field
receives
water
for
a
longer
period.
So
it
gets
more
time
for
infiltration by the time waterfront it advances to the downstream end.
So
we
talk
of
the
uniform
depth
of
irrigation
water
to
apply
in
surface
irrigation
system
it
is
just
impossible.
Here
in
the
case
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
it
is
possible
to
apply
the
uniform
depth
of
water
all
throughout
the
field.
This
is
the
main
aim.
We
wish
to
apply
the
desired
rate
of
application
of
water .
Means
precipitation
intensity should be as per the desired application rate.Means
it
should
not
be
more
than
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil.
It
should
be
exactly
matching
with
the
infiltration
rate
of
the
soil.
The
second
part,
the
breakup
of
the
sprinkler
jet,
which
converts
to
the
droplet
size.
That
causes
the
deterioration
of
soil
structure
and
that
seals
the
surface.
So
sealing
of
the
surface
is
not
desired.
It
makes compactness, it does not require.
So
it
is
possible
to
bring
down
the
water
droplets
in
the
desired
size
if
we
choose
adequate
pressure
if
we
choose
the
appropriate
size
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle.
The
efficiency
desired
to
reduce
energy
requirements
in
the
operating
system
and
to
maximize the area of coverage.
This
is
another
point.
If
the
system
is
designed
properly ,
we
have
to
choose
or
we
will
get
horsepower
of
the
pump
which
will
require
lesser
energy,
lesser
power
requirement,
and
lesser
fuel
consumption.
So
this
way
the
energy
requirement
is
reduced and also we will achieve higher system ef ficiency .
Now
the
different
steps
involved
in
the
design
of
sprinkler
system.
So
the
number
one
is
stated
here
an
inventory
of
resources.
Now
inventory
of
resources
means,
how
much
is
the
land
where
we
need
to
give
irrigation.
How
much
is
water
available.
So
whether
it
is
of
adequate
quantity .
What
is
the
source
of
water?
Is
it
groundwater ,
is
it
surface
water ,
it
is
pond
water ,
it
is
a
flowing
river,
stream
water ,
and
then
the
type
of
power source available.
Whether
we
are
using
electrical
energy,
whether
we
are
using
the
diesel
operated
pump,
or
we
are
using
alternative
sources
of
energy.
Maybe
it
is
solar
panel,
solar
system
we
are
using
or
we
are
using
the
wind
energy.
So
this
is
falling
very
much
under
the
inventory
of
resources.
The
land
which
we
want
to
cultivate
and
bring
under
irrigation then how is the topography of that land.
So
the
area
is
to
be
surveyed.
The
topography
elevation
in
the
field
at
all
the
points
where
the
irrigation
is
to
be
given
we
need
to
supply
water
whether
it
is
at
the
highestpoint
and
that
particular
point
is
to
be
considered
while
we
are
designing
the
system.
So
that
the
water
it
reaches
at
the
highest
point
and
this
point
when
we
are
considering
that
elevation
will
be
considered
while
we
are
laying
the
lateral
system.
So
this
will
help
in
the
designing
of
the
system.
So
topography
map
of
the
area
is
one
of
the
important components.
Soil.
The
soil
here
what
type
of
soil
it
is?
Is
it
a
fine-textured
soil
means
clayey
soil,
more
of
the
clay
content?
Is
it
coarse-textured
soil
like
sandy
soil?
So
infiltration
rate
of
these
soils
are
considered
while
we
are
allowing
the
water
to
fall
over
the
ground
surface.
So
soil
texture,
soil
structure,
and
then
the
nutrient
aspect
of
the
soil
is
also
equally
important.
Whether
we
need
to
apply
some
certain
chemicals
along
with
the
irrigation
water ,
so
this
part
also
we
need
to
consider .
Then
source
of
water
as
I
told
you
that
what
is
the
source,
surface
water ,
and
groundwater .
Quantity ,
whether
the
how
much
amount of water it is available.
Accordingly ,
we
will
plan
to
apply
for
irrigation
purpose.
And
then
the
quality
of
water .
Quality
is
equally
important,
whether
it
needs
treatment
before
it
is
brought
for
irrigation.
So
quality
or
it
is
sediment-laden
water .
So
before
it
is
introduced
to
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
we
need
to
apply
a
gravity
system
or
we
need
to
apply
an
adequate filtration system before it is brought for irrigation.
So
there
are
different
ways
to
analyze
the
water
quality
which
already
I
have
discussed
in
the
water
quality
part.
So
we
will
discuss
about
this
part.
Then
the
quantity
of
water
to
be
applied.
What
is
the
quantity
of
water
available
in
the
first
point
I
discussed.
Second
point,
how
much
is
the
demand.
So
demand
will
be
worked
out after knowing the evapotranspiration requirement of the crop.
Now ,
the
ET
of
the
crop
will
depend
upon
which
season
the
crop
is
being
grown.
Is
it
a
summer
month,
is
it
winter
month,
and
is
it
the
rainy
season.
So
this
is
going
toaffect
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop
and
also
depending
on
the
type
of soil and then the sensitivity of the crop, the irrigation schedule will be prepared.
Now
water
which
is
coming
out
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle.
Since
it
is
a
rotating
sprinkler
nozzle,
it
is
forming
a
circle.
So
the
maximum
coverage
is
attained
when
the
jet
coming
out
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle
is
at
an
angle
between
30
and
32
degree
above
the
horizontal. And normally 30 degree is used for rotating at a sprinkler system.
The
empirical
relationship
to
obtain
the
radius
of
the
wetted
area
can
be
estimated
by
using the expression
ùëÖ=1.35ùëë‚Ñé
Where,
R = radius of the wetted area covered by sprinkler (m)
d = diameter of nozzle (mm)
h = pressure head at nozzle (m)
So
this
can
be
obtained
empirically .
While
we
will
conduct
an
experiment
on
the
performance evolution part you will also find out what is the radius of coverage.
A
typical
sprinkler
system
when
it
is
sprinklers
are
laid
are
connected
with
the
lateral.
So
you
can
see
here
this
is
one
lateral.
Now ,
this
lateral
is
connected
to
this
part
let
us
see.
In
here
water
is
taken
from
some
source
with
the
help
of
a
pump.
And
it
is
supplied
by
using
a
mainline
and
on
this
mainline,
the
laterals
are
attached.
One
lateral is here, another lateral is here and then laterals are moved forward.
So
when
a
sprinkler
is
operating
it
performs
a
certain
percentage
of
overlap.
So
this
is
the
typical
water
distribution
pattern
from
a
single
sprinkler .
Now
the
other
sprinkler
which
is
kept
at
a
certain
spacing
let
us
say
it
is
at
50%
of
the
diameter
of
coverage,
the
other
sprinkler
is
kept.
So
the
wetting
is
formed
by
the
secondary
sprinkler .
So
this
is the common area.The
water
which
will
be
received
at
this
part
of
the
circle,
it
will
be
the
water
which
is
distributed
by
this
sprinkler
and
also
water
distributed
by
the
second
sprinkler .
And
this
part
what
you
are
seeing
there
will
be
meant
here
again
what
we
are
seeing
here
at
this
particular
place
the
water
is
being
received
by
three
sprinklers.
Such
type
of
overlap
will
occur .
So
a
single
sprinkler
when
the
water
is
being
distributed
you
see
how
the
wetting
means
soil
moisture
movement
from
a
single
sprinkler
it
will
look
like. So more water is available beneath the sprinkler head.
A dischar ge of the sprinkler nozzle is estimated by
ùëÑ=ùê∂ùê¥2ùëî‚Ñé
Q = nozzle dischar ge (m
3
s
-1
)
A = cross-sectional area of nozzle, (m
2
)
g = acceleration due to gravity (m s
-2
)
h = pressure head at nozzle (m)
C
=
coefficient
of
dischar ge
which
is
of
function
of
friction
and
contraction
losses
(=
0.8 to 0.98)
So
this
way
we
will
calculate,
one
can
get
how
much
is
the
dischar ge
from
a
single
nozzle.
Now
the
dischar ge
from
the
single
nozzle
means
it
will
depend
upon
how
much
is
the
diameter
of
coverage.
The
selection
of
sprinkler
will
depend
on
what
is
diameter
of
coverage,
what
is
the
pressure
available
means
nozzle
pressure
because
this
is
your
h,
it
is
given
and
then
how
much
is
the
dischar ge
coming
out
of
the
sprinkler ,
which
is
a
function
of
h
and
of
course
wind
condition.
This
is
also
that
whether
wind
in
that
particular
place
it
is
a
calm
wind
place
or
it
is
in
the
coastal
zone
where
the
wind
is
a
major
problem.
So
one
has
to
use
these
units
to
get
the
dischar ge
from this and the selection is made by considering these points.
Now
when
we
come
to
the
design
of
laterals,
lateral
receives
water
from
the
main
pipeline
and
also
from
the
sub-main
pipeline.
And
then
on
the
lateral
risers
and
above
the
riser
sprinkler
heads
are
mounted.
So
means
sprinkler
lateral
is
connected
to
the
main
or
if
it
is
a
very
large
area
there
can
be
a
manifold
and
then
on
the
lateral
risers,a
riser
is
a
smaller
pipeline
over
which
the
sprinkler
is
placed
and
then
on
the
riser
pipeline, a sprinkler nozzle is mounted.
Now
design
capacity
of
the
sprinkler
on
a
lateral
is
based
on
the
average
operating
pressure.
This
is
where
we
are
taking
care
that
what
is
the
operating
pressure
which
is
available
on
the
sprinkler .
So
if
we
want
to
find
out
first
of
all
we
will
find
out
what
is
the average operating pressure in the sprinkler system.
So
here
the
lateral
means
we
need
to
take
care
the
frictional
loss
in
the
lateral
pipeline
is
20%
of
the
average
operating
pressure.
So
average
operating
pressure
you
can
see
here,
it
can
be
estimated
by
the
pressure
at
the
farthest
sprinkler .
Now ,
let
us
see
this
is
the
case.
There
is
a
main
pipeline
which
is
perpendicular
to
the
board,
you
can
see
here
and
on
this
main
pipeline,
the
main
pipeline
is
receiving
water
from
the
pump.
And
then
on
the
main
pipeline,
the
lateral
has
been
attached.
In
this
particular
figure
what
we
are
seeing
that
the
lateral
is
kept
at
a
certain
elevation.
Means
it
is
going
up
the
hill.
The
pressure
profile
it
is
lateral
is
laid
up
the
hill
means
it
is
on
the
elevated
land. And on this lateral sprinklers are mounted.
So
sprinkler
this
is
one
sprinkler
and
means
this
is
one
riser
pipeline
and
on
this
riser
pipeline,
the
sprinkler
nozzles
are
mounted.
Now
you
see
this
is
the
last
sprinkler .
And
at
this
last
sprinkler ,
the
pressure
available
is
H
naught.
This
is
the
H
naught
pressure.
And
somewhere
the
average
pressure
means
we
are
measuring
it
somewhere
at
this
point
that
means
not
exactly
at
the
end
of
the
pipeline,
but
we
are
considering
somewhere
at
the
25%
of
the
distance
from
the
extreme
end.
And
this
average
pressure is measured. So this is given by Ha. That is the average pressure.
So H naught equal to 25% of the head loss due to friction.
Now
if
we
are
considering
suppose
this
lateral
we
are,
it
is
placed
here
on
the
elevation
but
if
it
is
this
particular
lateral
is
on
the
level
land.
So
what
will
happen?
The
pressure
available,
the
pressure
available
in
the
main
pipeline
means
what
will
be
the
pressure
available
in
the
main
pipeline,
it
will
be
the
pressure
required
at
the
last
sprinkler
plus
head
loss
due
to
friction.
This
means
the
Ha
means
your
average
pressure at the end, which will be given by
H
n
=  H
o
+ H
f
Now
design
of
the
lateral,
what
we
are
doing
here,
we
are
substituting,
let
me
just
tell
you that we are substituting, we can write here
Where,
H
a
= Average head at the sprinkler lateral (m)
H
0
= pressure at the sprinkler at the sprinkler on
the farthest end (m)
H
n
= Head at the main (m)
H
f
= Friction loss at the sprinkler lateral (m)
H
e
= Maximum dif ference in elevation between first
and last sprinkler on the
lateral (m)
H
r
= Riser height (m)
So
this
particular
expression,
it
is
taking
care
of
the
average
pressure.
It
is
taking
care
of
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
and
then
plus-minus
3
by
4
He
this
is
here
it
is
a
He
that
is
the
elevation.
So
elevation
is
the
head
at
the
elevation
it
is
you
can
see
here
the
maximum
difference
in
the
elevation
between
the
first
and
the
last
sprinkler .
Let
me
just
show
you
the
diagram.
Here
this
is
the
first
sprinkler
on
this
one.
So
what
is
the
elevation? Means suppose sprinkler is somewhere here and this last sprinkler .
So
this
is
the
elevation
difference
that
is
He.
Now
3
by
4
He
because
we
are
taking
at
this
particular
place.
So
we
are
putting
it
3
by
4
plus
minus
3
by
4
He
because
at
this
point
we
are
considering.
So
we
have
taken
here
0.3
this
is
plus-minus
3
by
4
e.
Now ,
plus
means
there
is
what
happened
when
the
sprinkler
lateral
is
running
uphill.
So
this
we
will
consider .
So
here
the
Ha
means
this
is
your
the
value
that
is
average
head
at
the
sprinkler ,
H
naught
is
the
pressure
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
sprinkler
and
Hn
is
the
head
at
the
main.
This
is
your
Hn.
Hf
is
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
in
the
lateral.
He,
as I told you this is the elevation dif ference, and Hr is the height of the riser pipeline.
Means
this
pipeline.
If
we
are
here
it
is
given
Hr
that
is
the
height
of
the
riser.
This
is
the
riser
pipeline.
So
this
has
been
added.
Now
if
suppose
the
riser
if
suppose
we
are
not
putting
riser.
In
the
lateral
itself
these
sprinkler
nozzles
are
attached.
Then
Hr
will
be equal to zero.
So
by
solving
the
equation
means
we
are
putting
it
H
naught
has
been
this
H
naught
is
written
in
terms
of
Ha
and
then
Ha
can
be
written
like
this.
3
by
4
He
is
positive
when
the
lateral
is
running
up
the
hill
and
it
is
negative
when
it
is
down
the
slope.
So
this
would
be
3
by
4
He.
Now
the
size
of
the
main
pipeline
the
size
of
the
main
pipeline
is
a function of the rate of flow and frictional losses.
The
diameter
of
the
main
pipeline
is
selected
such
that
the
normal
means
water
application
cost
is
low.
This
means
the
size
of
the
main
pipeline
is
what
happened
because
the
main
is
supplying
water
to
the
laterals.
So
depending
on
the
number
of
laterals,
it
is
receiving
water
from
the
lateral.
So
one
lateral
so
multiplied
by
the
number of lateral.
So
that
will
be
the
dischar ge
from
a
single
lateral
that
will
be
considered
and
dischar ged
from
the
multiple
laterals.
So
this
particular
lateral
should
take
the
total
flow.
So
here
it
is
another
part
that
is
one
has
to
optimize
that
how
many
number
of
laterals
that
can
be
operated.
If
we
take
all
laterals
to
operate
at
simultaneously
then
the size of the pipeline will be lar ge, size of the pipeline will be lar ge.
And
then
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
will
be
computed
in
the
same
manner
as
we
are
calculating
in
the
case
of
lateral.
So
here
we
will
be
taking
the
same
case.
Now ,
normally
head
loss
in
the
main
is
taken
as
a
3
m.
Means
head
loss
to
friction
is
taken
as
a
3
m
for
a
smaller
system,
particularly
for
Indian
landholding.
So
3
m
is
considered
as
a
head
loss
through
friction
but
one
has
to
calculate.
And
then
12
m
isthe
means
the
head
loss
due
to
friction.
It
is
considered
for
a
very
large
farm
where
the lar ge area it is being used for cultivation of the crop.
The
next
party
height
of
sprinkler
riser
pipeline.
When
we
are
considering
the
height
of
the
sprinkler
riser
pipes,
sprinklers
are
located
just
above
the
crop
to
be
irrigated.
Therefore,
the
height
of
the
riser
will
depend
on
the
height
of
the
crop.
This
means
the
water
which
is
emer ging
out
of
the
sprinkler
nozzle
should
not
be
interfered
by
the
crop.
So
the
height
of
riser
pipes
should
be
above
the
crop
and
then
particularly
some
crops
some
plantation
it
interferes,
then
we
need
to
raise
the
height
of
the
riser
pipe,
such
riser
pipes
should
be
provided
with
a
tripod
so
that
it
remains
stable,
it
does
not
fall
when
water
is
being
supplied
by
the
riser
pipe
to
the
sprinkler
nozzle
because
it
is
vibrating.
So
it
should
be
properly
erected
by
putting
the
tripod.
To
avoid
excessive
turbulence
in
the
riser
pipe
minimum
length
is
normally
30
cm
or
even
1
m
that
is
one
means
of
25
mm
diameter
that
is
used.
So
30
cm
for
the
smaller
crop.
But
for
the
crops
like
sugarcane,
it
would
be
large.
But
normally
the
pipelines,
riser
pipeline,
and
sprinkler
is of 1 m in size.
Sprinkler
spacing,
the
sprinkler ‚Äôs
distribution
uniformity
depends
on
the
operating
pressure,
wind
velocity ,
rotation
of
sprinkler ,
and
spacing
between
the
sprinklers
and
laterals.
So
spacing
is
another
part
that
has
to
be
taken
that
is
how
much
is
the
pressure
and
then
what
is
the
wind
speed.
And
then
the
spacing
between
the
sprinklers
on
the
lateral
means
the
spacing
of
the
sprinklers
along
the
lateral
that
is
also
taken
care.
Adjustment
of
the
sprinkler
and
spacing
should
be
made
or
there
should
be
provision
so
as
to
achieve
maximum
uniformity .
In
general,
the
depth
of
water
near
the
sprinkler
is
more
and
gradually
it
decreases
when
the
sprinkler
jet
goes
out
of
the
circle, which means outer circle.So
while
we
decide
the
sprinkler
spacing,
one
important
point
is
wind
speed.
It
affects
the
water
distribution
pattern.
So
overlapping
is
provided
in
order
to
get
better
uniformity .
So
overlapping
of
the
spray
pattern
of
the
individual
sprinkler
is
required
to
get
the
uniform
depth
of
water
coverage.
So
here
you
can
see
when
there
is
no
wind
so
the
spacing
is
of
65%
of
the
water
spread
area
is
given.
When
the
wind
speed
is
0
to
6
km
per
hour,
60%
of
water
spreads.
6.5
to
13,
50%
and
then
greater
than
13
km
this
is
30%
of
the
water
spread.
This
means
as
the
wind
speed
increases
the
spacing
between
the
sprinklers
decreases.
So
there
is
more
closure.
So
the
arrangement
of
the
sprinkler
is
done
so
as
to
increase
the
water
spread
area
overlap.
But
if
there
is
a
wind
of considerable speed the spacing between sprinklers gets reduced.
Now
sprinkler
dischar ge
considering
the
area
of
coverage.
So
selection
depends
on
the
wetted
diameter
of
the
nozzle,
due
to
the
nozzle
at
a
given
operating
pressure
nozzle
and
then
the
combination
of
sprinkler
spacing
lateral
moves
and
application
rate,
suiting
to
the
soil
and
wind
condition.
The
required
dischar ge
of
an
individual
sprinkler
is
a
function
of
the
water
application
rate
and
two-way
spacing
of
the
sprinkler .
Two-way
here
spacing
of
sprinkler
along
with
the
lateral,
spacing
of
the
sprinkler
along the main. So dischar ge from an individual sprinkler is given by
ùëû=ùëÜ ùëô√óùëÜ ùëö√óùêº
3 6 0 0
Where,
q   = required dischar ge of individual sprinkler (L  s
-1
)
S
l
= spacing of sprinklers along the laterals (m)
S
m
= spacing of laterals along the main (m)
I    = optimum application rate (mm h
-1
)
So
depending
on
the
type
of
unit
which
we
are
using
if
it
is
in
means,
I
application
rate
is
millimeter
per
hour
and
Sl
is
the
spacing
of
sprinklers
along
the
lateral
is
Sl
and
Sm
is
the
mean
spacing
of
the
lateral,
spacing
of
laterals
along
the
main
or
spacing
of
the sprinklers along the main. That way also it can be told.The
same
thing
which
I
told
here
is
that
the
application
rate
it
is
to
be
given
in
such
a
way
that
it
does
not
form
runof f.
And
application
rate
will
depend
upon
the
particular
type
of
soil
texture
and
the
depth
of
soil.
It
will
also
depend
upon
this
land
slope,
prevailing land slope.
So
the
soil
texture
is
coarse,
means
if
it
is
let
us
say
coarse
sandy
soil
and
then
application
rate
it
is
given
5.1
mm
per
hour
and
we
keep
on
reducing
the
size
means
your
texture
means
the
soil
particle
it
is
reducing.
This
means
when
coming
to
the
very
fine
texture
soil
the
application
rate
it
is
decreasing.
So
this
is
the
purpose.
It
is
explained
here
that
when
we
are
selecting
a
particular
type
of
application
rate,
we
need to see that what the application rate is.
Here
is
another
table
it
has
been
provided.
The
slope
is
one
part
and
also
the
type
of
soil
and
then
the
above
land
surface.
Means
values
based
on
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil,
based
on
that
it
has
been
decided.
So
if
you
can
see
here
the
units
are
in
inch per hour . This unit is an inch per hour . And these are the prevailing land slope.
So
if
it
is
a
say
soil
surface
is
not
protected
means
bare
land.
We
can
say
bare
land,
but
if
it
is
light
sandy
soil
for
bare
land,
the
application
rate
is
0.5
to
0.75%
for
the
land
slope
in
the
range
of
0
to
5%.
For
the
same
soil,
you
can
see
when
there
is
a
residue
or
heavy
grass
cover
the
application
rate
can
be
increased
for
the
given
same
slope.
And
then
for
the
same
slope
when
you
see
with
the
different
soil
texture
without
means
so
it
is
medium
textures
soil
with
sandy
loam,
fine
sandy
loam,
and
silt
loam,
this
is
the
range.
And
then
for
a
heavy
texture
that
is
the
clayey
type
of
soil
that
is 0.1 to 0.25. So this way one has to decide the value.
So
the
equation
which
I
was
telling
you
Q
is
equal
to
Sm
into
Sl
multiplied
by
I
divided
by
3600.
So
these
values
have
to
be
chosen.
And
this
is
since
it
is
in
inches
per
hour.
So
this
will
be
multiplied
and
brought
in
the
terms
of
a
millimeter
per
hour
that
value
can
be
used.
The
capacity
of
the
sprinkler
system
means
one
has
to
decide
what
should
be
the
dischar ge
capacity
of
the
pump.
So
this
dischar ge
capacity
of
thepump
will
depend
upon
how
much
area
to
be
irrigated
and
what
should
be
the
depth
of irrigation and then the number of operating hours.
ùëÑ=2780ùê¥√óùëëùêπ√óùêª√óùê∏
So
the
area
in
hectare
means
when
we
are
expressing
Q
in
liter
per
second.
So
crop
area
in
a
hectare,
depth
of
water
application
in
centimeter
and
then
what
is
the
irrigation
interval.
This
means
how
many
days
one
irrigation
cycle
will
be
completed.
And
number
of
hours
the
system
is
operating
and
then
water
application
efficiency .
So
having
got
this
value,
one
can
find
out
the
system
capacity .
Now ,
this
system
capacity
can be matched with the total dischar ge a mainline has to handle.
Now
I
have
given
you
in
the
previous
in
this
particular
slide,
where
I
talked
about
the
head
loss
due
to
friction.
If
you
see
this
particular
slide,
where
head
loss
due
to
friction
has
come.
Now
this
head
loss
due
to
friction
can
be
estimated
just
I
estimated
by
any
one
of
those
three
equations.
And
which
has
been
explained
in
the
design
of
the
drip
irrigation
system.
So
this
is
a
generalized
equation
where
head
loss
due
to
friction can be computed by using this equation
ùêª ùëì=ùêæ√óùëê√óùêø√óùëÑùëö
ùê∑2ùëö+ùëõ√óùêπ
Where,
K
is
a
unit
constant,
c
is
another
constant
that
is
to
be
used
for
a
particular
equation.
L
is
the
length
of
the
lateral
or
pipeline
you
can
say
and
Q
is
the
dischar ge
to
be
handled
by
the
pipeline.
It
could
be
a
lateral
pipeline.
It
can
be
the
main
pipeline.
It
can
be
sub-main
pipeline
and
D
is
the
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
And
this
capital F is the reduction factor . This capital F is the reduction factor .
So
reduction
factor
already
we
have
discussed
and
depending
on
the
type
of
the
unit
which
we
are
putting
it,
one
can
use
a
particular
value
of
the
reduction
factor .
So
one
can
use
the
particular
value
of
constant.
So
let
us
say
that
is
small
c
which
is
there
for
the
Darcy-W eisbach
equation
so
277778.
Then
L
is
the
length
of
the
pipeline
and
M
will
be
in
the
case
of
the
Darcy-W eisbach
equation
if
I
am
using
the
metric
means
SI
unit
then
this
is
m
equal
to
2.
And
n
if
I
am
taking
the
Darcy-W eisbach
equation
this
is
1.
And
the
D
is
the
diameter
in
millimeter .
Accordingly ,
the
value
and
K
is
the
particular unit constant.So
that
K
will
of
course
has
to
be
obtained
by
using
appropriate
expression
say
in
the
case
of
Darcy-W eisbach
equation
we
will
be
using
this
equation.
And
f
is
to
be
obtained
from
the
Moody
diagram.
And
this
is
for
the
Hazen-W illiams
equation.
This
is for the Scobey formula. So accordingly the value of the K will be obtained.
Now
to
find
out
what
will
be
the
head
which
will
be
required
for
the
pump
to
operate?
So this total head against which the pump will operate will be the head required that is
H
t
= H
n
+ H
ft
+ H
j
+ H
s
Where,
H
t
= Total design head against which the pump operates
(m)
H
n
=
Maximum
head
required
at
the
main
to
operate
sprinkler
on
lateral
at
the
require
average
pressure, including riser height (m)
H
j
=
Elevation
difference
between
the
pump
and
the
junction
of
the
lateral
and
the
main (m)
H
s
= Suction head (elevation dif ference between the
pump and source of water) (m)
Now
having
got
the
value
of
the
total
head
requirement,
this
can
be
expressed
the
power
requirement
in
kilowatt
can
be
expressed
by
9.8
into
the
dischar ge
that
is
Q
which
we
require
to
operate
the
main
pipeline.
So
this
is
the
total
dischar ge
in
meter
cube
per
second.
And
this
Ht
just
now
which
I
told
that
is
the
total
head
requirement.
And Ep is the pump ef ficiency .
So
this
is
the
pump
power .
Now ,
this
pump
power
can
be
expressed
in
the
terms
of
horsepower that is
ùëòùëä=9.8 √óùëÑ√óùêª ùë°ùê∏ ùëù
Where,
kW  = input power delivered to pump (kW)
Q   =  dischar ge rate (m
3
s
-1
)
H
t
= total head (m)
E
p
= pump ef ficiency (decimal fraction,
0.6 to 0.7)Then
horsepower
of
the
pump
can
be
given
by
this
your
kW
by
0.746
multiplied
by
the drive ef ficiency .
So
you
may
refer
to
these
reference
materials
for
this
particular
topic.
And
then
let
us
try
to
summarize
the
whole
lecture.
We
discussed
about
different
design
parameters.
We
discussed
about
the
hydraulics
flow
through
the
lateral
pipeline,
hydraulics
flow
through
the
main
pipeline,
and
then
total
the
how
the
water
is
the
water
horsepower ,
pump
horsepower
can
be
estimated.
Now
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
discuss
about evaluation of a sprinkler irrigation system. Thank you very much.
