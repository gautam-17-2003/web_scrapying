Soil Water Constants and Infiltration
Welcome
to
the
4th
lecture
on
soil
water
constants
and
infiltration.
Soil
water
constants
are
the
two
limits
where
irrigation
water
is
a
decided
amount
of
water ,
i.e.
how
much
it
should
be
given.
And
in
this
lecture,
we
will
be
also
dealing
with
the
movement
of
the
water
when
we
supply
from source as you know micro-irrigation drip emitter .
And
we
are
dealing
with
what
is
the
soil
water
content
and
how
the
soil
water
movement
takes
place when it is in saturated condition? When it is an unsaturated condition?
So,
depending
on
the
aspects
of
the
soil
water
content,
the
movement
of
water
takes
place.
Now ,
when
we
say
soil
water
constants
mean
soil
water
constants
are
the
basis
for
irrigation
water
application.
So,
different
terminologies
which
are
referred
to
in
soil
water
constant
one
is
saturation
capacity .
Saturation
capacity
means
all
the
macro
and
micro-pores
are
filled
with
water .
So,
here
as
I
was
referring
there
the
soil
consist
of
pores
and
these
pores
may
have
water ,
may have only air , or partly filled with the air .
So,
if
all
the
pores
are
filled
with
water
means
macro-pore,
macro
means
the
larger
size
pores
and
micro-pores.
If
all
these
are
filled
with
water
we
call
it
a
saturation
capacity .
And
this
is
what
you
are
seeing
here
that
the
soil
is
saturated
and
then
water
is
coming
out
of
the
soil
particles.
The soil is at maximum water retention capacity means all the pores are filled with water .
So,
here
soil
water
retention
is
maximum
and
the
metric
section
is
almost
0.
Another
important
parameter
in
a
soil
water
constant
is
field
capacity .
Field
capacity
means
water
is
held
in
the
soil
after
excess
water
has
been
drained
by
the
force
of
gravity .
So,
gravitational
water
has
beenremoved.
When
this
condition
attains
after
the
gravitational
water
from
the
soil
has
been
drained
out of the soil mass.
So,
it
depends
on
the
type
of
soil,
if
it
is
clay
soil
it
takes
more
than
48
hours
to
72
hours.
If
it
is
a
say
very
coarse
soil,
sandy
soil
it
takes
only
a
few
hours
that
it
could
be
6
hours
itself.
So,
that
type
of
situation
exists
depending
on
the
soil
texture.
So,
field
capacity
of
what
we
are
seeing
here
the
water
is
drained
and
then
part
of
the
pores
are
filled
with
the
air
and
water .
Now
there
is
a
range
for
field
capacity ,
it
is
the
value
is
given
as
0.1
to
0.33
bar,
which
is
soil
moisture
tension,
which means it is negative pressure. So, the negative pressure available is from 0.1 to 0.33 bar .
So,
it
will
depend
upon
the
particular
texture
means
if
it
is
a
fine
texture
soil
you
are
finding
that
it
is
a
0.1
and
it
goes
up
to
0.33
bar.
So,
it
will
depend
upon
the
soil.
So
this
is
an
upper
limit
of
available soil water content from an irrigation point of view .
The
permanent
wilting
point,
plant
roots
are
not
able
to
extract
soil
moisture,
means
soil
moisture
which
is
available
in
the
soil
is
not
adequate
that
can
be
withdrawal
by
the
plant
for
meeting
the
transpiration
requirement.
So,
means
here
what
we
are
seeing
is
there
is
a
moisture
content
available,
but
the
presence
of
air
is
dominating
in
case
of
permanent
wilting
point.
So,
it
is the lower limit of available water .
And
then
soil
moisture
tension
at
a
permanent
wilting
point
is
about
15
bar.
Of
course,
this
is
the
uppermost
limit.
But
you
know
this
varies
with
the
range,
which
means
it
can
be
lower
than
this
15
bar,
it
could
be
7
bar
in
some
soils.
Say
coarse-textured,
very
coarse
textures
soil
where
gravel is present, the permanent wilting point could be in the order of 7 to 10 bars.
And
it
could
be
as
you
know
22
bars
in
the
case
of
clay
soil.
So,
a
general
value
that
is
used
is
15
bars
for
wilting
point.
Available
water
is
the
moisture
content
available
between
field
capacity
and
permanent
wilting
point.
Now ,
this
particular
diagram
explains
the
available
means
when
wesay
that,
this
is
the
total
available
water
from
field
capacity
that
is
theta
FC
to
theta
WP
that
is
your moisture content at wilting point.
So,
this
is
the
total
water
available,
and
readily
available
water
means
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
moisture
content
which
is
a
critical
moisture
content
beyond
which
the
plant
does
not
feel
any
deficiency
in
moisture
content.
So,
a
limit
is
decided
when
we
are
planning
a
strategy
for
giving
irrigation. So, this theta t it is decided in such a way that it does not af fect.
So,
when
we
want
to
partially
give
water
content
means
we
are
making
some
strategy
to
give
deficit
irrigation
in
that
case
we
are
maintaining
moisture
content
at
theta
t.
And
this
ratio
of
the
RAW
and
the
TAW
gives
the
value
of
the
management
allowable
deficit.
So,
the
total
available
water
is
theta
FC
minus
theta
WP
multiplied
by
the
depth
of
the
root
zone.
And
here
it
is
this
particular soil moisture stress coef ficient (K
s
).
ùëáùê¥ùëä=Œ∏ùêπùê∂‚àíŒ∏ùëÉùëäùëÉ
(
)√óùëëùëüùëß
Now ,
this
soil
moisture
is
stress
coefficient
is
maintained
to
give
a
specific
level
of
stress
when
we
have
a
deficit
water
supply .
This
means,
it
is
not
always
to
keep
moisture
content
up
to
theta
FC
that
is
at
field
capacity ,
one
can
have
less
than
that
values
may
be
theta
t
can
be
maintained.
So, there is actually how much level of water stress one can maintain, this is the meaning of Ks.
Now
soil
water
potential
is
the
driving
force
for
water
to
flow
when
soil
plant
atmosphere
is
being
maintained
in
the
soil
water
potential.
Water
flows
from
higher
potential
to
lower
potential
means
higher
moisture
content
to
the
lower
moisture
content.
And
it
indicates
the
amount
of
work needed to be done to displace a unit quantity of water from a given reference point.
So,
if
I
put
it
say
there
is
a
saturated
soil
column,
from
saturated
coil
column
because
of
the
capillary
force
the
water
is
moving
from
that
particular
reference
point
to
a
specific
point.
So,
that
is
the
amount
of
work
that
has
been
done
to
displace
this
particle
by
the
capillary
force.
Nowthe
total
soil
water
potential
(Œ®
t)
can
be
explained
by
this
equation,
which
is
equal
to
the
summation of the matric potential (
Œ®
p(m)).
Œ®
t = 
Œ®
p(m) + 
Œ®
z  +
Œ®
o
It
is
the
summation
of
gravitational
potential
(Œ®
z);
it
is
the
summation
of
osmotic
potential
(Œ®
o).
This
means,
all
3
potential
when
these
are
added
and
this
is
the
metric
potential
because
the
soil
moisture
content
means
the
amount
of
water
that
is
held
by
the
soil
particles.
So,
the
matric
potential,
matric
force
comes
into
the
picture.
Gravitational
potential
in
the
case
of
a
saturated
case when the gravitational water takes place.
This
is
the
case
of
osmotic
potential
when
there
is
concentration
in
the
soil
salt.
So,
I
was
telling
you
in
the
previous
lecture
about
the
osmotic
potential
or
osmosis,
this
is
the
case
when
there
is
a
concentration
of
salt
in
water
or
it
is
in
the
case
of
saline
soil.
Now
this
particular
diagram,
explains
the
soil
water
potential
versus
the
volume
of
soil
water
content.
So,
if
I
look,
these
are
the
three
types
of
soil
when
there
is
a
large
amount
of
sand
is
present
means
sandy
soil.
When
the
clay
silt
and
the
sand
it
is
available,
that
is
your
loamy
soil
and
the
third
one
is
your
clay
soil.
So,
what
we
see
the
soil
water
potential
for
a
given
mean
soil
water
potential
for
a
given
moisture content it is in the case of clay soil is higher as compared to the sandy soil.
It
is
a
simple
case
if
I
put
it
here
say
it
is
a
10
kilo
Pascal
soil
water
potential
or
soil
moisture
tension
if
I
say
soil
water
tension
is
10
kilo
Pascal
or
in
tension
when
we
are
putting
that
in
the
negative
part
that
is
a
minus
10
it
is
written
here.
So,
the
value
of
volumetric
water
content
is
0.1.
For
the
same
you
know
10
kilo
Pascal
case
the
moisture
content
is
high
in
case
of
loamy
soil.
And
in
the
same
soil
water
potential
when
we
are
maintaining
in
case
of
clay
soil
the
value
is
considerably
high.
So,
soil
water
potential
how
it
is
varying
with
a
different
type
of
soil
for
the
given soil moisture content varies with this.So,
this
is
an
important
consideration
one
has
to
see
when
we
are
giving
irrigation
water
supply .
Soil
water
moment,
is
a
complex
phenomenon
and
its
variation,
means
it
states
the
variations,
it
is
moving
in
a
particular
direction
and
then
variation
in
the
force
that
causes
its
movement.
So,
this
is
the
one
particular
case
when
soil
is
saturated
means
all
the
pores
are
filled
with
the
water ,
when
we
are
giving
irrigation
or
we
are
supplying
water ,
it
is
simply
just
gravitational
water
or
the free flow of water takes place.
When
it
is
an
unsaturated
case,
you
are
seeing
the
soil
pores
are
partly
filled
with
the
water
and
partly
filled
with
the
air,
this
is
the
case
of
an
unsaturated
case.
And
so
the
movement
of
water
will
be
less
because
it
is
partly
filled
with
the
air.
And
in
case
of
vapor
means
soil
particles
highly
it
is
dry
soil
and
when
it
comes
with
the
water
vapor .
So,
movement
of
water
does
not
take place, it is simply adhering with the soil particles.
Soil
water
movement
in
a
saturated
condition
is
the
hydraulic
gradient
that
takes
place
from
higher
potential
to
lower
potential.
And
gradients
when
we
say,
so
this
potential
are
divided
by
the
length
of
the
flow
path
will
be
the
gradient
and
then
what
is
the
transmissive
capacity
of
this
soil,
that
is
hydraulic
conductivity .
So,
this
can
be
explained
by
Poiseuille‚Äô s
equation
and
which
explains that the rate of flow (q) is equal to
ùëû=ùëÉœÄùëü4
8ùëô¬µ
So,
q
is
the
volume
of
flow
per
unit
time
or
rate
of
flow
or
dischar ge
we
can
say.
And
P
is
the
pressure
difference
between
two
ends
of
the
tube,
or
simply
you
know
capillary
tube
and
let
it
be
the
soil
particle
where
it
consists
of
the
pores.
So,
it
forms
a
capillary
action,
and
then
the
diameter
of
here
the
important
part
what
is
the
diameter
of
this
capillary
tube
when
the
water
flow takes place from the soil.
So,
you
can
see
how
the
diameter
plays
a
role,
so
it
is
the
4th
power
of
the
diameter
which
is
dominating
the
rate
of
flow.
And
so
it
is
inversely
related
to
the
length
of
flow
or
length
of
the
capillary
tube
and
then
inversely
proportional
to
the
dynamic
viscosity
of
the
fluid
or
water .
So,
this
can
be
given
that
sandy
soil
has
got
a
high
rate
of
flow.
The
area
or
diameter
of
the
soil
poresis
indeed
larger
as
compared
to
the
loamy
soil
or
clay
soil.
So,
pore
size
is
a
dominant
factor
when we apply Poiseuille‚Äô s
equation.
Darcy's
law
is
used
for
the
majority
of
our
case
means
of
the
flow
through
porous
media.
So,
if
we
are
considering
say
a
soil
column
which
is
cylindrical
in
nature
of
having
length
L
and
then
we
are
measuring
2
say
there
are
2
sides,
one
is
the
inlet
end
and
another
one
is
the
outlet
end
that
is
the
downstream
end
and
then
the
area
of
cross-section
of
flow
is
A.
So,
the
difference
in
the head that it is
h
when we are telling that
h
in
and this is your
h
out.
ùëÑùë°=ùëû=‚àíùê¥ùêæùë†ùëéùë°  ‚Ñéùëñùëõ‚àí‚Ñéùëúùë¢ùë°ùêø=‚àíùê¥ùêæùë†ùëéùë°  ‚àÜ‚Ñéùêø
Where,    Q  = volume flow cm
3
q  = volume of flow per unit time cm
3
/sec
t  = time, sec
A  = cross-sectional area, cm
2
K
sat
= saturated hydraulic conductivity ,
cm/sec
change in water potential
between the end of the column, cm                   ‚àÜ‚Ñé = 
So,
h
in
minus
h
out
divided
by
L
will
give
the
hydraulic
gradient.
So,
this
delta
h
by
delta
L
is
directly
proportional
to
the
dischar ge
or
rate
of
flow
.
And
then
it
is
directly
proportional
to
the
area
of
cross-section
of
the
flow.
And
if
I
put
it
that
rate
means
the
flow
through
porous
media
is
directly
proportional
to
the
hydraulic
gradient.
So,
this
is
a
case
at
the
proportionality
constant
which we call a saturated hydraulic conductivity .
So,
the
expression
of
flow
through
porous
media
is
given
by
Darcy's
law.
Darcy
law
is
valid
only
when
the
flow
is
laminar
and
the
Reynolds
number
is
less
than
1.
In
many
cases
the
when
the
flow
is
simply
is
a
flow
means
saturated
flow,
literature
say
that
for
groundwater
flow
the
value
of this Reynolds number is between 1 to 10.Now
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view ,
we
do
not
deal
with
the
saturated
flow.
For
groundwater
flow
through
porous
media,
we
deal
with
the
saturated
flow,
but
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view ,
it
is
unsaturated
flow.
So,
water
potential
that
is
the
matric
potential
is
the
only
dominating
case,
the
gravitational
potential
is
that
not
dominant
in
this
case.
But
we
do
take
into
consideration
while
we
are
means
when
we
are
taking
soil
column
when
it
is
in
a
vertical
soil
column,
so
this
Z
value is considered.
So,
Darcy's
law
is
applied
or
when
we
are
using
the
matric
potential
in
the
case
of
horizontal
flow
we
are
considering.
So,
here
it
is
applied
for
unsaturated
flow
with
some
certain
modifications. So, the rate of flow is your velocity of flow or it can be given by
ùë£=‚àíùêæ‚àÜ(Œ®ùëî+Œ®ùëö)
‚àÜùëô
minus
K
psi,
this
is
your
delta
psi
g
plus
psi
m.
Now
psi
g
is
the
gravitational
potential
and
then
this is a metric potential divided by l that is the gradient it maintains.
Now
when
we
consider
it
unsaturated
case
means
hydraulic
conductivity
is
a
function
of
moisture
content.
Now ,
this
can
be
explained
by
the
rate
of
change
of
soil
moisture
content
when
we
considered
one
direction
dimension
means
the
one-dimensional
case
we
are
considering.
Let
us
say
in
x-direction
when
we
are
putting
it,
so
the
del
by
del
x
K
theta
delta
psi
by
delta
x.
So,
delta psi by delta x means this potential with respect to x.
‚àÇŒ∏‚àÇùë°=‚àÇ‚àÇùë•ùêæ(Œ∏)‚àÇŒ®‚àÇùë•‚é°‚é£‚é§‚é¶
Now ,
this
particular
term
can
be
written
K
theta
we
can
write.
So,
when
we
are
considering
the
Z-direction
that
is
in
the
vertical
direction
when
we
are
considering,
so
the
rate
of
change
of
moisture
content.
This
means
the
change
of
moisture
content
with
respect
to
time
can
be
given
by
del
Z
that
is
in
the
vertical
direction
downward
direction.
This
is
the
diffusivity
term
multiplied
by
del
theta
by
del
Z
plus
del
K
theta
by
del
Z.
K
theta
is
the
hydraulic
conductivity
with
respect
to
moisture
content.
And
D
is
the
diffusivity
term
which
is
also
a
function
of
moisture content.‚àÇŒ∏‚àÇùë°=‚àÇ‚àÇùëßùê∑(Œ∏)‚àÇŒ∏‚àÇùëß‚é°‚é£‚é§‚é¶+‚àÇùêæ(Œ∏)‚àÇùëß
Now
hydraulic
conductivity
is
a
very
important
parameter
which
is
playing
a
role
when
we
are
considering
flow
through
the
unsaturated
or
saturated
column.
So,
it
is
the
ability
of
soil
to
transmit
water
when
subject
to
the
hydraulic
gradient.
So,
K
will
depend
upon
the
particular
type
of
soil
texture
and
also
water
holding.
So,
soil
texture
is
a
function
of
how
the
pore
geometry
exists and accordingly the how much will be the water content is available.
So,
that
is
dominating
and
it
is
a
proportionality
constant.
And
this
particular
diagram,
when
you
look,
that
how
hydraulic
conductivity
is
changing
with
respect
to
the
different
types
of
soil
and
also
soil
water
potential.
So,
hydraulic
conductivity
and
the
soil
water
potential
from
a
negative
sense means negative pressure
point of view I am putting
here.
So,
if
I
put
it
the
soil
water
potential
0.01
to
10
means,
this
is
in
minus
you
know ,
so
minus
0.01
means
the
moisture
content
is
higher
at
0.01
mega
Pascal
as
compared
to
10.
So,
as
the
moisture
content
is
negative
potential
increases,
hydraulic
conductivity
of
the
soil
decreases
exponentially
and
this
can
be
explained
by
this
diagram.
So,
field
capacity
and
wilting
point
how
it
is
varying?
You
can
see
hydraulic
conductivity
at
the
field
capacity
is
greater
as
compared
to
the
hydraulic
conductivity at the permanent wilting point.
So,
the
moisture
content
is
influencing
the
soil
hydraulic
conductivity
and
that
can
be
also
seen
in
the
case
of
these
types
of
two
soils
it
is
given.
One
is
the
2
are
the
2
different
soils
and
how
important
it
is?
The
clay
soil
is
fine-textured
and
you
know
the
soil
water
potential
values
are
relatively
higher
as
compared
to
the
sandy
soil.
So,
hydraulic
conductivity
how
it
is
decreasing
with
the
increase
in
soil
water
potential
is
negative.
So,
the
dimension
of
length
per
unit
time
which is the same for hydraulic conductivity it has a dimension of the same as the velocity .Now
the
values
of
K
that
are
sandy
soil,
sandy
loam
soil,
loamy
sand
soil,
a
loamy
soil
the
value
of
K,
these
are
some
experimental
based
values
that
have
been
obtained.
And
for
many
irrigation
experiments, these values are used while we are deciding to give irrigation.
And
when
we
want
to
find
out
hydraulic
conductivity
in
laboratory
conditions,
we
use
the
constant
head
permeameter
method,
also
we
use
variable
head
permeameter .
So,
this
is
the
diagram
that
you
see
here,
this
is
a
constant
head
permeameter ,
and
on
the
right-hand
side
of
diagram
B,
it
refers
to
the
variable
head
permeameter .
So,
as
you
know ,
when
we
are
bringing
soil core sample putting here undisturbed core sample.
It
is
kept
in
a
chamber
and
then
the
particular
head
constant
head
is
maintained
and
this
head
difference
head
at
the
top
of
the
saturated
soil
column
to
the
center
of
the
outlet
of
this
particular
cylinder .
So,
we
are
maintaining
a
constant
head
and
this
value
delta
h
is
used
to
find
out
the
head
difference.
And
this
is
used
to
find
out
the
hydraulic
conductivity .
So,
a
constant
head
gradient
is
maintained
by
adjusting
the
inflow ,
this
is
what
you
are
seeing
by
adjusting
the
inflow . So, when becomes a constant then only this value is used.
ùêæ=ùëâ.ùêøùê¥.ùë°. ‚àÜ‚Ñé
And
then
we
use
this
expression
that
is
K
equal
to
the
volume
of
flow
divided
by
the
time
this
becomes
the
Q
and
then
that
is
divided
by
area,
so
this
becomes
velocity
unit.
And
then
L
refers
to
the
length
of
the
saturated
soil
core
sample
and
delta
h
is
the
head
difference.
So,
this
value
is
used
to
find
out
the
hydraulic
conductivity .
So,
this
expression
is
applied
to
obtain
the
hydraulic
conductivity .
Now
the
other
one
is
the
falling
head
permeameter .
Now
falling
head
parameter
is
used
for
fine-grained
soil
particles
even
for
the
laboratory
purpose
any
soil
sample
it
can
be
brought,
but
it
should
be
an
undisturbed
soil
sample
and
that
is
brought
here.
So,
the
liquid
that
percolates
through
the
saturated
soil
column,
is
a
saturated
column
and
is
kept
unsteady
means,
here
in
this
case we were maintaining the constant head case we were maintaining.Here
this
particular
head
is
not
maintained
constant;
we
are
maintaining
an
unsteady-state
flow
regime
as
well
as
the
head
is
also
variable.
So,
the
not
necessarily
constant
head
is
maintained
during
the
test
and
we
operate
the
system
in
such
a
way
that
suppose,
there
is
one
head
at
the
particular
time
we
are
keeping
the
h
1
and
then
we
are
maintaining
the
head
h
2
.
And
these
two
heads values are used to find out the hydraulic conductivity (K).
ùêæ=ùêø ùëéùê¥(ùë°2‚àíùë°1) ùëôùëõ ‚Ñé1‚Ñé2‚é°‚é¢‚é£‚é§‚é•‚é¶
And
say
this
is
the
diameter
of
the
soil
column
or
core
and
then
the
tube
diameter
is
A.
So,
the
length
of
the
tube
(L)
and
then
area
of
the
tube
(a)
are
divided
by
the
area
of
the
smaller
tube
divided
by
the
area
of
the
column
2
minus
t
1
means
per
2-time
interval
when
the
values
are
taken
and
then
corresponding
h
1
and
h
2
is
measured.
So,
logarithmic
values
of
h
1
and
h
2
and
then
per
2-time interval when t
1
and t
2
is maintained, the
hydraulic conductivity is determined.
And
these
are
the
parameters
that
V
is
equal
to
the
volume
flow
rate
in
time
t,
a
is
the
cross-sectional
area,
L
is
the
length
of
the
sample,
this
is
the
length
of
the
sample,
and
h
1
and
h
2
are
the
2
heads
at
the
2
different
times
which
is
being
taken
and
t
1
and
t
2
is
the
time
interval.
These are used to find out the variable permeameter value for the hydraulic conductivity .
Infiltration
is
another
process
that
explains
the
entry
of
water
into
the
soil.
And
this
particular
diagram
explained
how
the
infiltration
takes
place
from
the
saturated
media
and
then
the
moisture
content
is
high.
You
are
finding
and
then
when
the
drip
system
when
you
are
operating
a
dripper ,
so
interesting
part
is
the
dripper
explains
the
typical
movement
of
the
water ,
this
kind
of movement of water it takes place.
But
the
water
is
moving
vertically
downward
and
the
rate
at
which
water
interest
is
known
as
infiltration
rate.
And
if
the
experiment
is
continued
for
a
longer
period
so
the
accumulated
depth
of
water
infiltrated
with
time,
total
time
in
a
given
time
is
known
as
an
accumulated
depth
of
infiltration.
When
the
rate
of
infiltration
becomes
constant,
after
a
certain
time
a
steady-state
is
reaches such a distant filtration rate is known as a basic infiltration rate.And
this
infiltration
test
is
used
for
the
design
of
experiments,
design
of
irrigation
experiments.
And
mainly
for
irrigation
purposes,
we
are
using
the
value
of
infiltration,
when
we
are
applying
a
sprinkler
system
when
we
are
applying
the
drip
system
so
that
it
does
not
form
runof f.
The
application rate should match the infiltration rate of the soil.
Now
when
we
conduct
the
experiment
and
find
out
the
infiltration
depth,
so
what
do
you
find
that
with
the
time
when
you
are
putting
it
and
then
the
depth
of
infiltration
you
are
plotting,
cumulative
depth
of
infiltration
you
find
it
this
kind
of
a
graph
it
exerts.
It
develops,
this
is
known
as
a
cumulative
depth
of
infiltration.
Now
when
you
take
the
derivative
of
this
curve,
when
you
are
taking
derivatives
of
that
curve
with
respect
to
time,
this
is
known
as
the
infiltration rate curve.
And
at
this
particular
point
when
we
are
seeing
that
it
has
reached
the
steady-state
or
constant
rate
of
infiltration,
this
is
known
as
a
basic
infiltration
rate.
Now
infiltration
rate
decreases
with
time.
Because
the
topsoil
pores
become
saturated,
moisture
content
has
increased.
So,
that
has
caused a decrease in the rate of infiltration.
Now ,
infiltration
can
be
measured
by
using
a
single-ring
infiltrometer
or
double-ring
infiltrometer .
So,
in
the
case
of
a
single
ring
infiltrometer
you
are
finding
out
the
depth
of
water
in
this
cylinder .
Now ,
it
may
happen
beyond
this
depth
of
cylinder ,
water
may
go
in
the
lateral
direction. So, that is one limitation in the case of a single-ring infiltrometer .
But
when
we
are
using
a
double-ring
infiltrometer
means
the
smaller
cylinder
is
kept
inside
the
outer
cylinder .
So,
there
is
2
concentric
cylinder
and
they
are
of
60
centimeters
in
diameter ,
the
inner
cylinder
is
30
centimeter
in
diameter
and
then
water
is
being
poured
from
the
top
and
then
it
is
allowed
such
that
this
outer
cylinder
depth
of
water
it
maintains
a
buffer
zone,
so
water
enters vertically downward.So,
this
is
the
type
of
flow
which
we
are
observing
here,
that
here
it
is
moving
lateral
direction
whereas
water
level
fall
in
the
inner
cylinder
is
measured
by
using
the
scale
by
using
the
gauge
it
could
be
point
gauge
or
it
could
be
the
hook
gauge.
And
the
cumulative
depth
of
infiltration
with
time is being monitored and then the cumulative depth of infiltration is plotted.
And
then
we
get
this
kind
of
a
graph,
which
means
accumulated
depth
of
infiltration
with
time
when
it
is
plotted
it
gets
this
kind
of
a
graph.
And
this
graph
is
explained
by
Kostiakov‚Äô s
equation which is given by
ùëç=ùëé ùë°ùëè
When in the infiltration rate form when you are making the dif ferential form of the equation
ùêº=(ùëé ùëè) ùë°ùëè‚àí1
Where,
Z = depth of infiltration, cm
t = time or intake opportunity time, min
I = infiltration rate, cm/min, and
a and b= parameters  (a > 0 and 0 <b< 1)
And
we
can
see
that
this
will
be
the
infiltration
rate
equation.
And
if
you
want
to
take
the
logarithmic
part
of
this
equation.
It
becomes
a
linear
equation
and
this
linear
equation
can
be
used to obtain the value of a and b.
log Z = log a + b log t
log I = log (ab) + (b-1) log t
Modified Form:
ùëç=ùëé ùë°ùëè+ùëê.ùë°
ùêº=(ùëéùëè) ùë°ùëè‚àí1+ùëê
c is the steady state infiltration rate
So,
there
are
other
infiltration
equations
that
are
used,
one
is
Horton‚Äô s
equation,
these
equations
are
superior
to
the
Kostiakov‚Äô s
equation.
And
it
is
used
mainly
in
the
hydrologic
study
as
well
asand
the
value
of
K
as
well
as
f
0
,
f
c
these
values
they
are
being
obtained
from
by
conducting
the

Horton infiltration equation:
ùëìùëù=ùëìùëê√ó(ùëìùëú‚àíùëìùëê)√óùëí‚àíùëòùë°
Where,
f
p
= infiltration capacity in mm/hr at any time t
f
o
= initial infiltration capacity in mm/hr
f
c
= final constant infiltration capacity mm/hr at
saturation, dependent on soil type and vegetation
t = time in hour from the beginning of rainfall
k = an exponential decay constant dependent on soil type and vegetation
And then Phillips equation is another equation:
ùêπ(ùë°)=ùëé+(( ùëÜ2)√óùë°‚àí0.5)
Where,
a = Minimum infiltration capacity
S = Initial infiltration capacity
So,
these
are
some
important
equations
which
are
being
used
to
establish
their
constant
and
then
this is being used.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
dear
participants
we
studied
soil
water
constants
and
soil
water
potential,
we
studied
soil
water
movement
in
relation
to
irrigation
water
application,
we
studied
infiltration
models,
we
also
studied
how
to
conduct
infiltration
tests.
We
did
study
how
to
determine
the
hydraulic
conductivity
of
the
soil
in
laboratory
conditions.
So,
there
are
methods
also to find out the hydraulic conductivity by using the field test.
So,
those
are
there,
now
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
work
out
some
problems
that
we
discussed
in
previous
lectures
that
are
on
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
we
studied,
we
alsostudied
soil
water
movement
as
well
as
infiltration.
So,
we
will
work
out
in
the
coming
lecture
we will do exercises and so that you get hands-on experience on these topics.
So,
you
may
refer
to
these
books,
these
are
A.M
Michael
by
irrigation
theory
and
practice
which
can
be
used
as
a
textbook.
And
then
there
are
other
books
which
can
be
used
and
then
these
materials
are
available
in
E-course
developed
by
us
at
IIT-Kharagpur
for
ICAR.
So,
such
material can also be referred from there.
Thank you very much.
