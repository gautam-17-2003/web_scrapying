Standards and Quality Assurance of Sprinkler  Irrigation System Components
Hello
participants,
I
welcome
you
to
micro
irrigation
engineering
course
on
this
particular
topic,
lecture
47
of
standard
and
quality
assurance
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
components.
In
lecture
46,
we
discussed
about
standards
and
quality
assurance
of
micro
irrigation
system
components.
Now
these
standards
are
very
important
to
get
the
good
quality
material
which
can
perform
well
in
the
field
and
mainly
agricultural
equipment,
these
equipment’ s
are
kept
in
the
field
for
longer
period.
It
passes
through
the
atmospheric
conditions,
ambient
condition,
and
harsh
weather .
So,
such
material
should
not
get
deteriorated
by
the
hot
sun
or
solar
radiation
or
it
should
remain
there
as
per
the
expected
life
which
manufacturers
claim.
So, it needs to be get tested.
So,
here
we
are
discussing
about
the
polyethylene
pipe,
which
are
used
for
conveying
water ,
in
the
network
of
irrigation
system
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
There
are
joints,
and
these
are
the
quick
coupling
joints
and
fittings
which
are
used
for
the
joining
the
pipelines
or
making
fittings.
Then
design
an
operational
requirement
for
operating
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
so
these
are
also
important
components
while
we
are
installing
the
systems.
And
test
methods
for
uniform
distribution
of
water
through
sprinkler
nozzle
this
has
been
also
covered
in this particular lecture.
The
BIS,
which
is
Bureau
of
Indian
Standards
for
sprinkler
irrigation
system
components.
So,
these
are
the
specification
which
has
been
meant
for
polyethylene
pipes
which
is,
IS
1415-1
(1999)
which
is
for
irrigation
equipment
is
sprinkler
pipes
part
1.
Then
for
quick
coupled
polyethylene
pipes
because
these
pipes
are
of
sub-standard
length
of
3
meter
6
meter
9
meter
or
12
meter
long
and
so
it
needs
to
be
fitted
quickly
it
should
not
take
time.
So,
and
whether
they
are
leak
proof,
so
this
is
the
standard
which
has
been
given
by
BIS
which
is
1415-1
(2008)
for
irrigation
equipment
sprinkler
pipe
part
2
and
then
for
design
and
operation
requirement
this
is
the
standard
which
is,
IS
1223-1
approved
in
1996.
So,
this
is
for
rotatinghead
sprinkler
nozzles
and
test
methods
for
testing
the
uniformity
of
water
distribution.
This
is
also
it
is
given
at
12223-2.
So,
one
need
somebody
wants
to
go
in
deeper
about
this
part
more
detail
then
these
standards
BIS
standard
one
should
check
these
are
available
in
the
library .
So,
tests
for
polythene
pipe
as
I
given
you
this
is
IS
1415-1
(1999).
So,
test
which
are
required
to
carry
out
one
is
the
Carbon
Black
Test,
which
in
the
short
form
we
called
CBC
test,
and
then
the
Carbon
Black
Dispersion
test,
Ovality
test
whether
pipe
remain
in
the
same,
it
has
not
deformed
when
it
is
subjected
to
load
on
a
particular
temperature
when
it
has
been
given
so
ovality
test
is
carried
out.
Other
test
is
to
find
out
whether
the
units
it
has
got
uniform
wall
thickness,
so,
there
is
a
test
for
this.
And
then
hydraulic
characteristic
curve
reversion
test,
this
is
another
test
which
is
done.
Tensile
strength
test,
for
elongation
and
then
density
test,
melt
flow
rate
test
so
these
are
the
9
test
which
has
been
suggested
for
the
sprinkler irrigation pipes.
So,
when
it
comes
to
the
Black
Carbon
Test,
Black
Carbon
Test
offers
excellent
mechanical
properties
and
resistance
to
oxidation,
weathering
and
it
is
used
to
assess
the
level
of
carbon
content
which
is
important
to
keep
the
control
of
plastic
properties.
So,
permissible
limit
that
how
much
there
should
be
carbon
content.
So,
this
carbon
black
content
in
the
permissible
limit
is
given
as
a
2.5
+
-
0.5%.
Now
as
per
the
suggested,
this
is
the
standard
test
procedure
which
has
been
set
in
the
IS
2530
(1963)
one
should
use
this
test
to
know
the
how
much
is
the carbon black content available.
This
is
the
device
which
is
used
to
find
out
the
carbon
black
content
and
then
it
is
a
calculated
by using the CBC is given by
CBC =(w
1
-w
2
)×100 / w
3
Where
w1
is
the
weight
of
residue
in
gram.
So,
residue
plus
boat
and
then
w2
is
the
weight
of
boat
in
gram
and
then
w3
is
the
weight
of
the
material
in
gram.
So,
this
way
one
can
find
out
how
much
is
the
black
carbon
content
in
this
plastic
pipe.
So,
this
is
the
black
carbon
dispersion
test
is
used,
within
the
plastic
to
get
required
stability
and
large
agglomerates
rates
of carbon black can cause the opposite of the desired result especially in pipe material.So,
using
that
particular
test
procedure,
which
has
been
specified
in
the
manual
that
can
be
used
and
then
this
particular
thing
which
you
are
seeing
in
the
right
side
of
the
diagram
this
shows
that
the
portion
of
the
black
carbon
dispersion
it
is
within
the
field
of
view
of
one
millimetre
under
200
times
magnification.
It
has
been
then,
so
whatever
the
fleek,
white
streaks
which
are
seen
there,
that
is
giving
us
to
find
out
the
number
and
size
of
the
agglomerates
which
means
that
is
in
the
standard
way.
So,
the
means
this
particular
CBD
is
the
material
under
test
shall
be
considered
satisfactory
if
the
specimen
show
a
uniform
background
free
from
white
streaks
and
the
number
and
size
of
the
agglomerates
are
not
greater
than
number
and
size
of
agglomerates
given
in
this
particular
figure.
So,
this
is
a
standard from there actually it is compared.
Ovality
test
as
the
name
is
said
that
quality
means,
it
has
deformed
from
the
original
shape.
So,
ovality
is
a
measurement
to
express
percentage
of
the
variation
between
the
maximum
outside
diameter
that
is
OD
minus
minimum
OD
divided
by
the
nominal
OD
that
is
outside
diameter .
So,
ovality
is
estimated
in
percentage
that
is
maximum
outside
diameter
minus
minimum
outside
diameter
divided
by
the
rated
outside
diameter .
That
is
the
manufacturer
give
that
what
is
the
rated
diameter
it
is
available
that
is
design
diameter .
And
if
there
is
any
deformation in this takes place that deformation should be within the prescribed limit.
So,
this
is
the
device
and
then
the
procedure
is
stated
in
this
IS
code.
So,
the
IS
code
as
well
as
ISO
code
of
3162.
So,
far
the
nominal
diameter
of
63
millimetre
in
size
as
well
as
outside
diameter .
So,
nominal
tolerance
is
allowed
that
is
a
+
-
0.6
millimetre.
And
ovality
is
given
as
1.5
this
is
the
ratio
you
have
seen
that
the
how
the
maximum
diameter
minus
minimum
outside
diameter
divided
by
the
rated
diameter ,
so
ovality
it
is
estimated
here.
So,
this
should
be
within
1.5
and
then
another
one
is
set
for
75
millimetre
diameter;
this
is
the
range
which
is
given.
So,
this
particular
device
is
used
to
find
out
the
roundness
to
the
oval,
oval
means
ovality of the pipe size.
The
Reversion
Test,
it
find
out
the
presence
of
moisture
and
volatility
of
the
material.
So,
here
the
test
procedure
to
find
out
how
much
is
the
moisture
present
and
then
what
is
the
volatility
of
the
material.
It
is
given
in
this
particular
IS
code
4985
and
these
are
the
two
codes
which
has
been
stated
and
then
here
the
specimen
is
placed
at
150
degree
Celsius
on
atray
with
the
smooth
surface
and
this
smooth
surface
is
provided
with
a
talcum
powder
and
then
it
is
found
that
how
much
time
it
should
take,
the
time
taken
in
case
the
pipe
of
wall
thickness
not
greater
than
8.6
millimetre.
Then
60
minute
time
is
given
and
in
case
the
thick
wall,
the
wall
thickness
is
greater
than
8.6,
then
120
minute
time
is
given
and
for
greater
than
14.1
millimetre
240.
So,
these
are
the
values
which
are
prescribed
for
a
different
thickness.
Wall
thickness
of
the
material
to
find
out
the
how
much
moisture
and
the
smoothness
is
available in the pipeline.
Wall
thickness,
this
is
the
schedule
numbers
for
the
pipe
size
or
wall
thickness
is
estimated
to
get
uniform
relationship
between
the
design
pressure
and
allowable
stress.
So,
wall
thickness
is
given
by
1000
multiplied
by
the
ratio
of
the
pressure
that
is
the
design
pressure
divided
by
the
allowable
stress.
So,
this
ratio
multiplied
by
thousand
gives
the
wall
thickness.
And
this
is
all
further
means
the
thickness
is
basically ,
you
can
see
here
this
is
the
in
the
diagram
right
side
diagram
this
is
the
thickness
of
the
pipeline.
So,
thickness
is
also
prescribed
for
the
different
diameter
of
the
pipeline
and
also
for
rated
pressure,
how
much
pressure,
it
is
it
should
withstand.
So,
according
to
the
pressure
and
the
stress
is
developed
the
thickness
is
given.
So,
this
is
for
class
2
pipeline
which
is
of
nominal
diameter
of
63
millimetre
the
wall
thickness
it
is
in
the
range
of
minimum
2
to
2.4
that
is
a
maximum
value
and
in
case
of
class
1 pipe which is of 75 millimetre diameter this is also 2 to 2.4 thickness is recommended.
Internal
pressure
creep
rupture
test,
means,
this
is
for
evaluating
the
effect
of
long-term
stress
on pipe material in order to prevent failure. So, test pressure is given by
Where
p
= test pressure (Mpa)
s
= minimum wall thickness (mm)
σ
i
= induced stress (Mpa)
d
= nominal outside diameter (mm)
So,
this
is
nothing
but
the
internal
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
So,
it
is
estimated
that
your
test
pressure
that
is
your
internal
pressure
creep
rupture
test.
It
is
estimated
that
is
a
test
pressure
p
is
given
here,
when
it
has
been
quality
test
it
is
done.
The
test
temperature
is
80,
for
80
degree
Celsius
the
duration
is
of
165
hours
and
then
induced
stresses
it
should
withstand
3.5.
And
then
the
type
test
this
would
withstand
the
induced
pressure
of
3.8.
So,
sample
should
remain
intact
while
passing
through
the
given
temperature
and
pressure.
So,
for
to
carry
out
this
particular
test,
this
is
the
code
which
has
been
specified
and
that
is
given
for
this
particular
test.
Tensile
test,
the
tensile
test
it
is
an
ability
of
plastic
material
to
withstand
maximum
amount
of
tensile
stress
while
the
pipe
is
or
material
is
pulled
or
stretched
without
failure.
So,
it
is
given
by
maximum
tensile
load
sustained
by
the
test
specimen
divided
by
the
original
cross-sectional
area
of
the
specimen
at
breaking
point.
So,
tensile
strength
at
yield
minimum
it
is
given
19
mega
Pascal
and
elongation
at
break
minimum
it
should
be
500%
and
the
instrument
which
is
used
it
is
UTM
that
is
universal
test
machine.
Test
procedure
code
is
specified
and
that
is
a
2530
and
according
to
ISO
this
code
is
the
6259.
So,
now
these
procedures
can
be
obtained
from
these
codes.
And
then
how
in
this
machine,
the
sample
is
kept.
So,
this
is
a
test
piece
and
the
dimensions
of
the
test
piece,
and
when
we
are
doing
it,
this
is
specified
in
this
particular
table
and
then
how
the
sample
is
equipped
in
the
machine
and
then
the
test
means
for
HDPE
pipeline
this
particular .
So,
there
is
a
research
paper
by
Alfitouri
et
at.
(2018)
they
have
published
research
paper
and
this
paper
is
published
in
the
international
journal
of
applied
engineering
research.
So,
for
detail
to
carry
out
this
particular
test. One can refer this particular paper .
Then
density
of
pipe
material
is
another
test
which
is
carried
out.
So,
density
of
a
pipe
sample
may
change
due
to
change
in
the
crystallinity ,
loss
of
plasticizers,
absorption
of
solvent,
etc.
So,
it
is
important
to
know
that
density
varied
with
the
temperature
mainly
because
these
pipes
are
kept
in
the
field
it
under goes
several
types
of
the
temperature
it
may
go
in
a
very
cold
region
means
the
extreme
cold
region.
So,
very
low
temperature
and
during
hot
summer
temperature
where
the
temperature
goes
more
than
50
degrees
centigrade
in
our
country
itself
such
conditions
exist
should
this
density
test
is
important
from
that
point
of
view .
Normally ,
density
shall
vary
between
the
940.4
kg
per
cubic
meter
to
958.4
kg
per
cubic
meter .
It
shouldnot
differ
from
nominal
value
by
more
than
3
kg
per
cubic
meter .
This
is
the
standard
means
this
is
the
standard
prescribed
by
BIS.
And
this
is
the
code
of
BIS
code
which
has
been
given
that
2530
should
be
referred
for
making
the
density
test.
A
density
test
which
is
the
means
your
density
of
the
polyethylene
pipeline
is
estimated
by
using
this
expression
which
where
it
is given.
ρ
p
=(a
1
x 
ρ
ba
) ×100 / (a
1
-a
2
)
ρ
(corrected)
= ρ
b
- 4.5 × c
Where,
ρ
p
= density of the polyethylene (kg/m
3
)
a
1
= mass of the specimen in air (g)
a
2
= mass of the specimen in butyl acetate (g )
ρ
ba
= density of butyl acetate (kg/m
3
)
c = numerical value of the percentage of carbon black in the material
So, this way one can find out the density of the pipe material.
Another
test
is
melt
flow
rate.
So,
this
test
is
used
to
determine
the
exact
time
extrusion
response
time
or
behaviour
and
the
temperature
at
which
the
polymer
material
will
melt.
And
this
test
procedure
is
specified
in
this
particular
code
that
is,
IS
2530
(1963).
The
melt
flow
rate
should
vary
in
the
means
it
is
in
the
range
of
0.2
to
1.1
gram
means,
this
is
the
limit
it
has
been
given
for
10
minutes
and
fall
within
+
-
30%
of
the
value
declared
by
the
manufacturer .
So,
this
is
the
thing
of
the
test
one
should
follow
for
this
test.
And
this
is
the
device
which
is
used
that
is
a
melt
flow
indexer
where
this
sample
is
kept
it.
So,
melt
flow
index
it
is
the
measure
of
how
many
grams
of
polymer
flow
through
the
die
in
10
minutes.
So,
this
is
the
device
which
is
used
and
this
is
computed
by
using
the
expression
that
is
the
average
weight
of
cut
off
sample
multiplied
by
600
divided
by
t
that
is
the
time
interval
in
second
so
this
give
the MFR value.
So,
we
discussed
about
the
in
case
of
your
plastic
pipes
those
test
means
this
your
density ,
melt
flow
rate,
carbon
black,
carbon
black
dispersant.
We
discussed
about
wall
thickness
we
discussed
about
the
tensile
strength.
So,
all
those
tests
we
did
it
in
case
of
pipe,
so
those
tests
are
also
applicable
for
the
quick
coupled
polyethylene
pipes
and
fittings.
And
this
is
thespecification
for
this,
then
other
tests
which
are
there
in
addition
to
these
5
tests.
There
are
other
tests
which
are
applicable
in
case
of
quick
coupled
polythene
pipes
these
tests
are
holding attachment of coupler parts, leakage test, rubber ring.
So,
holding
attachment
for
the
coupler
it
should
be
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
pressure,
two
times
the
working
pressure
of
the
pipe.
This
is
the
important
thing
means
when
any
pipe
it
is
joined,
so,
it
should
be
this
much
time,
and
this
much
of
pressure
it
should
be
2
times
of
the
working
pressure.
Leakage
is
another
very
important
component.
If
this
leakage
when
water
comes
in
pressure
so,
there
the
pipes
should
not
leak
from
the
joints.
So,
this
is
important.
So
this
should
be
in
a
prescribed
limit
and
during
the
test
pressure
shall
gradually
increase
from
0
value
to
the
maximum
pressure
and
this
pressure
is
given
for
one
hour
duration and then leakage test is conducted.
The
rubber
ring,
this
is
the
ring
which
is
provided
to
prevent
leakage
from
the
pipeline
wherever
we
are
joining
the
quick
coupling
devices.
So,
one
pipeline
means
with
the
male
and
female
these
2
pipelines.
So,
there
is
O
ring
and
this
O
ring
is
made
up
of
a
rubber
high
quality
rubble
material.
So,
this
is
maybe
this
is
made
up
of
a
nitrile
or
neoprene
such
type
of
material
used
and
this
should
have,
it
should
pass
through
a
specific
test
and
this
test
is
carried
out
and
then
one
means
it
is
a
form
that
means
the
black
colour
performance
and
then
portable
shore
hardness
such
things
are
being
carried
out
at
by
giving
the
temperature
of
70
degree
centigrade
and
this
is
kept
for
7
days
and
then
the
deformation
is
taken
that
it
should
be within the 10% of the value.
Then
design
and
operational
requirement
of
the
irrigation
equipment.
Rotating
sprinkler
part
one
is
specified
by
this
particular
code.
And
then
the
test
for
finding
out
the
uniformity
of
water
distribution
it
is
expressed
by
this
particular
code
and
given
here.
So,
let
us
try
to
know
what
are
the
tests
which
are
performed?
So,
test
for
rotating
sprinkler ,
so
it
is
a
test
for
resistance
of
the
nozzle,
test
for
resistance
of
hydrostatic
pressure
at
ambient
temperature,
then
hydrostatic
pressure
for
high
temperature,
uniformity
of
rotational
speed,
then
test
of
distribution,
test
of
range
of
effectiveness
effective
pressure
these
are
the
tests
which
are
used
for rotating head sprinkler .So,
this
is
the
device
which
you
are
seeing
the
top
portion
is
the
rotating
head
sprinkler
and
it
is
mounted
on
the
riser
pipeline.
And
then
all
the
test
which
you
see
here
that
is
carried
out
and
then
what
should
be
the
height
what
should
be
the
nozzle
height
from
this
connection.
And
then
there
is
a
pressure
gauge
which
is
mounted
here
to
find
out
at
what
is
the
operating
pressure the pressure this particular sprinkler nozzle, it is operating.
So,
these
nozzles
the
sprinkler
head
these
are
mounted
it
could
be
of
metal
sprinklers
or
it
can
be
plastic
sprinklers.
So,
metal
sprinkler
threaded
conduction
shall
withstand
the
torque
of
50
newton
meter
for
threads
up
to
25
millimetre
means
for
one
inch
then
we
can
say
up
to
1
inch
thread
the
torque
should
be
this
range
and
for
plastic
sprinkler
a
torque
of
100
newton
meter
for
threads
greater
than
25
millimetres
without
showing
any
sign
of
damage
during
the
test.
So, this is the test for the resistance.
Test
to
hydrostatic
pressure
at
ambient
temperature.
So,
it
is
conducted
to
test
the
recommendation
given
by
or
prescribed
by
the
manufacturer
and
then
this
is
carried
out.
So,
it
is
starting
from
the
one
fourth
of
the
test
pressure
in
the
stages
and
it
goes
200
kilo
Pascal
and
holding
the
system
pressure
for
five
second
at
each
pressure
gauge
for
metal
sprinkler .
This
is
for
the
plastics,
when
metal
sprinklers
when
it
is
done
that
this
maximum
pressure
is
twice
the
maximum
effective
pressure
for
10
minutes,
for
plastic
sprinkler ,
this
is
a
twice
the
P max per one hour at ambient temperature and no defects and leakage appear during the test.
Test
for
resistance
to
hydrostatic
pressure
at
high
temperature
so
this
means
that
was
for
the
ambient
temperature,
normal
temperature
at
place
but
ambient
means
high
temperature
means
particularly
during
places
arid
region
particularly
in
Rajasthan
conditions
the
temperature
goes
very
high.
So,
our
sprinkler
should
withstand
it
should
work
there
so
for
that
particular
pressure
this
should
be
tested.
So,
test
assembly
is
to
a
hydrostatic
a
hydraulic
pressure
source
and
increases
from
0
to
the
maximum
that
is
a
maximum
potential
pressure
within
a
period
of
15
second.
Maintain
P
max
for
a
period
of
one
hour
for
metal
sprinklers
and
for
24
hours
for
plastic
sprinklers.
So,
these
are
and
the
time
duration
which
has
been
given
for
both
types
of
sprinklers
and
then
the
procedures
are
explained,
other
procedures
are
explained
in
these steps.Test
for
uniformity
of
rotating
speed
with
the
sprinkler
mounted
on
the
vertical
riser
operate
the
sprinkler
at
its
test
pressure
and
measure
the
time
required
for
each
quarter
revolution
separately
means,
it
could
be
of
one
revolution
how
much
time
it
takes.
So,
if
one
quarter
it
is
taken
and
then
the
total
observation
it
should
be
repeated
for
5
revolutions
then
the
average
value
should
be
taken
and
then
accordingly ,
the
per
the
test
value,
it
is
given
this
would
be
compared. So, extreme deviation from the average shall not exceed + - 12%.
Test
of
water
distribution
characteristics
is
done
as
per
the
specification
so
one
need
to
find
out
the
water
application
rate.
This
particular
water
application
rate
it
should
be
within
the
prescribed
limit
and
this
is
normally
given
for
each
sprinkler
and
that
should
match
with
the
infiltration capacity of the soil.
So,
this
h
is
given,
h
is
water
application
rate
in
millimetre
per
hour
is
given
by
the
volume
of
water
collected
multiplied
by
10
divided
by
the
area
of
the
collector
opening
that
is
can
opening
area
and
then
multiplied
by
the
1
by
test
duration
in
hour.
So,
this
will
give
us
the
water
application
rate
in
millimetre
per
hour.
So,
this
we
need
to
plot
the
curve
for
all
the
collector
where
the
observations
are
made.
And
this
particular
observation
it
is
a
function
of
the distance of each collector and sprinkler along the placed along the radius.
Test
of
range
for
effective
pressure
this
is
another
test
which
is
recommended.
So,
this
test
before
performing
this
test
they
keep
the
sprinkler
immersed
in
water
at
60
degree
centigrade
for
one
hour,
then
operate
the
sprinkler
for
10
minute
at
the
test
pressure.
We
need
to
mount
the
sprinkler
nozzle
on
the
riser
and
then
increase
the
water
pressure
from
0
to
the
pressure
at
which
sprinkler
begins
to
rotate
steadily
in
one
direction.
Operate
the
sprinkler
at
this
pressure
for
2
minutes.
Then
we
need
to
increase
the
pressure
gradually
and
reach
up
to
the
maximum
pressure
then
take
the
observation
or
once
it
achieved
after
a
1
minute,
then
find
out
the
values
repeat
the
test
that
is
sprinkler
inclined
10
inches
from
the
vertical.
So,
this
is
at
a
particular
angle
of
inclination
the
sprinkler
shall
rotate
consistently
in
one
direction
throughout the entire range between minimum and maximum ef fective pressure.
So,
we
discussed
about
all
those
tests
please
refer
these
references,
internet
differences
about
these
tests,
these
are
available
in
bureau
of
Indian
standards
and
also
international
standard
organization that test code one should refer .
And
then
let
us
summarize
this
particular
lecture.
We
discussed
about
the
evolution
of
stability .
We
discussed
about
the
duration
as
well
as
performance
of
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
components
according
to
bureau
of
Indian
standards
specification.
In
the
forthcoming
lecture
we
will
discuss
about
solar
photovoltaic
system
for
irrigation
