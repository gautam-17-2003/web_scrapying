Tutorial 1 1- Numerical Examples on Economics of Micr o Irrigation System
Hello,
participants.
I
welcome
you
to
Lecture
58
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
subject.
Lecture
58
is
Tutorial
11.
And,
this
Tutorial
11
is
on
the
numerical
problems
of
economics
of
micro
irrigation
system.
We
dealt
several
topics
related
to
micro
irrigation
system.
And,
its
economic
evaluation
is
very
important.
So,
we
discussed
in
theory
class
about
how
to
evaluate
the
economics
of
micro
irrigation
system.
And,
a
system
can
be
made
feasible
or
operational,
when
it
is
economically
viable
and
it
can
be
adopted
by
the
community .
So,
let
us get into the economics of micro irrigation system.
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
will
deal
with
problems
where
benefit
cost
is
evaluated.
We
will
deal
with
the
break
even
analysis
is
being
done.
We
will
also
deal
with
how
to
determine
the
economic
pipe
size
selection
by
considering
the
cost
of
energy,
by
considering
the
size
of
the pipeline, by considering the criteria for critical flow velocity .
So,
Question
1,
in
Question
1,
we
have
been
given
a
Banana
crop
is
cultivated
in
1
hectare
area.
Drip
irrigation
system
has
been
installed
to
irrigate
Banana
crop.
Total
cost
incurred
to
produce
875
quintal
per
hectare
of
Banana
is
rupees
43,000.
The
Banana
is
sold
at
the
rate
of
rupees
300
per
quintal.
When
drip
irrigation
system
has
been
used,
there
is
a
saving
in
water .
And,
from
this
saving
in
water ,
0.8
hectare
additional
area
is
cultivated.
And,
this
has,
when
we
are
cultivating
additional
area,
this
gives
additional
cost
or
expenditure
of
34,400
rupees.
We
are
required
to
find
out
benefit
cost
ratio
and
additional
net
extra
income
due
to
drip
irrigation.
So,
total
area
under
drip
irrigation
system,
now,
1
hectare
plus
0.8
hectare.
So,
it
has
become
total
area
is
1.8
hectare.
Now ,
individually ,
when
we
have
been
also
given
that
for
cultivation
of
the
Banana
from
1
hectare
area,
the
cost
comes
to
43,000
rupees.
And
then,
from
1
hectarearea,
the
production
is
coming
as
875
quintal
per
hectare.
Now ,
the
cost
of
production
from
0.8 hectare area is 34,400 rupees. The Banana is being sold rupees 300 per quintal.
So,
these
are
the
data
available
to
us.
From
these
data,
we
are
required
to
obtain
benefit
cost
ratio.
So,
the
total
cost
of
production
to
grow
Banana
crop
is
cost
required
for
1
hectare
and
cost
required
for
0.8
hectare.
So,
cost
of
production
of
1
hectare
is
given
as
43,000
rupees
and
cost
of
production
from
0.8
hectare
is
given
as
34,400
rupees.
So,
sum
of
these
2
values,
43,000
plus
34,400,
we
get
77,400
rupees.
This
is
the
total
cost
of
production
to
grow
Banana
in 1.8 hectare.
Now ,
we
will
work
out
selling
price.
So,
selling
price
of
the
Banana
from
1
hectare,
selling
price
of
the
Banana
from
0.8
hectare,
this
will
become
the
total
selling
price.
So,
cost
of
means
production
we
know .
The
production
is
875
quintal
per
hectare.
Selling
price
is
rupees
300.
Here,
same
thing
that
it
is
from
0.8
hectare.
So,
the
production
from
0.8
hectare
is
0.8
times 875.
So,
so
many
quintals
we
will
get
from
0.8
hectare
and
that
will
be
multiplied
by
300.
So,
if
we
are
multiplying
by
300
and
then
we
are
getting
the
total
selling
price
from
1
hectare
is
262,500
rupees
from
1
hectare
and
210,000
rupees
from
0.8
hectare.
So,
total
cost
from
selling
price
from
1.8
hectare
is
472,500
rupees.
So,
the
benefit
obtained
after
selling,
then,
what we will do?
The
selling
price
from
the
1.8
hectare
is
472,500
minus
the
production
cost
from
1.8
hectare
is
77,400.
So,
this
is
the
benefit.
So,
net
benefit
from
1.8
hectare
is
395,100.
So,
benefit
cost
ratio
can
be
obtained.
That
is
a
net
benefit
divided
by
the
cost
of
production.
So,
net
benefit
is
395,100 divided by 77,400. So, this gives the value of 5.1.
When
we
are
calculating
gross
benefit
cost
ratio,
this
is
the
net
benefit
cost
ratio.
This
has
got
the
real
meaning.
But,
when
we
are
interested
someone
is
interested
to
get
the
gross
benefit
cost
ratio,
then
in
that
case,
we
are
required
to
find
out
from
this
value.
That
is
your
production,
your
total
benefit
which
we
are
getting.
So,
472,500
divided
by
the
production
cost that is 77,400. That is the gross benefit cost ratio.But,
as
far
as
the
net
benefit
is
to
concern,
so,
net
benefit
cost
ratio
it
is
395,100
divided
by
77,400.
So,
this
is
the
benefit
cost
ratio.
Now ,
additional
net
income
due
to
drip
irrigation
is
additional
income
minus
additional
cost.
So,
additional
income
is
210,000
minus
34,400.
So,
this
is
175,600
is
the
additional
net
income
due
to
adoption
of
drip
irrigation
system
for
cultivating Banana crop.
Question
2,
in
Question
2,
the
fixed
cost
of
manufacturing
a
micro
irrigation
system
component
accessory
is
given
as
rupees
38,900.
The
variable
cost
of
each
unit
of
accessory
product
is
rupees
5.
So,
each
unit
has
got
the
variable
cost
of
rupees
5.
And,
this
is
the
fixed
cost
of
producing
that
particular
accessory
product.
Now ,
the
selling
price
of
the
product
is
rupees 25 per unit.
Now ,
the
question
is
determine
the
quantity
of
above
mentioned
units
produced
at
break-even
point.
Means,
how
many
number
of
unit
one
should
produce
so
that
there
is
no
loss.
So,
that
we are required to find out from this particular question.
So,
we
have
been
given
in
this
question
fixed
cost
as
38,900.
We
have
been
given
selling
price
of
the
product
which
is
being
manufactured
from
that
particular
company
is
rupees
25
per
unit.
And
then,
variable
cost
involved
to
produce
this
particular
unit
is
rupees
5
per
unit.
So,
from
this
particular
given
data,
we
are
required
to
find
out
how
many
number
of
unit
one
should produce at break-even points.
So, break-even point is estimated by using the expression.
𝐵𝐸𝑃= 𝑇𝐹𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝑉𝐶𝑃()
That
is
a
total
fixed
cost
divided
by
selling
price
minus
variable
cost
per
unit
of
production.
So,
we
have
been
we
have
got
total
fixed
cost.
We
have
got
variable
cost
per
unit
of
production.
We
have
got
selling
price
of
per
unit
of
production.
So,
we
just
simply
we
will
substitute and get the value.
𝐵𝐸𝑃= 3890025−5()=1945 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑠So,
BEP
that
is
break-even
point
is
1,945
number
of
units.
If
it
is
produced,
it
will
be
at
break-even point.
Question
3,
in
Question
3,
we
are
given
the
total
cost
of
drippers,
manifold,
screen
filter ,
venturi,
fertilizer
tank.
All
these
components
of
drip
irrigation
system
unit
is
kept
under
Group
A.
Means,
drip
emitters,
manifold,
screen
filter ,
venturi,
fertilizer
tank,
it
is
kept
under
Group
A.
And,
this
has
been
worked
out
as
18,600
rupees
for
1
hectare
area.
Now ,
the
another
component
of
the
drip
system
that
is
a
lateral
and
lateral
which
is
used
in
for
the
crop
which is at 2 meter by 2 meter geometry is rupees 32,585.
This
is
item
in
Group
B.
So,
there
are
2
items.
One
is
means
one
items
which
are
under
Group
A
are
drip
emitters,
manifold,
screen
filter ,
venturi.
Cost
is
18,600.
Under
the
item
Group
B,
it
is
lateral.
The
cost
is
32,585.
The
bank
interest
rate
is
12%.
And
then
the
life
of
the
Group
A
means
these
components
which
are
used
under
Group
A,
the
life
of
those
components
is
10
years.
Life
of
the
item
Group
B
is
7
years.
So,
for
these
2
groups,
the
life
is
also
different.
That
is
10
years
and
7
years.
We
are
required
to
determine
the
annual
cost
of
the
drip
systems
of
components
in
Group
A
and
also
Group
B.
So,
we
will
work
out
individual annual cost for the Group A and Group B.
So,
in
this
question,
we
have
been
given
interest
rate
as
12%.
And,
for
items
under
Group
A
that
the
life
of
the
system
is
10
years.
And
then,
the
capital
recovery
factor
for
the
Group
A
is
given by
𝐶𝑅𝐹=𝑖(1+𝑖)𝑛
(1+𝑖)𝑛−1
So,
this
is
for
any
item
whether
it
is
a
group.
This
is
a
general
formula.
Now ,
for
Group
A,
only n and then the interest rate is to be put up.
Same
formula
will
be
used
for
Group
B
to
find
out
the
capital
recovery
factor
for
Group
B.
Only
in
that
case,
n
will
be
7.
So,
for
n
equal
to
10
and
the
bank
interest
rate
is
12%.
So,
substituting
the
values
of
i,
we
are
getting
the
capital
recovery
factor
for
items
in
Group
A
is
0.177.
So,
annual
cost
we
are
getting
is
3,292.2
rupees.
This
is
the
annual
cost
for
the
items
under Group A.Now ,
capital
recovery
factor
for
Group
B
is
the
same
formula.
The
n
is
the
only
factor
which
is
7
years
and
then
interest
rate
is
same.
So,
we
are
getting
capital
recovery
factor
with
7
years
of
the
life
of
the
components
and
12
per
cent
is
the
prevailing
bank
interest
rate
is
0.219.
Now ,
this
annual
cost
of
the
Group
B
is
your
capital
recovery
factor
multiplied
by
the
fixed
cost.
So,
capital
recovery
factor
is
0.219
multiplied
by
32,585.
It
gives
us
7,136.1 1
rupees for the item under Group B.
Now ,
annual
cost
means
when
we
are
taking
total
system
cost.
So,
annual
cost
of
the
drip
irrigation
system
components
in
Group
A
and
Group
B
is
estimated.
So,
we
have
got
this
value
as
3,292.2
plus
7,136.1 1.
So,
total
cost
is
10,428.31.
This
is
the
total
annual
cost
for
the
drip irrigation system components in Group A and Group B. So, this is our answer .
Question
4,
we
have
been
given
a
PVC
pipe
of
200
meter
long.
This
is
the
length
of
the
pipeline
which
carries
water
at
the
flow
rate
of
10
liter
per
second,
a
pipeline
of
200
meter
long
which
is
carrying
water
10
liter
per
second.
This
is
the
dischar ge
it
is
carrying.
The
coefficient
for
Hazen
William’ s
equation,
C
is
150
for
the
pipe
material.
And,
the
critical
flow
velocity is 1.5 meter per second.
So,
the
Hazen
William’ s
equation
is
used
to
estimate
head
loss
due
to
friction.
And,
in
this
equation,
there
is
one
constant
which
coefficient
which
comes
that
will
depend
upon
the
type
of
pipe
material.
So,
value
of
C
it
varies
from
120
to
150.
Of
course,
it
will
again
change
if
it
is
a
cast
iron
pipeline
if
it
is
aluminium
pipeline.
But,
in
drip
irrigation
system,
we
are
using
plastic pipes.
So,
range
of
C,
normally ,
it
is
120
to
150
and
these
plastic
pipeline
could
be
made
up
of
the
LDPE,
LLDPE,
PVC,
and
HDPE.
So,
there
this
could
be
the
pipeline.
So,
here
C
is
that
is
the
coefficient
which
we
will
be
using
that
is
given
as
a
C
equal
to
150.
And
then,
another
point
it
is
given
the
critical
flow
velocity
is
1.5
meter
per
second.
The
expected
life
of
the
pipe
is
20 years. So, 20 years is considered as a life of the pipes.
Now ,
electric
motor
coupled
pump
operates
1500
hours
in
a
year.
And,
this
pump
has
an
efficiency
of
70%.
So,
efficiency
that
means
of
the
pump
is
70%.
And,
it
is
operating
1500hours
in
a
year.
Electricity
cost
is
rupees
7
per
kilowatt
hour.
Means,
1
unit
it
is
costing
rupees
7.
The
fuel
use
factor
for
electricity
is
0.88.
Means,
this
factor
is
dimensionless.
That
is kilowatt hour divided by kilowatt hour . So, this is 0.88.
The
per
meter
cost
of
PVC
pipeline
of
different
sizes
are
given
in
the
following
table.
So,
this
is
the
table.
Means,
the
pipes
are
of
63
millimeter ,
75
millimeter ,
90
millimeter ,
110
millimeter .
And
then,
their
corresponding
cost
is
also
available
which
is
varying
from
rupees
108
for
63
millimeter
pipeline
and
then
250
rupees
per
110
millimeter
pipeline.
Now ,
we
will
use
this
table.
As
the
table
which
is
available,
information
is
available.
Bank
interest
rate
is
9%.
9%
is
the
rate
of
interest
which
bank
will
charge.
We
are
required
to
determine
economical
pipe
size,
which
pipeline
from
the
63
to
110
millimeter
size
one
should
use
so
that this is economically viable in long run.
Now ,
once
again
I
am
reading
the
data
which
is
given
in
this
question.
Q
is
given
as
10
liter
per
second.
Length
of
the
PVC
pipeline
is
200
meter .
The
electricity
cost
is
rupees
7
per
kilowatt
hour.
The
time
of
operation
of
the
pump
in
a
year
is
1500.
The
efficiency
of
the
pump
is
70%.
Bank
interest
rate
is
9%.
Life
of
the
PVC
pipeline
which
is
used
as
10
years
and
then
this
is
the
factor
which
we
gave
that
this
is
the
fuel
use
factor
for
electricity .
That
is
Kf
equal
to
0.88.
The
Hazen
Williams
constant
C
equal
to
150
and
critical
velocity
is
1.5
meter per second.
Now ,
annual
cost
of
the
pipeline
is
computed.
As
we
have
done
in
the
previous
problem,
so,
we will be using the expression.
(present worth)𝐴𝐶=𝐶𝑅𝐹×𝑃𝑊
That
annual
cost
is
given
by
capital
recovery
factor
multiplied
by
present
worth
value
of
the
any product or any item. So, CRF is estimated, so CRF is given by
𝐶𝑅𝐹=𝑖×1+𝑖()𝑛 
1+𝑖()𝑛 −1
So,
i
is
9%.
So,
we
are
putting
here
the
value
of
i
is
0.09
into
1
plus
0.09
to
the
power
20
because
n
is
20
years
divided
by
1
plus
0.09
to
the
power
20
minus
1.
So,
when
we
are
substituting,
we
get
this
expression,
the
numerator
as
0.5
and
denominator
as
4.60.
So,
CRF
is
0.1087.
So,
annual
cost
of
63
millimeter
pipeline,
we
are
substituting
the
value.
We
havegot
this
CRF
at
0.1087
multiplied
by
because
this
is
a
200
meter
line
long
pipeline.
And
then,
for
63
millimeter
pipeline
in
the
table,
we
have
been
given
108
rupees
per
meter ,
so,
200
into
108. So, we are getting the value of annual cost of 63 millimeter pipeline as 2,347.92.
Similarly ,
we
will
calculate
the
value
of
annual
cost
of
the
pipeline
for
other
diameters.
So,
when
we
have
calculated
same
way
we
have
been
given
these
pipelines.
We
have
been
given
the
price
also.
And
then,
total
price
we
are
getting
and
then
multiplying
with
the
capital
recovery
factor
which
is
a
constant
because
the
bank
interest
rate
is
9%
and
then
n
equal
to
20
years. So, we are getting the annual cost of the pipeline.
So,
annual
cost
for
63
millimeter
pipeline
is
2,347
rupees
92
paisa.
For
other
pipelines
of
75
millimeter ,
you
can
see
3,261
rupees.
And
similarly ,
for
110
millimeter
pipeline,
it
is
5,435
rupees.
So,
now,
we
have
got
the
annual
cost.
Now ,
let
us
try
to
find
out
the
annual
electricity
cost
for
these
pipelines.
So,
for
getting
the
Cp
value,
that
is
annual
electricity
cost.
First,
we
will
calculate
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
from
these
pipelines.
So,
head
loss
due
to
friction
from
these pipelines can be calculated by using the Hazen William’ s equation.
ℎ𝑓=1.212×1010×𝐿×𝑄𝐶
(
)1.852×𝐷−4.87
This
is
the
unit
constant
because
we
are
using
a
specific
unit.
So,
this
particular
is
a
constant
which
will
come
out
of
the
unit
which
we
are
using.
So,
into
L
is
the
length
of
pipeline.
Q
is
the
dischar ge.
So,
Q
is
the
dischar ge
in
liter
per
second.
C
is
the
coefficient,
D
is
the
diameter
of pipeline in millimeter .
So,
length
is
given
200
meter .
Dischar ge,
we
have
been
already
given
in
this
question.
Dischar ge
is
available.
And
then,
C
is
given.
Diameter
of
pipeline
63,
75,
90,
110,
these
values
are
known.
So,
we
will
be
calculating
this
thing.
So,
first,
we
will
first
calculate
the
water horsepower . So, water power or water horsepower is estimated by using the expression.
𝑊𝑃=9.8×𝑄×𝐻𝑡1000
Now ,
total
head
here
Ht
which
is
it
is
used
here
as
such
the
value
of
Hf
which
we
are
calculating.
And
then,
break
horsepower ,
whatever
the
WP
that
is
water
horsepower
we
havegot
that
is
to
be
divided
by
the
pump
efficiency .
It
will
give
the
break
power
or
break
horsepower we can say .
So, and then, the Cp, that is the annual electricity cost is calculated by using the expression.
𝐶𝑝=𝐵𝑃×𝑇×𝐶𝑓𝐾𝑓
That
is
Cp
equal
to
BP
that
is
the
break
horsepower
or
break
power
multiplied
by
the
total
time
of
operation
in
hours
and
then,
Cf
is
the
cost
of
electricity
that
this
is
also
given
per
unit
and
then,
Kf,
which
was
the
factor
that
the
fuel
use
factor .
So,
Cf
is
known
to
us.
Time
of
operation
is
known
to
us.
Break
horsepower ,
we
are
calculating
from
the
water
horsepower .
And,
water
horsepower
is
calculated
by
using
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
from
the
Hazen
William’ s equation.
So,
those
are
the
steps.
Now ,
let
us
try
to
get
the
value
of
hf.
So,
hf
is
calculated
by
substituting
the
value
of
this
is
your
unit
constant
multiplication
and
this
is
a
200
meter
L.
This
is
the
dischar ge
in
10
liter
per
second.
And,
C,
this
is
your
C
value
as
50
and
63
millimeter
the
pipeline.
So,
when
we
are
multiplying
all
these,
we
get
27.77
meter
as
head
loss due to friction. And, this value is used to calculate Ht.
So,
this
is
as
such
it
is
used
for
Ht.
And
then,
9.8
into
10,
that
is
Q,
so,
divided
by
1000.
So,
we
are
getting
Wp
as
2.72
for
63
millimeter
pipeline.
And,
for
brake
power ,
here,
this
2.72
divided
by
the
pump
efficiency
of
0.7.
So,
we
get
3.89.
And
then,
Cp,
this
is
means
cost
of
electricity .
So,
this
we
are
getting
the
value
of
brake
power .
That
is
3.89
multiplied
by
the
time
of
operation
1500
hours
and
multiplied
by
electricity
that
is
7
hour
and
divided
by
Kf.
So,
this
value
is
your
7,
is
the
electricity
cost
per
unit.
That
is
7
rupees
per
unit
divided
by
Kf.
That
is
0.88.
So,
for
63
millimeter
pipeline,
the
Cp,
annual
electricity
cost
is
coming
46,414
rupees 77 paisa.
So,
then,
we
will
also
find
out
how
much
is
the
velocity
of
flow
it
takes
place
from
the
pipeline. So, velocity from the pipeline is given by
𝑉= 𝑄𝐴=𝑄
π4×𝑑2
(
)=10×10−3
π4×0.0632
(
)=3.2 𝑚 𝑠−1So,
when
we
are
putting
this
in
a
cubic
meter
and
this
is
also
in
a
square
meter ,
so,
we
get
the
velocity
is
V
equal
to
3.2
meter
per
second.
Similarly ,
for
all
pipes
of
other
diameters
75
millimeter , 90 millimeter , 110 millimeter , all those steps have been calculated.
So,
for
63
millimeter
pipeline,
we
have
got
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
27.77.
We
calculated
water
power
as
a
2.72.
Then,
we
calculated
brake
horsepower
as
a
3.89.
Just
now
we
calculated
the
velocity
of
flow
is
3.21.
And
then,
annual
pipeline
cost,
we
got
2,347
rupees
92
paisa.
And
then,
annual
electricity
cost
is
46,414.77.
And
then,
total
cost
means
annual
cost
of
the
pipe
plus
annual
electricity
cost.
So,
total
annual
cost
is
coming
48,762
rupees
69
paisa
is
the
total
cost.
Similarly ,
for
all
other
pipeline,
we
have
calculated
head
loss
due
to
friction
from
75
millimeter
pipeline.
That
is
11.88
water
power
we
calculated.
Brake
power ,
we
have
calculated.
Critical
velocity ,
we
have
calculated.
Annual
cost
of
the
pipeline,
we
have
calculated. Annual electricity , we have calculated.
In
the
same
way,
and
then,
we
are
getting
total
annual
cost
of
75
millimeter
pipe
size
is
23,103.61
rupees.
Similarly ,
for
90
millimeter
pipeline,
we
have
calculated,
which
is
coming
12,831
rupees
21
paisa;
110
millimeter
pipeline,
we
are
getting
8,537.27
rupees.
So,
what
we
are
seeing?
As
the
pipe
size
increases,
there
is
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
pipeline.
There
was
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
pipeline
because
the
size
matters.
So,
what
we
see
here
the
annual
cost
of
the
pipeline
is
increasing.
Annual
cost
of
the
pipeline
for
the
63
millimeter
pipeline
was
2,347.92,
then,
for
75,
3,200
and
then
it
is
coming
5,435
rupees.
So,
annual
cost
has
increased
for
the
pipeline.
But,
electricity
cost,
you
can
see
here,
as
the
pipe
size
increase,
there is a reduction in the head loss due to friction. And, there is a significant head loss.
So,
this
significant
head
loss
that
has
caused
decrease
in
the
annual
electricity
charge.
So,
annual
electricity
charge
for
the
63
millimeter
pipeline
was
as
high
as
46,414
rupees
77
paisa
which
has
now
come
to
3,102
rupees
27
paisa
when
we
are
using
110
millimeter
pipe
size.
So,
this
is
to
be
noted
that
the
cost
of
electricity
is
going
down
as
when
the
pipe
size
increases.
So,
total
cost
has
reduced.
And
then,
second
criteria
which
was
given
to
us
that
the
critical
velocity
should
not
exceed
1.5
meter
per
second.
So,
here
means
as
you
have
increased
the
size
of
the
pipeline,
what
we
are
seeing
that
the
velocity
through
the
pipeline
has
decreased.
But,
still,
it
was
more
than
1.5
meter
per
second.
So,
at
110
millimeter
pipesize,
the
critical
velocity
is
less
than
1.5.
So,
what
we
see
that
this
is,
so,
based
on
using
the
critical velocity criteria.
And
also,
the
annual
cost
total
annual
cost
including
the
size
of
the
annual
cost
of
the
pipeline
and
the
annual
electricity
charge,
so,
110
millimeter
pipe
is
most
economical.
So,
the
interpretation
once
again
I
am
reading
that
the
pipe
cost
increases
substantially
in
accordance
with
the
increase
in
the
pipe
size
whereas
energy
cost
decreases.
So,
energy
cost
for
the
63
millimeter
pipeline
is
almost
more
than
the
5
times
of
the
energy
cost
for
110
millimeter
pipe
size.
Whereas,
it
is
it
is
not
following
the
other
cases.
It
is
the
other
pipe
sizes
it
is
not
falling
under
the
velocity
criteria
of
1.5
meter
per
second.
So,
considering
the
1.5
meter
per
second
the velocity as well as the ener gy cost, so, 1 10 millimeter pipe size is most economical.
So,
we
worked
out
those
problems.
And,
for
more
problems,
you
can
refer
these
books
which
are given here. These books I have been referring in other topics also.
Let
us
summarize
this
lecture.
The
benefit
cost
analysis
part,
the
Banana
crop
we
have
estimated.
We
have
got
the
break-even
point
analysis
also
and
capital
recovery
factor .
We
worked
out
the
economical
pipe
size
diameter
selection
in
this
lecture.
And,
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
be
discussing
on
new
topic
that
is
on
precision
agriculture.
Thank you very much.
