Solar  Photovoltaic System for  Irrigation (Part 1)
Dear
participants
of
micro
irrigation
engineering
subject
I
invite
you
to
lecture
48.
In
lecture
46
and
47
we
discussed
the
standard
specifications
with
reference
to
our
Indian
coding
system.
So,
the
bureau
of
Indian
standards
discussed
how
the
different
sprinkler
as
well
as
drip
irrigation
system components they can be tested as per the given standards.
In
previous
lectures
we
discussed
about
design
of
the
micro
irrigation
system.
We
also
discussed
about
design
of
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
In
conventional
ways
of
operating
these
micro
irrigation
systems
or
sprinkler
irrigation
systems
we
use
electricity .
We
use
conventional
ways
of
giving
power
source
supply
to
operate
micro
irrigation
systems.
But
this
system
is
not
reliable
particularly
when
crops
need
irrigation
to
make
the
system
self-reliant
and
the
source
of
power
if
it is made available at the field itself.
So,
we
should
find
out
the
alternative
and
one
of
the
alternatives
is
using
solar
photovoltaic
systems
for
irrigation.
So,
in
today's
lecture
48
it
is
on
using
the
solar
PV
system
and
we
will
discuss
about
the
basic
fundamentals
of
the
solar
PV
system.
And
then
we
will
discuss
how
a
given solar PV  system can be integrated with a micro irrigation system in the coming lecture.
So,
let
us
start
with
the
solar
PV
system.
The
concept
covered
in
this
particular
lecture
is
solar
PV system and ener gy conversion and solar tracking system.
Let
us
go
further
deeper
on
this
particular
topic.
So,
we
know
that
energy
is
a
very
important
component
of
agriculture
and
energy
for
all
operations
starting
from
ploughing,
starting
from
seeding,
starting
from
transplanting,
irrigation,
and
there
are
various
other
operations
till
we
aregetting
the
produce
in
our
home.
There
are
various
field
operations
which
are
carried
out
and
these field operations require ener gy.
So,
energy
is
a
very
important
component
for
production
of
agriculture
produce.
So,
we
need
a
means
to
operate
this
one
so
we
have
got
the
conventional
source
of
energy.
So,
one
can
use
electricity
maybe
it
is
a
hydropower
generated
electricity
or
thermal
power .
So,
you
can
see
here
when
you
are
using
the
thermal
power
this
type
of
pollution
is
another
problem.
So,
environmental ef fects due to using the dif ferent fossil fuels generate ener gy.
Shortage
of
electricity
and
especially
in
the
rural
area,
remote
areas
where
grid
supply
is
not
available
that
is
another
problem.
So,
agriculture
to
get
all
throughout
the
year
production;
so,
we
need
a
sustainable
source
of
electricity
availability
so
that
all
throughout
the
year
cultivation
can
be
done.
So,
here
our
main
focus
is
on
irrigation
parts.
So,
you
are
seeing
here
that
whatever
the
source
of
energy
we
are
using.
We
need
to
operate
the
pump
to
make
the
irrigation
water
available
to
the
field
as
and
when
it
is
required.
So,
we
call
it
Agri-voltaic
and
alliance,
an
alliance
of
both
agricultural
and
photovoltaic
energy
production.
So,
this
is
the
important
component for using the photovoltaic system for irrigation purposes.
Now
we
know
the
sun
is
the
source
of
energy.
There
are
other
sources
of
energy
it
could
be
wind,
it
can
be
tidal
waves,
and
it
could
be
hydro
energy
depending
on
the
location
available.
So,
hydropower ,
biomass,
biofuel,
coal,
oil
these
are
the
primary
sources
of
energy.
Geothermal
is
a
chemical
reaction
and
radioactive
decay
inside
the
earth
this
also
produces
the
energy.
Tidal
energy, motion and the gravitational potential of the sun, moon and earth.
That
is
also
you
know
sun
takes
the
important
part
and
the
different
position
of
the
moon
and
earth
with
respect
to
the
sun
accordingly ,
the
tides
are
moving
and
then
it
generates
energy
for
useful
purposes.
Human
induced
nuclear
reaction.
So,
nuclear
power
plants
are
also
available
for
generation of electricity and this system is available.Renewable
energy
obtained
from
the
natural
as
well
as
persistent
flows
of
energy
occurring
in
the
immediate
environment.
So,
for
example
we
are
putting
renewable
energy.
So,
the
sun
is
the
obvious
source
of
energy.
Then
there
is
the
wind,
wave,
tidal.
These
are
the
other
kinds
of
energy.
So,
you
can
see
here
this
is
the
natural
environment
and
then
there
are
devices
which
are
used to convert this ener gy and bring it for use and then the environment sink it is this.
So,
the
green
or
alternate
source
of
the
energy
which
is
being
not
affecting
the
environment.
Non-renewable
obtained
from
the
static
source
of
energy
that
remains
under ground
unless
released
by
human
interaction.
So,
examples
are
nuclear
fuel,
fossil
fuels
but
it
has
finite
supplies
which
mean
one
needs
to
have
enough
radioactive
material
available.
But
it
has
got
a
finite
means of limited supply . And then it is a brown ener gy we say .
We
call
it
also
now
it
has
become
a
conventional
source
of
energy.
So,
we
see
here
the
resources
available
from
the
mines.
These
are
also
used
to
generate
electricity ,
generate
energy
for
agriculture purposes.
Now
here
my
talk
is
mainly
focused
on
solar
energy.
If
you
see
in
our
country
solar
energy
is
abundantly
available
and
here
68%
of
the
total
energy
it
has
a
potential
that
it
can
be
utilized.
So,
this
is
the
potential
68%
of
total
energy
which
can
be
utilized
where
68%
is
solar
and
it
has
got
a
750
Giga-W att
power .
Then
next
in
the
order
for
the
renewable
source
of
energy
is
wind.
So,
it
has got 300 Giga-W att power and wave that is a tidal wave.
And
then
another
side
that
is
in
the
range
of
wave
it
is
4%
that
is
a
41
Giga-W att.
And
tidal
energy
also
there
but
it
is
very
limited
1%
of
that
so,
total
energy
can
be
brought.
Now
my
talk
is
mainly
focusing
on
solar
energy.
The
distribution
or
availability
of
solar
radiation
annual
or
daily
global
solar
radiation
in
India
which
is
expressed
in
kilowatt
per
square
meter
per
day.
So,
this
varies
from
4.4
to
I
can
say
6.6
kilowatt
hour
per
square
meter
per
day.
So,
the
distribution
if
you
see
a
distribution
in
the
western
part
of
the
country
is
very
high
which
is
in
the
order
of
about
more
than
6
kilowatt
hour
per
square
meter .
And
then
this
part
is
low
because
of
the
cloudycondition.
So,
availability
of
solar
energy
in
the
north
eastern
part
is
lesser
and
also
the
coastal
regions are also having this type of problem.
So,
we
get
less
but
a
large
part
of
the
energy
which
can
be
utilized
for
our
country
in
a
very
big
way and the government of India is supporting this type of ener gy.
Now
coming
to
the
basic
fundamental
theory
of
how
photovoltaic
energy
it
converts
to
electricity .
So,
photovoltaic
systems
convert
sunlight
which
is
coming
from
the
source.
It
means
this
energy
is
coming
from
the
source
of
the
sun
and
that
is
directly
converted
to
electricity
and
these
processes
are
completely
solid
state
and
self-contained.
It
can
withstand
severe
weather
conditions. So, solar insulations which is falling on the solar panel.
So,
this
is
made
up
of
phosphorus-doped
N-type
the
solar
system
panel
consists
of
these
cells
and
these
cells
have
got
phosphorus-doped
and
boron-doped
N-type
and
then
they
convert
the
electricity .
When
it
interacts
with
this
and
it
converts
to
the
direct
current
that
is
DC
current.
And
this DC current if we are directly tagging one can use it for the generation of electricity .
So,
there
are
different
classification
charts
you
can
see
here.
So,
the
classification
of
solar
cell
technology
has
gone
considerable
development
and
their
lot
of
development
and
the
efficiency
of
the
system
has
also
improved.
And
the
cost
of
the
system
has
also
gone
down.
So,
this
could
be
you
know
the
solar
cell
technology
is
by
silicon
and
then
another
one
is
by
using
the
semiconductor compounds or it is by emer ging or novel material.
So,
silicon
could
be
crystalline,
amorphous
or
crystalline
can
be
a
single
crystalline
or
a
multi
crystalline.
Amorphous
material
it
could
be
hydro
generated
amorphous
silicon.
So,
this
could
be
like
this
and
then
semiconductor
compounds
can
be
chalcogenides
and
compounds
of
group
3
and
4.
Then
further
if
we
get
into
this
one
then
you
may
find
that
cadmium,
copper
zinc,
tin
sulphide, copper lithium.So,
this
is
another
kind
of
semiconductor
compound
which
is
being
used.
If
you
are
using
other
sources,
emer ging
other
novel
material.
So,
these
are
the
new
materials
which
have
been
it
is
going
on.
So,
the
solar
energy
which
is
being
converted
and
brought
for
the
irrigation
purpose.
And
the
silicon
solar
cells
are
made
up
of
monocrystalline
cells.
Mono
crystalline
cells
have
the
highest ef ficiency of about 26%.
When
we
call
it
a
polycrystalline
cell
it
has
got
efficiency
of
converting
the
energy
to
16%.
And
then amorphous material has got relatively less about 10% of the ener gy is converted.
So,
what
we
are
seeing
here
when
the
sun
is
the
source
of
energy
and
these
are
the
solar
radiations
which
fall
on
the
solar
cell.
Now
these
solar
plates
or
cells
could
be
arranged
in
a
series
or
parallel.
Then
it
is
brought
to
the
controller .
Then
the
controller
operates
the
motor
and
then
this
motor
is
coupled
with
the
pump.
And
then
from
the
pump
water
is
coming
from
the
source and then supplied to the irrigation system.
This
irrigation
I
am
putting
here
it
can
be
for
any
other
purpose.
So,
the
solar
system
can
be
used
for
supply
of
water .
It
can
be
for
drinking
water
supply
or
for
any
other
purpose
this
system
can
be
used.
So,
PV
irrigation
is
one
of
the
most
promising
alternatives
for
rural
electrification
slowly
this
work
is
going
on
in
a
bigger
way.
Idea
of
using
solar
energy
to
meet
the
water
needs
of crops began in the 1970s.
So,
as
early
as
in
1970
and
now
almost
50
years
it
has
come
and
then
there
is
a
lot
of
improvement
in
the
technology
as
far
as
the
material.
So,
just
now
I
was
telling
you
there
are
different
materials
which
are
used
for
making
these
cells
and
then
there
are
several
novel
materials
that
have
come
and
that
is
causing
the
improvement.
And
not
only
is
the
improvement
in the ef ficiency point of view , the cost of the system is also going down.
And
the
government
of
India
is
promoting
and
you
will
see
that
many
houses,
many
government
buildings
and
their
roofs
are
being
used
for
placing
these
PV
panels.
And
that
particular
panel
isthe
power
generator
being
supplied
to
the
grid.
So,
first
PV
irrigation
system
installation
was
carried
down
during
the
1970s
and
that
was
coupled
with
the
pump
to
direct
current
motors.
The
DC
motors
were
connected
initially
but
now
improvement
has
come
that
it
is
connected
directly
with the PV  array that used to be there.
Now
there
is
improvement
it
has
been
brought
that
it
can
convert
from
DC
to
AC.
Now
PV
irrigation
systems
are
composed
of
two
primary
and
highly
interrelated
subsystems,
namely
the
PV
subsystem.
And
this
is
responsible
for
supplying
the
energy
required
and
the
irrigation
subsystem
which
demands
energy.
So,
for
the
PV
irrigation
system
to
perform
properly
the
relationship
between
these
two
subsystems
has
to
be
established
by
applying
rational
and
scientifically based methods.
Now
when
we
are
talking
about
solar
PV
systems
in
general
it
has
got
some
advantages.
One
advantage
which
is
very
clear
is
that
it
is
abundantly
available.
There
is
nothing
like
anyone
has
to
pay
for
getting
solar
energy.
It
is
pollution
free,
it
is
of
low
maintenance.
The
system
is
absolutely
reliable
and
free
from
cost.
Like
we
are
paying
money
for
diesel,
we
are
paying
money for electricity . So, from that point of view it is free.
It
is
independent
from
the
grid
and
it
has
got
a
long
life,
about
25
years.
This
means
the
system
can
work
and
of
course
when
we
look
from
the
25
years
whatever
expenses
we
are
making
in
the
initial
way,
but
over
the
year
when
we
are
working
it
will
reduce
the
cost.
Now
when
the
pumping
part
is
concerned
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view
the
PV
pumping
systems
are
gaining
interest due to their numerous advantages.
They
do
not
depend
on
the
existence
of
an
electricity
distribution
network
which
is
a
common
problem
in
rural
areas.
The
system
is
highly
reliable.
It
means
we
can
bring
the
portable
electric
generator
to
consume
fuels
and
that
is
in
the
case
of
conventional
systems.
It
means
it
pollutes
the
environment.
So,
those
are
the
limitations
of
existing
conventional
ways
of
generatingelectricity .
Their
design
is
simple.
It
does
not
necessarily
require
a
battery
bank.
They
have
a
long life or are highly reliable and require minimal maintenance.
Now
a
PV
system
or
based
irrigation
system
I
will
say
that
can
be
classified
in
two
ways.
So,
one
way
of
classification
is
type
of
power
plant.
This
power
plant
can
be
stand-alone
plant
or
this
can
be
a
grid-connected
plant.
So,
when
we
are
talking
about
hybrid
system
it
could
be
and
according
to
the
type
of
irrigation
system
you
are
putting
the
tank
at
elevation
point
and
direct
pumping.
So,
here
when
we
are
talking
about
stand-alone
plants
you
can
see
here
that
this
is
the
stand-alone.
We
have
a
PV
panel
then
we
have
got
the
solar
pumping
system.
The
water
is
being
taken
with
the
help
of
a
pump
then
water
is
stored
and
then
it
is
being
used
for
irrigation.
So,
the
stand-alone
plants
are
those
that
are
not
connected
to
the
grid
and
it
consists
of
a
PV
panel
and
occasionally
a
storage
system
guarantees
electricity
supply
when
insolation
is
low
at
night
time.
So, this can also be fed to the grid and then it can be used during night time.
Because
PV
produces
direct
current
so,
inverter
is
required.
This
is
the
important
thing
that
you
have
to
convert
direct
current
DC
to
AC.
So,
an
inverter
is
required.
Stand-alone
plants
are
advantageous
in
isolated
areas
where
the
electric
grid
is
not
near
both
from
the
technical
and
economic point of view . They can ef ficiently replace the generator set that is being used.
So,
grid
connected
plants
can
draw
power
from
the
grid
during
the
hours
when
PV
generators
cannot
produce
enough
energy
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
consumer .
So,
this
is
the
advantage
of
the
grid
connected
plants.
On
the
contrary ,
when
a
PV
system
produces
more
energy
than
is
required
surplus
energy
which
is
generated
from
the
solar
PV
system
can
be
fed
to
the
grid
and
we can store this ener gy in the battery also and that can be used. So, that is another advantage.
The
different
state
governments
when
the
particular
unit
how
many
units
it
has
been
given
there
it
is
the
users
are
getting
the
advantage
of
the
electricity
supply
or
metering
chart.
Hybrid
systemcan
have
both
a
PV
plant
as
well
as
the
conventional
source
of
energy
when
the
electricity
supply
is low then the hybrid system can also be used. Both types of system can be utilized.
Pumping
to
an
elevated
tank.
So,
here
storing
the
water
in
an
elevated
tank
means
it
is
a
very
simple
thing.
Then
water
is
taken
from
the
source
which
is
at
the
lower
elevation
and
then
the
solar
pump.
So,
a
PV
operated
pump
is
used
to
feed
water
which
is
at
the
higher
elevation.
So,
that
is
the
one
way
and
then
by
using
the
gravity
system
the
irrigation
can
be
done.
Direct
pumping that is a stand-alone direct pumping is what you see here.
There
is
a
solar
panel
and
then
this
pump
is
connected
with
the
panel
and
then
water
is
being
supplied
and
then
irrigation
is
given.
So,
this
method
needs
matching
of
energy
production
with
irrigation
demand.
That
is
a
very
critical
issue
and
where
enough
information
and
data
are
to
be
analysed for a place and accordingly the design has to be made.
Now
the
photovoltaic
irrigation
system
consists
of
a
photovoltaic
PV
power
plant.
It
has
got
a
power
controller ,
it
has
got
pumping
unit,
it
has
got
irrigation
system.
So,
the
main
components
of
a
PV
power
plant
are
it
has
a
PV
module,
solar
trackers.
So,
PV
module
that
you
already
might
have
seen,
it
consists
of
an
array
of
PV
cells
and
these
cells
are
connected
to
form
a
circuit
in
series
or
in
parallel
to
increase
the
output
voltage
and
current
up
to
the
desired
value.
So,
main
feature
of
the
PV
array
is
to
produce
direct
current
between
its
two
terminals
when
they
are
illuminated by solar light.
So,
several
characteristic
points
are
to
be
distinguished
on
this
curve.
So,
one
is
the
short
circuit
current,
the
current
that
is
obtained
from
the
cell
when
the
voltage
at
its
terminal
is
0.
That
is
V
=
0.
Open
circuit
voltage,
the
voltage
for
which
current
drawn
from
the
cell
is
0,
I
=
0
if
the
device
is
kept
in
an
open
circuit.
It
will
self-polarize
with
a
certain
voltage
that
is
the
largest.
It
can
withstand the generation region.So,
we
can
say
that
it
is
the
voltage
to
open
circuit
which
we
are
given
by
symbol
Voc.
It
is
the
maximum
voltage
achieved
by
a
solar
cell
in
silicon
cells.
Then
peak
power
is
another
term
which
is
important.
This
peak
power
is
the
power
supplied
by
a
direct
current
motor .
The
power
delivered
to
the
load
when
P
equal
to
I
into
V.
And
there
will
be
operating
point
where
we
will
get
I
maximum
and
V
maximum.
So,
that
point
is
to
be
taken
for
a
particular
solar
insolation
when we are getting it.
This
is
I-V
performance
and
when
we
are
plotting
the
data
you
can
see
this
is
cell
current,
this
is
cell
voltage
and
what
we
are
seeing
is
the
maximum
power
area
which
is
falling
and
this
is
the
point
at
which
the
voltage
is
also
maximum.
And
then
I
maximum,
this
is
also
maximum
at
this
particular
point.
So,
we
select
ideal
condition
for
one
solar
day
that
is
1000
watt
per
square
meter .
For
this
particular
case
this
is
the
case
this
kind
of
a
thing
where
I
maximum
means
maximum
current and maximum voltage is obtained.
Fill factor that is FF is given by
Voc
is
the
open
circuit
voltage
and
Isc
is
the
short
circuit
current.
So,
this
particular
ratio
product
of
this
divided
by
this
gives
the
FF
and
then
sharper
the
characteristic
curve
of
this
cell
that
gives
the higher value of FF and PP . That can be given by
And
this
gives
your
PP
value.
Now
energy
conversion
efficiency
is
another
term
which
is
important
for
all
our
calculations.
So,
this
efficiency
is
given
as
the
ratio
between
the
power
delivered and power input. This is your input power . So,
So, I-V  curve can be fitted by using the following equation which is given by
Where,
e = the char ge of the electron,
m = the diode ideality factor 1 < m < 2,
k = the Boltzman constant
T = the absolute temperature.
So, this way I-V  curve can be obtained by using this expression.
Now
photo
voltaic
modules
arrangement.
These
modules
arrangement
are
arranged
into
different
series-parallel
or
parallel-series
combinations.
So,
this
is
what
we
see
here.
You
can
see
here
the
arrangement
is
in
a
series
order .
But
when
we
look
at
this
one
this
is
in
the
parallel
part.
So,
how
the
voltage
is
increasing
when
they
are
arranged
in
the
series
and
the
current
is
increasing
when
going in, they are arranged in parallel.
So,
set
of
modules
with
its
own
connections,
framework,
this
constitutes
the
PV
generator .
So,
by
using this expression which I will not read is available here.
Where,
N
P
= no. of module in parallel
N
S
= no. of modules in series
V
G
= Generator Voltage (V).
So,
using
this
expression
one
can
find
out
what
is
the
value
of
I
G
.
So,
number
of
modules
in
parallel
means
we
will
calculate
how
many
number
of
modules
are
in
the
parallel
arrangement,
number
of
modules
in
the
series
and
then
the
generated
voltage
that
will
also
be
used
to
obtain
the value of I
G
.
So,
another
important
part
to
get
the
maximum
energy
is
solar
tracking
system.
Basically ,
solar
tracking
system
is
the
system
at
which
maximum
solar
insolation
should
fall
on
the
solar
panel.
So,
the
mechanism
involved
is
the
part
of
tracking
which
is
responsible
for
providing
the
follower
with
precision
in
tracking.
So,
this
could
be
one-axis
tracker
or
it
can
be
two-axis
tracker , idea that what type of mechanism it follows can be single-axis or two-axis tracker .
So,
here
you
can
see
this
is
a
one-axis
tracker .
So,
north-south
horizontal
axis
tracking
where
this
north-south
and
this
c
=
90
degree.
This
is
one
way
and
then
another
one
is
by
taking
the
polar
tracking.
So,
north-south
polar
axis
tilting
is
performed.
So,
rotation
is
adjusted
in
such
a
way
that
tracker
follows
the
meridian
of
the
earth
that
containing
the
sun.
So,
this
way
the
angular
velocity
is
maintained
at
15
degrees
per
hour
this
way
this
will
be
moved
along
with
the
to
track
the solar intensity it is then both in the northern latitudes and in places near the equator .
So,
we
can
see
here
east-west
horizontal
tracking.
This
is
another
way
of
tracking
where
maximum
energy
can
be
generated.
So,
rotation
axis
is
placed
parallel
to
the
ground
in
east-west
direction.
And
this
is
done
in
such
a
way
that
it
should
follow
the
sun
at
its
altitude
angle
and
then
the
position
of
panel
every
day
due
to
the
sun
declination.
So,
this
way
we
follow
the
east-west tracking.
Azimuthal
axis
tracking
is
another
way
of
tracking.
So,
there
are
different
tracking
system
which
is
followed
to
get
this.
So,
you
can
see
here
when
we
are
doing
the
azimuthal
axis
tracking.
In
this
system
the
tilting
angle
of
the
surface
is
constant
and
equal
to
the
latitude
of
the
place.
So,
this way the azimuthal axis tracking.
Two-axis tracking.
In
this
case
of
two
axis
tracking,
we
can
see
here
the
maximum
energy
collection
can
be
achieved
because
due
to
its
total
freedom
of
movement.
So,
this
type
of
tracking
also
it
is
also
known as dual axis tracking.Driving
motor
is
another
component.
Here
the
most
common
driving
mechanism
is
an
electric
motor
because
it
allows
simpler
and
precise
control
of
the
movement.
So,
alternative
current
motors
are
mostly
used
than
the
DC
ones.
Now
DC
ones
are
normally
converted
to
the
AC
motors.
For
one-axis
tracker
only
one
motor
is
required
or
when
we
have
got
two
axes,
tracker
and then two motors are required.
So,
solar
tracking
control
and
this
could
be
a
feedback
type
of
control
where
the
sensors
are
placed
to
detect
the
energy
depending
on
the
particular
type
of
insolation
condition,
cloudy
conditions.
So,
based
on
the
photovoltaic
sensors
which
are
used
are
giving
feedback
accordingly .
Open
loop
controller
is
another
kind
of
device.
Here
this
control
technique
uses
microprocessor
but
it
does
not
need
any
sensors
to
determine
the
position
of
sun.
So,
movement
of
the
sun
can
be
predicted
by
astronomic
equations.
Those
equations
are
utilized
to
get
the
position
accordingly
this open loop gives the input information.
Then
there
are
other
ways
to
install
the
system.
So,
one
side
of
greenhouses
can
be
used
to
collect
the
electricity
and
the
greenhouses
become
self-suf ficient
to
operate.
There
are
different
units inside the greenhouse for irrigation purpose, for operating for gers and other devices.
You
can
see
these
are
the
roof
of
the
bigger
greenhouses
where
this
greenhouse's
roof
can
be
used.
Now
such
type
of
installations
these
are
available
in
plenty
in
the
rooftop
as
well
as
bridges, tunnels, canals are also being covered by using the solar panels.
So,
we
have
discussed
these
topics
in
detail.
And
then
for
more
details
you
are
advised
to
refer
these references to go into detail about the solar PV  system.So,
in
order
to
summarize
the
whole
lecture,
we
discussed
about
the
importance
of
solar
energy.
We
discussed
about
the
different
energy
sources
which
are
used
for
irrigation
purpose.
Solar
PV
system,
its
concept,
and
how
does
it
work,
and
then
classification
and
components
of
solar
PV
system.
We
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
tracking
system
and
controller .
Now
in
forthcoming
lecture
we
will
discuss
how
to
integrate
solar
PV
systems
with
irrigation.
So,
this
will be in the next lecture. Thank you very much.
