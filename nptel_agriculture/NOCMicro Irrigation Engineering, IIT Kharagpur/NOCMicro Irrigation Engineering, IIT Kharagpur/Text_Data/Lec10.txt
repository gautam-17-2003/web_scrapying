Demonstration of L ysimeter
Welcome
participants.
This
lecture
is
on
the
demonstration
of
Lysimeter .
Lysimeter ,
in
theory
class,
we
have
discussed
different
types
of
Lysimeters,
and
drainage
type
of
Lysimeter
will
be
demonstrated
in
the
field.
You
will
also
see
in
the
field
weighing
and
non-weighing
type
of
Lysimeter .
So,
types
of
Lysimeter
for
determining
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
We
will
show
you
the
runof f
monitoring
system
from
the
horticultural
field,
plantation
crop.
You
will
also
be
shown
a
groundwater
level
measuring
system.
Now ,
all
these
parameters
are
important
for
water
management
studies,
irrigation
studies,
or
water
balance
studies.
So,
let
us
go
to
the
field
and
try
to
learn
these
two
types
of
Lysimeter
one
is
weighing
type
Lysimeter
and
non-weighing
type
Lysimeter in the field.
In
theory
class,
we
have
explained
about
Lysimeters.
Lysimeter
is
the
device
that
is
used
to
measure
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
We
have
learned
in
the
theory
class
there
are
two
types
of
Lysimeter ,
one
is
a
weighing
type
of
Lysimeter
another
one
is
a
non-weighing
type
Lysimeter .
In
weighing
type
Lysimeter
the
entire
soil
sample
on
which
the
crop
is
grown
or
plant
is
grown
is
kept
on
a
floating
material
that
is,
it
could
be
water ,
it
could
be
heavy metal.
So,
any
deflection
due
to
a
change
in
soil
moisture
content,
due
to
precipitation,
due
to
irrigation
that
is
reflecting
in
the
change
in
the
value
of
displacement
of
the
liquid.
So,
here
in
this
particular
class,
I
am
explaining
to
you
a
laboratory
model
where
one
can
find
out
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
This
is
a
rose
plant
that
is
grown
in
an
earthen
pot,
an earthen pot is filled with the soil and then this rose plant is grown.Now ,
this
is
placed
over
a
base
and
below
the
base,
there
is
a
rubber
seal.
The
rubber
seal
which
is
coiled
looks
the
same
as
the
scooter
tire.
Now ,
when
we
are
filling
water ,
it
increases,
it
flattens,
it
goes
up
water
level
because
of
the
water
level.
So,
it
expands
and
the
connection
is
made
in
such
a
way
the
water
from
the
outlet
is
connected
with
a
measuring
scale.
Now ,
this
measuring scale it can be made vertical.
But
this
scale
is
made
on
an
inclined
manometer
tube.
The
inclination
is
provided
to
get
more
sensitiveness
and
they
increase
in
the
length
of
the
expansion.
Now
one
of
the
most
important
parts
is
that
this
base
should
be
perfectly
level.
So,
by
using
the
spirit
level
we
are
placing
here
and
we
see
that
the
water
bubble
is
exactly
at
the
center .
It
means
this
particular
base
is
perfectly
level.
Now ,
what
I
want
to
show
you
here
suppose,
I
am
growing
a
plant
and
in
this
plant,
we
are
giving
water .
Now
water
can
be
given
by
using
a
cylinder .
Now
if
we
are
giving
extra
water ,
part
of
this
water
will
go
out,
but
it
is
perfectly
made
in
such
a
way
we
will
not
give
extra
water .
And
also,
we
do
not
allow
the
water
to
go
beyond
the
root
zone
depth.
So,
any
amount
of
water
that
is
being
added
to
this
particular
pot
will
be
remains
in
the
soil
that
will
cause
an
increase
in
the
moisture content level.
And
this
moisture
content
that
is
taking
place
will
be
used
by
the
plant
for
meeting
its
evapotranspiration
requirement.
Now
when
we
are
adding
water
means
the
soil
is
gaining.
Now ,
this
gain
is
you
know
reflected
in
the
change
in
the
water
level
in
the
inclined
manometer .
Right
now,
if
I
see
I
have
not
added
water ,
at
the
particular
level
this
is
a
40
millimeter .
At
this
particular point at 40 millimeters, when this particular plane is made inclined at 15 degrees.
Now ,
here
there
is
a
provision
if
you
want
to
increase
the
sensitivity ,
we
can
further
bring
it
down
if
you
want
to
increase
you
know
means
from
5
degrees
to
30
degrees,
there
is
a
provision
we
can
change
the
angle.
And
at
this
particular
point,
I
am
taking
observation
at
a
15-degreeangle.
Now ,
let
us
see
that
I
want
to
add
water .
Now
add
water
means
just
in
place
of
water
what
I am doing, I am putting 200-gram weight.
Now
by
placing
200-gram
weight
there
is
a
change
in
the
water
level.
So,
initially
water
level
let
me
just
see
the
initial
water
level
it
is
about
45
millimeters.
Now
when
I
am
placing
200
grams
means
a
certain
amount
of
water
which
is
equivalent
to
200
gram.
Let
us
say
it
is
added
to
the
plant
there
is
a
change
in
the
water
level
and
that
change
in
the
water
level
is
reflected
as
65
millimeters.
Now ,
let
us
say
that
plant
needs
to
more
water .
So,
I
am
adding
another
200
grams.
So,
by
addition
of
another
200
grams,
the
change
in
the
water
level
means
there
is
an
increase
in
the
water
level
which
is
nothing
but
an
increase
in
this
soil
moisture
content
I
can
say
because
I
am
just
putting
these
weights
in
terms
of
analogy ,
I
am
putting
in
terms
of
adding
water
into
the
soil
sample.
Now ,
once
I
am
adding
water
to
the
soil
sample,
now
this
value
has
increased
the
moisture
content
to
90
millimeters.
Now
further
if
I
am
putting
another
200
gram
means
further
I
am
adding
water
so
it
has
become
from
95
millimeters
to
115
millimeters.
So,
20
millimeters
is
the
change
in
the
water
level
which
is
reflecting
here.
Now ,
let
us
say
this
much
amount
of
water
that
is
equivalent
to
600
grams
of
water
has
been
added
to
the
soil.
Now ,
the
plant
will
be
using
this
water for meeting the evapotranspiration requirement of the crop.
What
I
am
telling
here,
I
am
just
putting
one
thing
I
am
not
giving
any
additional
water
which
is
going
as
surface
runof f,
I
am
not
allowing
water
to
go
beyond
the
root
zone
depth.
So,
water
remains
in
the
form
of
soil
water
content.
So,
now
I
am
just
seeing
means
after
24
hours,
let
us
say
next
day
I
am
coming
and
then
I
am
observing
whether
the
how
much
amount
of
water
it
had
been withdrawn by the plant.So,
I
am
taking
out
water
let
us
say
200
grams
of
water
is
taken
out.
So,
200
grams
of
water
is
taken
out
the
value
it
has
changed,
it
has
come
to
97
millimeters.
So,
97
millimeters
means
whatever
the
value
it
was
there,
it
was
there
initially
let
me
tell
you,
it
was
there
initially
about
120.
Now
it
is
123
millimeter
and
when
I
am
taking
out
200
means
next
day
when
I
come
here
and I take observation I find that here now this reading is 97 millimeter .
So,
from
120
to
97
millimeters,
this
much
amount
of
water
is
lost
due
to
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop
because
I
did
not
allow
any
water
to
go
beyond
the
root
zone,
I
did
not
allow
any
water
to
go
is
surface
runof f.
So,
this
is
the
water
that
has
been
used
by
the
plant
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration
requirement.
Now
again
I
am
taking
out
means
after
24
hours
or
means after 48 hours let us say , I am coming for observation.
And
I
observe
so
200
millimeters,
it
means
there
is
a
withdrawal
of
water
has
been
taken
by
the
plant
and
then
I
find
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
value.
Now ,
this
difference
in
the
value
is
I
find
here
is
73
millimeters.
So,
from
97
millimeters
to
73
millimeters
it
has
come.
So,
this
is
the
equivalent
amount
of
water
that
has
been
consumed
by
the
plant
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration requirement.
So,
like
this,
this
particular
gadget
first
needs
to
be
calibrated
that
at
what
will
be
the
range
say
in
a
particular
angle
right
now
I
am
putting
about
15-degree
angle.
So,
what
is
the
range
that
water
level
will
fluctuate
and
then
this
has
to
be
calibrated
then
the
second
part
is
we
can
keep
giving
water
and
then
we
can
find
out
how
much
amount
of
the
water
once
we
are
putting
water
with
the
help
of
now,
I
will
show
you
say
this
is
another
200
gram
I
am
taking
out
and
then
observation is 52 millimeter .
Now
I
will
put
water
and
just
it
will
show
you
that
here
I
am
putting
water
say,
this
is
right
now
it
is
you
can
see
it
is
a
1500
ml
and
putting
just
simply
water
1400
ml
means
100
ml
of
water
I
am
adding.
Right
now,
observation
is
this
is
50
millimeters,
water
level
in
the
inclinedmanometer
is
50
millimeters
at
a
15-degree
inclination.
I
am
adding
100
ml
of
water .
Sorry ,
it
has already gone more than 100 ml, so I am putting let us say another .
This
is
approximately
let
us
say
about
this
is
1200,
about
1300.
So,
200
ml
of
water
I
have
added
and
the
reading
was
50
millimeters.
At
present
this
reading
has
come
to
80
millimeters.
So,
80
millimeters
is
the
water
level
in
the
manometer ,
and
the
next
day
when
I
come
and
take
an
observation,
I
will
take
out
this
particular
and
again
I
will
put
it.
So,
I
will
take
observation
and
then I will see how much amount of water is lost.
So,
it
will
be
the
combined
evaporation
and
transpiration
it
has
taken
place
from
the
soil
because
you
can
see
here
no
water
is
taken,
it
has
gone
beyond
the
pot
and
it
has
not
been
spelled
out.
So,
this
200
ml
of
water
which
had
been
added
here
that
can
be
seen
that
how
much
water
it
will
be
lost.
So,
that
water
will
be
consumed
by
the
plant.
This
way
one
can
find
out
what
is
the
total
water
requirement
for
the
entire
season.
If
it
is
a
long-duration
crop,
according
to
the
size
of
the
container , according to the depth of the container , the volume of the container can be decided.
We
have
fabricated
three
Lysimeters
where
crops
can
be
grown
inside
the
Lysimeter .
We
discussed
the
weighing
type
of
Lysimeter
where
the
entire
part
was
floating
above
a
rubber
gasket.
In
this
case,
these
Lysimeters
are
the
non-weighing
type
of
Lysimeters
where
different
components of water movement take place that can be monitored.
So,
this
particular
Lysimeter
is
one
meter
long,
one
meter
wide,
and
one
meter
deep.
It
is
driven
into
the
soil
and
then
the
soil
from
the
field
is
filled
in.
We
have
tried
in
these
Lysimeters
to
maintain
the
same
soil
texture,
same
bulk
density ,
and
same
compaction.
So,
over
the
years,
when
we
have
conducted
an
experiment,
we
find
we
can
replicate
or
create
conditions
whatever
the field condition exists in the adjoining area.
So,
the
same
crop
is
being
taken,
we
have
taken
in
our
experiment
okra
crop,
we
have
grown
moong
crop,
we
have
grown
rice
crop
in
the
same
thing
to
find
out
crop
coefficient
as
well
asevapotranspiration
requirements
of
the
crop.
Now ,
these
three
Lysimeters
are
where
we
are
collecting
data.
So,
in
one
case,
in
this
particular
setup
what
we
see
is
that
here
its
bottom
is
kept
open.
So,
in
this
one
as
well
as
in
this
particular
Lysimeter
the
bottom
is
again
it
is
kept
open
and
in this particular L ysimeter , the bottom is kept closed.
So,
this
Lysimeter
when
we
are
giving
water
so,
water
is
being
given
with
the
help
of
the
micro
irrigation
system
so
a
measured
quantity
of
water
is
being
supplied
in
the
Lysimeter .
In
all
these
three
cases
same.
Since
the
bottom
is
kept
open
so,
evaporation
means
without
a
crop,
the
crop
is
not
being
taken.
So,
evaporation
and
then
the
water
which
goes
beyond
the
root
zone
depth
or
90
centimeters of the L ysimeter , is taking place from the L ysimeter .
Similarly ,
evaporation
plus
percolation,
these
two
components
are
taking
place
in
this
Lysimeter
whereas,
in
this
particular
Lysimeter
we
are
growing
crop.
So,
and
then
the
amount
of
water
which
we
have
given
their
same
amount
of
water
is
given
in
this
Lysimeter .
So,
what
happened?
The
bottom
is
kept
open
so,
evaporation
because
plan
or
crop
is
being
grown
so,
transpiration
takes
place
and
then
also
deep
percolation
means
water
which
goes
beyond
the
depth
of
Lysimeter beyond the root zone of the crop that is you know is considered.
So,
evaporation
plus
transpiration
plus
deep
percolation
all
three
components
takes
place
in
this
one.
Whereas,
in
this
particular
Lysimeter
the
bottom
is
kept
closed.
So,
the
bottom
is
kept
closed,
it
is
only,
and
then
no
crop
is
being
taken.
So,
the
amount
of
water
which
we
are
adding
in
the
left
or
the
middle
one
means
the
first
one
or
in
the
middle
second
Lysimeter
here,
the
same
amount
of
water
is
being
given
but
it
is
kept
since
the
bottom
is
kept
you
know
closed
so,
water
remains in the L ysimeter .
So,
it
is
only
evaporation
that
will
take
place.
So,
if
you
want
to
subtract
the
total
component
means
evaporation
plus
transpiration
plus
the
deep
percolation
loss
then
I
can
subtract
the
evaporation
which
has
taken
plus
from
this
Lysimeter
then
I
can
know
what
is
the
evaporation?what
is
transpiration
plus
deep
percolation,
there
is
also
transpiration
plus
deep
percolation.
So,
these components individually can be counted and measured.
Now ,
in
Lysimeters
we
have
placed
soil
moisture
measuring
instruments.
So,
there
are
two
types
of
soil
moisture
measuring
instruments
where
we
are
using
FDR
that
is
known
as
a
frequency
domain
reflectometer .
So,
here
this
white,
this
particular
pipeline
which
you
see
here.
This
is
an
access
tube
and
the
access
tube
is
driven
up
to
the
Lysimeter
even
beyond
the
Lysimeter .
This
is
driven up to 1.2 centimeters.
So,
what
happened?
In
this
case,
when
we
are
giving
putting
the
placing
the
Lysimeter
here,
you
see
there
are
these
two
electrical
probes
and
the
arrangement
made
this
particular ,
it
is
10
centimeter .
So,
the
electrical
field
means
when
we
are
giving
a
high-frequency
current
when
it
is
passed
through.
It
generates
the
electrical
field
and
this
high
frequency
the
current
which
is
passed, it is a function of the dielectric properties of the soil.
So,
a
dielectric
constant
of
water
is
80
and
when
it
is
dry
soil
it
is
approximately
0
to
4.
But
at
the
moisture
content
of
this
soil,
it
is
more
getting
influenced.
So,
though
the
waveguide
it
gets
influenced
by
the
availability
of
the
moisture
content
in
the
soil.
So,
here
it
is
you
know
10
centimeters
as
it
is
being
shown.
So,
you
can
see
here,
these
observations
are
this
is
first
10
centimeters then we can take another 10 centimeters.
So,
the
moisture
content
in
the
soil
at
a
different
depth
can
be
monitored.
Now ,
since
already
this
tube
is
above
the
ground
about
10
centimeters
above
the
ground.
So,
when
we
will
take
observation
say
when
we
will
place
20
ccm
the
observation
what
we
will
get,
this
observation
will
give
volumetric
moisture
content
at
10
cm
depth.
So,
here
I
am
placing.
So,
this
is
the
value
is 13.2 mm per 10 cm.Now ,
I
can
place
that
say
I
am
putting
it
is
a
30
centimeter .
So,
when
it
is
30
centimeters
the
value
is
21.1
millimeters
per
10
centimeters.
So,
the
water
content
it
is
being
you
know ,
it
is
coming
in
a
linear
unit,
but
this
can
be
expressed
in
the
volumetric
unit,
also
in
percentage,
it
can
be
expressed.
So,
this
is
the
one
way
of
finding
out
the
moisture
content
at
different
depths
in
the
soil.
And
so,
the
amount
of
water
that
is
stored
in
the
root
zone
depth
can
be
measured
by
using
a
field
frequency
domain
reflectometer .
There
is
several
devices
time-domain
reflectometer .
Several
other
sensors
are
available
to
monitor
the
soil
moisture
content.
Now
when
we
are
talking
about
when
I
was
taking
your
class,
so,
in
the
theory
class,
I
was
told
various
components
take place.
One
is
how
much
amount
of
water
is
added
in
the
form
of
irrigation.
So,
the
depth
of
water
which
is
supplied
to
the
Lysimeters
for
meeting
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
that
can
be
you
know
a
measured
amount
it
is
being
given.
So,
this
we
are
it
can
be
given
or
in
the
form
of
rainfall,
if
something
it
is
coming
that
can
be
added.
So,
that
is
the
gain,
amount
of
water
and
then water which is going as evaporation, loss as evaporation.
This
we
are
taking
the
balance
in
the
values
in
three
as
I
told
you
and
then
the
amount
of
water
that
is
going
beyond
the
root
zone
depth.
So,
one
has
to
monitor
the
water
level
also
if
it
is
going
to
the
water
table
level
then
that
can
be
measured
by
what
means
measuring
the
water
table
or
the
amount
of
water
which
is
you
know
at
different
depths,
that
the
soil
moisture
content
that
can
be measured.
The
other
way
of
measurement
of
soil
moisture
content
is
by
using
a
tensiometer ,
which
is
by
a
tensiometer .
So,
a
tensiometer
is
a
device
that
measures
the
tenacity
of
the
soil
which
is
the
water
that
is
held
by
the
soil
particles.
So,
these
tensiometers
are
available
in
you
know
different
sizes.
You
can
see
here
we
have
inserted
one
tensiometer ,
this
is
placed
about
15
centimeters
below
the
soil level.And
this
is
another
suppose
we
were
interested
to
find
out
the
moisture
content
and
this
is
at
the
deeper
depth.
So,
a
tensiometer
is
a
tube
that
is
filled
with
water .
The
other
end
of
the
tensiometer ,
a
common
tensiometer
that
is
connected
with
a
gauge
that
carries
a
vacuum
gauge
which
is
giving
the
negative
pressure
or
tension
or
suction
we
say.
Now
in
this
particular
tensiometer , we have placed a very special type of rubber membrane.
This
is
specifically
made
rubber
membrane
and
when
we
are
piercing
in
a
needle,
it
gives
the
how
much
amount
of
that
tension
it
is
available.
So,
when
we
want
to
find
out
soil
moisture
tension
at
different
depths,
we
place
a
tensiometer
in
the
soil
at
different
depths
and
then
find
out
how
much
is
the
soil
moisture
tension
at
different
depths.
Now ,
this
soil
moisture
tension
is
calibrated in terms of moisture content.
So,
there
is
a
calibration
curve
that
is
used
when
we
are
taking
data.
So,
there
is
a
lot
of
you
know
the
development
it
has
taken
place
with
the
time.
So,
here
these
are
also
connected
with
some
digital
or
pressure
transducer -based.
In
this
one
also,
I
will
demonstrate
to
you
there
is
a
needle
when
we
are
placing
the
needle
in
the
tensiometer ,
it
gives
the
observation.
It
is
giving
14
millibars,
14
millibar
is
the
observation
which
we
are
getting
the
value
of
this
tension
which
has
been created.
Now ,
14
millibar
is
equivalent
to
how
much
is
the
soil
moisture
tension,
this
has
to
be
calibrated.
Means
at
that
particular
depth,
as
I
told
you
that
it
is
placed
at
15-centimeter
depth
so,
a
soil
sample
is
to
be
taken.
Now
that
the
soil
sample
is
to
find
out
the
gravimetric
moisture
content
and
then
this
calibration
curve
means
for
the
different
you
know
soil
moisture
tension
and
then
corresponding
soil
moisture
content
will
be
obtained
and
from
the
calibration
curve
one
can
find
out what is the value of soil moisture tensions.
So,
different
devices
are
available
to
monitor
soil
moisture
content.
So,
the
amount
of
water
that
is
stored
in
the
soil
as
soil
water
that
is
consumed
by
the
plant
for
evapotranspiration.
So,
waterthat
is
available
in
the
soil
can
be
measured
by
any
one
of
these
devices.
It
can
be
the
FDR,
it
can
be
TDR,
it
can
be
granular
soil
moisture
sensors,
it
can
be
there
are
various
devices.
You
have
different types of soil moisture sensors that are available.
So,
the
soil
moisture
content
in
the
soil
and
then
the
water
used
by
the
plant
by
taking
the
balance
of
soil
moisture
content,
taking
the
balance
of
evaporation
component,
taking
the
balance
or
the
deep
percolation
content,
one
can
find
out
what
is
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
Now ,
in-field
water
balance
when
we
are
doing,
we
are
measuring
various components. These components when I was telling you when the rainfall occurs.
Some
part
of
the
rain
will
be
absorbed
by
the
soil
through
the
infiltration
process,
some
part
of
this
water
will
be
absorbed
by
the
soil
as
the
soil
water
which
will
be
available
or
the
plant
for
meeting
its
evapotranspiration
required.
Some
part
of
the
water
will
go
as
a
deep
percolation.
Now
when
the
intensity
of
the
rainfall
is
more
than
the
infiltration
capacity
of
the
soil
this
water
will go as runof f.
So,
let
us
see
how
the
runof f
monitoring
is
done
which
we
have
set
up
here
where
we
are
monitoring
other
components
of
the
hydrologic
cycle,
other
components
of
field
water
balance
that is used for the determination of evapotranspiration.
In
field
water
balance
studies
to
determine
various
components
of
water
balance
say
input
component
as
irrigation
or
precipitation
as
runof f.
When
it
falls
on
the
ground,
some
part
of
the
water it is appearing as surface runof f.
So,
say
this
is
my
horticulture
plantation.
Now
during
the
rainy
season
besides
water ,
it
goes
through
an
infiltration
process,
it
is
intercepted
by
the
plant
canopy
it
is
appearing
part
of
the
water
it
is
appearing
as
surface
runof f.
That
surface
runof f
is
measured
by
using
the
appropriate
device.
So,
here
is
what
we
see
from
this
horticultural
plantation
area
of
sapota
crop
as
well
as
for the Litchi plantation.This
is
about
half-hectare
land
in
which
these
plantations
have
been
made
and
in
this
half-hectare
land,
we
are
providing
irrigation
water
through
a
drip
irrigation
system.
But
during
the
rainy
season
irrigation
is
not
given,
but
we
want
to
know
what
are
the
different
components,
which
are
playing,
which
takes
place
from
these
horticultural
plants.
So,
the
runof f
part
is
what
we
see
when it comes to this area. We see here, there are three outlets.
So,
water
from
the
middle
outlet
is
being
collected
in
a
collection
tank
and
water
from
the
adjoining
other
two
outlets
from
this
area
goes
to
the
outside.
And
that
is
the
outside
channel
it
goes.
So,
when
it
comes
to
the
middle
pipeline,
it
goes
to
the
collection
tank.
It
is
measured
with
the
help
of
a
digital
water
level
recorder .
So,
digital
water
level
recorder ,
as
its
name
is
said
that
it has one end, you can say this is a counterweight and this other end is float.
So,
as
the
water
in
the
tank
will
enter ,
it
will
cause
a
rise
in
the
water
level,
and
this
rise
in
the
water
level
will
cause
the
float
to
come
up,
and
then
the
counterweight
will
go
down.
So,
this
rise
is
measured
in
terms
of
whatever
the
runof f
it
has
generated
from
this
horticultural
plantation,
and
this
data
are
in
a
digital
form.
So,
this
is
what
I
was
telling
you,
this
is
a
pulley
and
in
this
pulley ,
one
end
is
a
counterweight,
another
end
is
float
and
then
this
is
driven
and
then here there is a battery and then data which are coming over here.
And
these
data
there
is
a
provision
that
one
can
download
the
data
in
a
USB
port
and
that
can
be
analyzed.
So,
we
have
collected
these
data
for
more
than
five
years
period
and
then
these
data
are
you
know
used
to
compute
how
much
amount
of
water
it
has
gone
in
different
processes
of
a
hydrological
cycle
or
irrigation
water
balance
components.
So,
infiltration,
deep
percolation
we
are
monitoring
the
water
level,
groundwater
level,
amount
of
water
that
is
appearing
as
surface
runof f.
So,
all
these
components
are
there
and
then
they
can
be
accounted
for
in
terms
of
the
evapotranspiration requirement of the crop.Runof f
is
influenced
by
several
factors.
One
of
the
factors
is
vegetation
cover .
We
have
seen
the
horticulture
plantation
where
Sapota
and
Litchi,
was
existing,
and
then
runof f
water
was
being
monitored
for
that
type
of
vegetation.
When
the
agricultural
crop
is
there
where
you
will
see
it
is
a
small
height,
short
height
crop
which
is
covering
the
ground
surface.
It
also
influences
the
infiltration characteristics of this soil; it also influences the physical characteristics of the soil.
So,
runof f
is
also
being
monitored
from
agricultural
crop
fields
where
we
are
cultivating
in
this
field
rice,
moong.
We
also
cultivated
vegetable
crop
such
as
okra
and
then
just
a
few
weeks
back
we
harvested
broccoli
crop.
Now ,
water
whenever
rainfall
occurs
when
excess
rainfall
occurs
generates
the
runof f.
So,
runof f
is
being
monitored
from
such
a
plot
and
that
is
in
the
same
manner
which
I
explained
in
this
one
that
water .
There
are
three
outlets
there
is
one
outlet
exist
here.
There
is
another
pipeline
that
is
in
the
middle
and
then
the
other
one.
So,
out
of
the
total
runof f,
it
is
generated,
it
gets
distributed
to
three
outlets.
So,
two
outlets
go
meet
with
the
channel
that
is
the
outlet
channel
and
then
from
the
middle
that
is
the
center
pipeline,
it
is
connected
to
the
water
collection
tank.
Now
water
collection
tank
again
it
is
you
know
means
the
digital
water
level recorder .
And
this
digital
water
recorder ,
it
is
the
rise
in
the
water
level
is
monitored
by
you
know ,
when
there
is
a
change
in
the
water
level
so,
the
float
rises
and
this
means
that
the
rise
in
the
float
level
is
monitored
in
terms
of
digital
value.
The
solar
panel
connected
to
each
of
these
water
level
recorders provides the power source to operate the water level recorder .
Another
important
component
of
water
balance
is
deep
percolation.
So,
water
that
goes
below
the root zone depth and that water if it meets with the water table.
This
causes
a
rise
in
the
water
level.
So,
we
discussed
the
measurements
of
runof f
from
different
types
of
covers.
Here,
we
also
monitored
runof f
from
the
cashew
plantation.
So,
we
have
arunof f
monitoring
gadget.
Here
is
another
component
of
monitoring
of
groundwater
level.
So,
these
groundwater
levels
are
being
monitored
daily
that
how
much
amount
of
water
is
being
used
by the plant through the root system by capillary action in adjacent to this, there is a tube well.
This
tube
well
the
when
it
is
being
operated
this,
we
want
to
also
know
how
much
amount
of
water
it
is
getting
affected,
the
water
level
is
getting
affected
because
of
the
operation
of
tube
well
in
the
far
that
is
being
used
for
irrigation
purpose
in
our
agricultural
engineering
department
experimental
form.
We
do
monitor
and
we
want
to
know
that
how
much
water
has
gone
in
the
groundwater when we are rechar ging.
So,
in
this
particular
area,
we
have
made
a
trench
and
this
trench
is
basically
meant
for
the
water
whatever
is
going
in
the
trench
as
surface
runof f.
So,
this
gets
deposited
in
the
trench
and
that
causes
a
rise
in
the
water
level.
Now
I
will
demonstrate
to
you
when
we
are
measuring
the
water
level
how
water
level
from
a
piezometer .
So,
this
is
one
piezometer
which
has
been
installed
like
this,
you
know
adjacent
to
this
there
is
another
piezometer
and
those
are
small
other
pipelines
that are kept at the shallow level and these are quite deep.
So,
on
a
deeper
level,
these
piezometers
have
been
installed
and
I
will
show
you
what
is
the
current
water
level
in
the
piezometer .
So,
the
observation
is
6.3
meters.
So,
6.3
meters
is
equivalent
to
about
20.6
feet.
So,
the
water
level
at
present
in
my
experimental
area
which
is
the
Kaaju
plantation
that
is
a
cashew
plantation
area
where
we
have
observed
that
it
is
20.6
feet.
So,
these
data
mean
runof f
data,
the
groundwater
level
data,
soil
moisture
data,
evaporation
data,
transpiration data are used to compute evapotranspiration loss.
So,
in
this
particular
field
demonstration,
we
have
learned
two
types
of
Lysimeter ,
weighing
type
of
Lysimeter
and
non-weighing
type
of
Lysimeter .
Non-weighing
type
of
Lysimeter
which
we
installed;
we
have
used
for
a
variety
of
crops
to
determine
its
crop
coefficient.
We
have
published
papers
for
a
non-weighing
type
of
Lysimeter .
We
have
monitored
runof f
that
also
was
shown
to
you
digital
water
level
recorder
where
runof f
generated
from
horticultural
plantationcrop where Sapota, Litchi, and other crops also.
So,
a
similar
gadget
is
used
for
monitoring
the
runof f
which
is
taking
place
from
any
micro
watersheds.
And
then
groundwater
level
measurement
whatever
the
water
table
rise
is
depletion
in
the
water
table
it
takes
place
that
also
we
demonstrated
you.
Now
in
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we will have a tutorial class on evapotranspiration requirements and crop water requirements.
So, thank you very much for your patience in hearing.
