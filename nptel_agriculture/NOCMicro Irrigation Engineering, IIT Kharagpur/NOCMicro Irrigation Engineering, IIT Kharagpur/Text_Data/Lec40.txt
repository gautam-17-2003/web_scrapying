Sprinkler  Irrigation System
Hello
participants.
I
am
starting
a
new
lecture
on
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
This
is
one
of
the
important
lecture
under
the
pressurized
irrigation
category .
We,
in
the
previous
lectures,
discussed
about
micro
irrigation
emission
devices.
Those
emission
devices
operate
at
low
pressure,
whereas,
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system
requires
a
relatively
large
pressure
and
this
is
used
for
crops
which
are
of
higher
height,
maybe
sugarcane,
some
plantation
crops
of
very
greater
height
water
can
be
applied
by
using
such system.
Now
in
this
particular
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
we
will
discuss
about
its
importance,
its
limitations.
We
will
discuss
about
what
are
the
different
types
of
sprinkler irrigation system and its components.
So
when
we
talk
of
what
is
sprinkler
irrigation.
Sprinkler
irrigation
belongs
to
the
family
of
pressurized
irrigation
where
water
is
being
applied
by
using
pressure
and
then
water
dischar ged
through
the
nozzle
in
the
form
of
a
jet
which
breakdowns
into
the
droplets,
is
shot
into
the
air,
and
falls
on
the
ground
or
the
plant
foliage.
It
follows
a circular pattern around the sprinkler head.
Sprinklers
have
hammer
device.
If
you
look
at
this
one
here
there
is
a
hammering
device
it
is
there.
And
then
it
is
a
slow
rotating
or
revolving
mechanism.
There
is
a
hammer
wedge
or
spring.
This
is
the
spring-loaded
arm
where
the
rocker
weight
which tries to balance the pressure which is coming due to water .
And
so
at
the
nozzle
the
water
which
is
coming
with
the
pressure,
that
pressure
head
is
converted
to
the
velocity
head.
And
then
such
type
of
sprinkler
systems
these
areused
for
high-density
plantation
and
this
has
another
added
advantage
that
it
creates
the microclimate near the vicinity of the plant.
These
are
the
set
of
advantages.
It
has
water -saving.
It
increases
the
yield.
There
are
the
system
can
be
taken
from
one
place
to
other
places.
It
may
be
used
for
undulating
land.
It
saves
land
as
no
bounds,
ridges,
furrows,
etc.,
these
are
required.
So
whole
area
it
can
be
brought
under
cultivation.
It
influences
the
microclimate
because
the
water which comes it comes like rainfall.
So
those
water
droplets
it
forms
the
water
vapor .
So
mainly
during
the
summer
month,
it
creates
a
cooler
environment,
and
particularly
during
a
frost
period
sprinklers
protect
crops
against
the
frost.
It
suits
all
types
of
topography
except
for
the
fine-textured
soil.
Suits
to
almost
all
types
of
crops.
Ideal
for
germination
of
seeds
and
establishing seedlings.
There
are
some
limitations
that
it
is
when
it
is
being
used
in
a
ripened
fruit.
So
the
impact
of
the
water
rate
may
spoil
the
fruit.
It
can
be
not
suitable
for
large
trees.
Because
of
the
water
which
is
coming
to
these
trees
they
interfere
with
the
operations.
The
jet
gets
interrupted.
And
then
power
requirement
is
relatively
high
and
mainly
particularly for the jet nozzle type of sprinklers.
Not
suitable
for
heavy
clay
soil
which
has
got
low
infiltration
rate
one
has
to
adjust
the
application
rate
so
that
such
type
of
soil,
the
plants
or
crop
grown
in
such
type
of
soil
which
are
not
the
high,
the
very
heavy
clay
or
fine
texture
that
can
be
used.
Evaporation
and
wind
drifts
are
very
high
when
it
is
applied
at
a
very
low
rate.
High
initial
investment
is
involved.
And
water
must
be
free
from
all
the
debris,
sand,
all
dissolved salts because it may hamper the working.
Now
there
are
different
types
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
Classification
is
made
on
the
basis
of
the
spray
pattern.
It
could
be
on
the
basis
of
the
rotating
head
kind
of
a
thing.
The
other
classification
has
been
made
based
on
the
portability ,
based
on
themovement.
So
these
could
be
portable,
semi-portable,
semi-permanent,
permanent,
set
move, solid set, or continuous move.
And
these
can
be
further
on
how
the
movement
can
be
made.
Whether
it
can
be
done
by
manually
or
it
can
be
done
by
using
the
mechanically
driven
system
or
it
can
be
a
continuous
moving
system
or
central
pivot
system,
it
can
be
such
type
of
system
means
your
linear
move,
traveler
move,
or
central
pivot
that
is
circle
kind
of
a
thing
the moment is done.
You
can
see
here
the
perforated
pipes.
The
water
is
emitting
out
of
the
perforated
pipes.
So
it
means
the
perforated
pipe
system
is
one
of
the
system
it
requires
low
pressure.
Normally ,
such
perforated
pipes
where
the
holes
are
made,
it
operates,
at
low
pressure.
The
application
rate
for
such
type
of
pipe
system
is
between
1.25
and
5
cm
per
hour.
It
has
got
some
certain
limitations
that
it
requires
low
pressure
means
it
is
working
at
low
pressure.
When
the
pressure
is
high
this
particular
type
of
system
may
not
work.
Release
more
water
per
unit
area,
this
is
one
disadvantage
of
the
system. And then it is unsuitable for soils which are of very low infiltration capacity .
A
rotating
head
system,
you
can
see
here
this
is
a
device
which
has
got
a
single
nozzle.
And
then
when
the
water
it
comes
so
there
is
a
sprinkler
head.
So
in
this
type
of
system,
small
spring
size
nozzles
are
placed
on
the
riser
pipe.
So
this
particular
unit
is
connected
with
the
riser
pipe.
And
then
the
common
device
to
rotate
the
sprinkler
nozzle is a hammer .
So
here
when
it
strikes,
it
strikes
the
jet
emer ging
out
of
this.
So
there
is
this
particular
swing
arm
or
jet
that
will
hit
on
this
arm.
So
what
will
happen,
it
will
deflect
and
then
again
because
of
the
weight
here,
so
it
will
bring
it
back.
So
there
is
a
small
hammer
activated by the thrust of water striking against when connected to it.
It
could
be
two
nozzles.
Of
course
this
particular
device
here
right
now
you
have
seen
it
is
a
single
nozzle.
There
could
be
two
nozzles.
One
is
the
ring
nozzle.
Another
one
is
the
spreader
nozzle.
And
then
the
sprinkler
head
is
mounted
on
the
riser
which
isabove
the
crop
height
and
rotated
through
90
to
360
degree
to
irrigate
a
rectangular
strip.
The
pressure
requirement
is
2
to
4
kg
per
square
centimeter
and
it
has
got
a
different
application
rate.
And
these
application
rates
are
decided
on
the
basis
of
a
particular
type of soil and also on the slope of the land.
Now
coming
to
the
classification
based
on
the
portability
point
of
view ,
the
system
can
be
portable
as
name
it
is
given
portable.
So
all
the
components
mean
distribution
component,
the
mainline,
sub-mainline,
laterals,
and
then
entire
pumping
unit
this
is
portable.
Then
semi-portable.
In
the
case
of
semi-portable,
the
source
of
water
and
pumping
plant
is
fixed
and
the
rest
of
the
components
are
movable.
So
you
can
see
here
this
is
the
main
pipeline.
There
is
a
stationary
power
source
of
water
where
the
pump
is
fixed.
And
then
these
laterals
are
moving
from
one
place
to
other
places.
So
all
the
entire unit is portable.
Permanent
as
the
name
says
this
is
a
permanent
system
means
main
lines,
sub
mainline,
lateral,
and
with
stationary
pumping
plant
and
water
source.
All
the
components
of
this
type
of
system
are
permanently
installed.
And
then
it
is
installed
mainly
for
such
crops
which
are
perennial
in
nature
or
for
the
entire
season
this
is
made.
Semi-permanent
it
has
a
portable
lateral
line,
permanent
mainline,
sub-mains,
and
stationary water source with the pumping unit.
Set-move
system
or
portable
irrigation
system.
Set-move
system
as
the
name
says,
the
movable
from
one
set
of
irrigations.
Once
the
particular
irrigation
it
is
done
then
it
is
taken
place
to
the
other
place,
another
set
place
it
will
go.
It
can
be
done
manually
or
by using a mechanical way or by using a tractor .So
this
could
be
set-move
remain
stationary
when
water
is
when
this,
particularly
when
the
irrigation
is
being
given.
So
for
a
given
time
of
irrigation,
it
will
remain
constant
over
there.
Then
it
can
be
moved
from
one
position
to
other
position.
And
then
there
is
a
single
mainline
through
the
center
of
the
field
and
one
or
more
lateral
on
each
side
of
the
main
these
are
attached.
This
set-move
system
can
be
hand-move
or
it
can
be
tow-move
or
it
can
be
side-roll
or
gun-type.
So
there
could
be
different
types of movement it can be made.
So
another
kind
of
system
which
you
see
here
is
a
solid
set
system.
So
as
the
name
says
that
is
a
solid
set.
This
type
of
system
has
got
enough
laterals
which
can
be
operated
at
one
time
simultaneously ,
particularly
when
say
frost
control
when
it
occurs
or
snowfall
it
occurs
to
protect
the
crop
due
to
injury
due
to
snow
particularly
in apple irrigation.
So
all
the
plants
will
need
irrigation
at
the
same
time,
then,
in
that
case,
such
type
of
irrigation
system
is
very
much
required.
So
this
is
the
solid
set
system.
It
is
installed
for
the
entire
crop
season
or
it
can
be
permanently
installed.
So
particularly
this
is
beneficial
to
crops
which
need
frequent
irrigation
in
small
depth.
Such
systems
can
be
coupled
with
automation
as
and
when
depending
on
the
requirement,
depending
on
the temperature all that thing it can be automated.
Continuous
move
system.
Here
what
you
see,
this
is
the
center
pivot
system.
It
has
got
laterals
and
the
sprinkler
remains
connected
to
the
main
and
it
moves
continuously
as
the
water
is
being
sprayed.
So
this
could
be
the
center
pivot
system,
traveler
system,
or linear move system. So a continuous move system can be of three types.
So
here
what
you
see
this
is
a
center
pivot
system.
You
can
see
here
how
circular
irrigation
is
being
given.
Only
the
problem
with
the
center
pivot
system
if
the
field
is
rectangular
in
shape,
then
the
corners
are
not
irrigated.
So
the
center
pivot
system
consists
of
a
pipeline
rotating
around
the
pivot
and
supported
by
self-propelled
towers
at
a
height
of
2
to
4
m
and
25
to
75
meter
is
the
spacing
between
them.
The
radial
lines
rotate
slowly
around
the
center
pivot
by
water
pressure.
Electric
motor
or
oilhydraulic
motors.
This
means
there
could
be
different
ways
of
movement.
The
towers
are supported by wheels or skids.
A
part
of
the
circle
sprinkler
end
gun
is
provided
at
the
end
here
because
in
order
to
spread
the
water
to
this
end
so
that
the
corners
can
be
easily
irrigated.
Each
point
covers
the
large
circular
land
area
in
the
order
of
60
to
100
hectare
field
at
in
one
stretch
it
can
be
irrigated.
And
such
systems
are
fully
automated
for
large
farming
plants.
In
India,
we
have
the
center
pivot
system
in
National
Seeds
Corporation
and
State
Seeds
Corporation
where
such
farms
are
very
large.
As
an
individual
holding
such
type of system it needs when the area is lar ge.
Then
there
is
the
linear
move
system,
this
also
falls
under
the
continuous
move
system.
So
it
is
developed
against
the
problem
associated
with
the
center
pivot
system.
It
covers
the
corners
and
reduces
runof f.
So
this
is
the
arrangement
where
you
can
see
here
how
the
linear
moment
the
laterals
are
moving
from
one
place
to
other
place. And the average application rate is half of that of the end of the pivot.
It
has
towers
with
an
electric
motor
and
an
alignment
system.
The
lateral
moves
continuously
in
a
linear
fashion
as
the
name
says
that
is
a
linear
move.
So
the
water
is
supplied
to
the
lateral
through
a
flexible
hose
hooked
to
the
mainline
by
traveling
pumping
plant.
And
that
pumps
water
from
an
open
ditch
or
it
could
be
the
other
source
of
water .
This
can
be
powered
by
a
diesel
engine
or
electric
motor
if
the
electric supply is available.
Then
traveler
sprinkler
system.
This
is
the
other
kind.
This
is
the
source
of
water .
There
is
a
pumping
plant.
This
is
mainline
and
you
can
see
here
how
the
cable
and
hose
is
connected
and
then
how
the
systems
are
operating.
So
high
capacity
gun
type
of
sprinklers
are
mounted
on
the
cart
and
hose
that
conveyed
the
water
from
a
buried
portable mainline to the sprinkler line.The
cart
is
pulled
across
the
field
by
cable
and
supply
hose.
It
is
adaptable
to
many
field
sizes,
shapes,
and
terrains.
It
can
irrigate
in
a
rectangular
strip
up
to
900
m
strip,
wide
strip.
It
can
be
transported
from
field
to
field
at
a
very
high
speed
but
it
requires
the
crop
free
from
the
tow
path.
These
can
be
further
you
know
hard
hose,
then
the
soft hose. This could be the hose can be soft or this one.
Then
set-move
system.
It
can
be
manually
that
is
hand-move.
It
can
be
tow-move.
It
can
be
a
side-roll.
It
can
be
gun-type.
So
such
systems
these
are
hand-move
system,
these
are
manually
moved
and
where
coupling,
as
well
as
the
removal,
means
detaching it can be done manually .
Such
types
of
systems
are
made
up
of
high-density
polyethylene
pipe
and
then
these
are of the size of 50 to 100 mm in diameter , available in 6 m, 9 m long pipelines.
Tow-move
system.
Each
lateral
section
has
skids
and
wheels
to
pull
the
entire
lateral
to
the
next
set
position.
You
can
see
here
these
are
the
wheels
where
the
entire
system
is
brought
from
one
position
to
the
next
position.
A
tractor
hooked
to
the
main
end
attached
with
the
lateral
to
drag
laterals
in
other
directions
across
the
mainline
in
an
opposite S-shaped curve. Easier to move when main lines are buried.
This
is
not
used
extensively
as
the
moving
lateral
may
damage
the
crops.
So
basically
those
crops
which
are
of
the
low-value
crop
means
not
very
expensive,
this
system
is
used.
So
mainly
for
the
forage
or
the
row
crops,
it
is
being
used.
This
is
another
kind
of
system
that
is
a
side-roll
or
wheel-move
system.
And
the
lateral
you
can
see
lateral
is
kept
inside
and
on
the
top,
this
is
connected
with
the
wheel.
So
it
is
a
mechanically
moved
system.
It
is
taken
from
one
place
to
another
place
mechanically
and
each
section
of
the
pipe
in
a
side-roll
lateral
has
the
wheel.
And
the
pipe
serving
as
the
axle
of the wheel.
A
diesel-operated
engine
or
transmission
with
the
reverse
gear
supplies
the
power
needed
to
roll
the
lateral
of
length
up
to
800
m
from
one
set
of
positions
to
the
next.
The
lateral
is
commonly
12.2
m
long
having
a
diameter
of
100
to
125
mm
with
awheel
at
its
center
and
the
sprinkler
is
mounted
on
the
short
riser
on
each
end.
This
is
what you see here, how the sprinkler is mounted on this one and it is in action.
A
drain
valve
is
located
opposite
to
each
riser
and
opens
automatically
during
the
pressure
loss.
It
allows
the
lateral
to
drain
and
move
quickly .
So
this
is
the
arrangement
here
we
have.
Then
there
is
a
gun-type
of
set-move
system.
It
consists
of
a
large
volume
gun
sprinkler
mounted
on
a
wheeled
cart
and
trailer
that
is
moved
from
one
set
to
the
set
with
the
tractor
or
by
hand.
Sprinkler
capacity
these
are
of
very
high
capacity
about
4700
liter
per
minute.
It
has
got
a
wetting
diameter
of
about
180
m.
And
it
requires
operating
pressure
from
480
to
896.
You
can
see
these
are
the
guns.
May
be
used
for
a
variety
of
climates.
And
useful
for
large
agricultural
fields,
lawns
playgrounds,
and
turfs.
It
requires
low
maintenance,
easy
to
install.
The
only
thing
that such type of sprinklers it does not have the good uniformity of water distribution.
But
when
we
need
to
operate
at
one
point
of
the
field,
so
the
loss
of
the
crop
as
well
as
the
movement
is
not
restricted.
Such
systems
are
useful.
The
only
thing
that
we
should
have
is
the
portable
water
supply
system
means
the
water
supply
should
be
in
large capacity and it should be available in adequate quantity .
This
is
sprinkler
irrigation
with
mobile
raingun
which
is
another
kind
of
a
thing.
This
has
been,
this
is
another
important
device
which
is
being
used
where
this
is
the
direction
of
travel
and
we
can
see
that
how
the
system
can
be
rated.
So
this
is
a
mobile
raingun.
Now
this
is
important
and
some
places
it
is
being
used
and
it
is
being
available marketed in India also.
Now
we
learned
in
the
previous
part
about
the
different
components
of
micro
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
Now
let
us
come
to
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system
components.
So
a
typical
sprinkler
component,
it
is
taking
water
from
a
source.
This
source
of
water
can
be
a
well,
it
can
be
a
pond,
it
can
be
a
reservoir ,
it
can
be
aflowing
stream
and
then
there
is
a
pump.
Now
this
pump
here
what
you
see
that
it
is
a
coupled with the electric motor .
So
this
can
be
again
operated
by
some
prime
mower .
So
maybe
gasoline
or
it
can
be
operated
this
pump
can
be
operated
with
the
diesel
engine.
And
this
is
the
suction
end
of
the
pump.
And
this
is
the
delivery
end
of
the
pump.
So
the
suction
end
of
the
pump
it is provided with a coupling and then it comes to the check valve.
So
check
valve
basically
it
is
checking
the
flow
or
supplying
the
flow
as
per
the
desired
quantity .
Further ,
it
is
controlled
by
a
gate
valve.
And
then
there
is
a
larger
when
we
want
to
extend
the
line.
So
there
is
a
coupling
where
we
can
enlar ge.
So
from
the
delivery
end
of
the
pipeline
of
the
pump,
the
pipeline
is
extended,
and
then
it
is coming to another component which we can see there is a telescopic union.
So
this
is
the
main
pipeline.
And
then
this
main
pipeline
when
we
want
to
divert
water
to
this
direction
so
there
is
a
T
connection.
So
this
T
is
further
connected
with
a
lateral
pipeline.
This
is
a
sprinkler
lateral.
And
on
this
sprinkler
lateral
the
riser
pipeline
is
attached.
And
this
riser
pipeline
has
got
a
sprinkler
head.
So
these
sprinkler
heads
are
provided at an appropriate location depending on the requirement.
Then
in
order
to
terminate
the
lateral
flow
into
the
lateral,
there
is
an
end
plug
has
been
provided.
And
then
the
water
when
we
want
to
apply
water
to
the
set
of
laterals
just
now
when
I
was
telling
you
about
the
solid
set
system,
so
there
you
will
have
such
type
of
laterals
which
are
permanently
fixed.
And
then
there
will
be
a
set
of
laterals. So this is one lateral, this is another lateral.
Like
this,
there
can
be
several
laterals.
And
then
in
this
lateral
again
there
is
the
one
connection
which
is
the
elbow .
So
with
the
elbow ,
using
the
elbow ,
water
can
be
this
particular
lateral
can
be
connected
with
another
sprinkler
head
is
mounted
and
by
using
the
coupler
with
the
riser
pipe
and
a
sprinkler .
So
this
is
and
then
at
the
end
of
the pipeline, lateral pipeline, there is an end plug.And
then
water
it
goes
in
the
line
and
it
can
be
made
in
both
sides.
So
there
could
be
both
the
side
the
water
can
be
supplied.
So
means
the
line
can
be
terminated
depending
on
the
requirement
or
it
can
be
diverted
in
one
direction
or
water
can
be
diverted
in
other
directions,
both
the
directions.
This
will
depend
upon
the
requirement.
So
components
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
consist
of
a
pump
which
gives
adequate
pressure.
It
consists
of
the
network
of
the
pipeline.
Those
pipelines
can
be
the
main
pipeline,
sub-main
pipeline
depending
upon
the
requirement
when
the
size
is
very
large
it
can
have,
and
then
there
are
sprinklers,
couplers
valves,
risers,
bends,
end
plugs. These are the devices that are used in a typical sprinkler system.
So
as
I
told
you
there
is
a
pump.
So
the
pump,
the
purpose
of
the
pump
is
to
provide
enough
pressure
in
the
system
and
are
taking
water
from
the
source.
Maybe
groundwater
from
the
well.
So
pump
create
the
force
means
through
pump
force
is
created
through
the
sprinkler
and
then
the
water
goes
to
the
perforations
in
the
nozzles
if it is a perforated pipeline or it is coming to the sprinkler .
A
high-speed
centrifugal
pump
or
turbine
pump
can
be
used
depending
on
the
requirement,
depending
on
the
place
where
the
how
the
water
is
taken.
If
the
water
is
taken
from
less
than
8
m
suction
head
then
the
centrifugal
pump
is
used
or
submersible
pump
when
the
depth
of
water
is
greater
than
8
m.
So
these
are
some
of
the guidelines.
In
fact,
the
pump
position
can
be
when
I
was
taking
class,
you
can
see
that
how
the
position
of
the
pump
can
be
shifted
when
the
deep
water
is
there,
submersible
pump
or
centrifugal
pump
that
already
I
have
explained
you.
So
these
pumps
can
be
driven
by using an electric motor or internal combustion engine, IC engines.
Pipe
networks
as
I
told
you
that
these
are
the
main
or
sub-main
pipeline
and
the
main
or
sub-main
pipeline
supplies
water
to
the
lateral.
These
are
normally
made
up
ofPVC
or
HDPE
lateral
supplies
water
to
the
sprinklers.
They
can
be
laid
below
or
above ground level. Then on these laterals, risers are mounted.
These
risers
are
of
smaller
diameter
pipeline
and
then
the
height
of
the
riser
pipe
is
normally
1
m,
less
than
90
cm
to
1
m.
But
when
there
is
the
plant
height
or
crop
height
is
more,
say
in
the
case
of
the
sugarcane
crop,
the
height
of
the
riser
pipe
can
be
made.
However
to
get
the
support
a
tripod
is
needed
for
each
individual
riser
pipe
to support this one so that it does not fall.
So
a
portable
sprinklers
could
be
aluminum,
PVC.
Now
aluminum
pipeline
is
not
used,
it
could
be
made
up
with
the
PVC.
These
pipelines
are
made
up
of
PVC
or
HDPE.
A
sprinkler
can
be
a
fixed
type
or
rotating
head
sprinkler .
Fixed
head
sprinklers
mean
it
forms
a
spray
type
of
sprinkler .
It
depends
on
the
smooth
and
grooved
cones
deflector
kind
of
a
thing
that
where
when
it
is
used
mainly
it
is
used
for
increasing
the
humidity .
This
requires
relatively
lesser
pressure.
Whereas
rotating
sprinklers
it
requires more pressure.
And
the
rotating
head
sprinkler
could
be
of
impact
type,
gear-driven
type,
or
reaction
type.
So
they
have
one
or
more
nozzles.
Means
one
nozzle
is
a
range
nozzle
which
is
and
another
one
in
the
spreader
nozzle.
Spreader
nozzle,
the
water
spreads
near
the
riser
pipeline,
and
then
as
well
as
the
range
nozzle,
it
spread
the
water
at
the
distance
part.
These
jets
are
rotated
in
a
start
and
stop
strike
the
impact
and
then
bounce
out
one
of
the
jets.
The
spring
returns
on
to
strike
the
jet
again
repeatedly .
This
is
the
action it does in case of your rotating head impact type of sprinkler .
The
constant
diameter
nozzles
mean
these
are
the
diameters
are
normally
it
is
of
the
same
size
and
it
is
made
in
such
a
way
that
it
delivers
the
constant
dischar ge.
Diffuse
jet
nozzles,
this
is
mainly
for
creating
the
humidity
in
a
particular
place
mainly
in
the
smaller these are of smaller size. In the greenhouses, such types of sprinklers are used.Impact
sprinkler ,
this
is
what
you
see
here
that
it
is
a
twin
nozzle.
So
this
nozzle
is
the
range
nozzle
and
this
is
a
spreader
nozzle.
And
the
jet
coming
out
of
this,
this
strikes
here
and
then
this
spring
it
brings
it
back.
So
once
it
strikes
this
particular
arm
deflects
and
then
supplies
the
water .
Normally ,
the
angle
of
throw
from
this
one,
this
is
the
trajectory
this
is
32
degree
and
this
is
a
bearing,
on
this
bearing,
the
sprinkler
rotates about its axis.
You
can
see
these
are
the
different
components.
This
is
an
oscillating
arm
shaft
and
this
is
the
oscillating
arm
which
oscillates
when
the
jet
ejects
out
of
this
one.
So
it
brings
back.
So
already
I
have
explained
you,
so
this
goes.
Then
a
gear-driven
type
of
sprinklers
are
there.
It
is
driven
by
a
small
water
turbine
located
at
the
base
of
the
sprinkler .
Series
of
gears
are
used
to
reduce
the
speed
of
the
turbine.
It
may
have
one
or
more
jet
that
rotates
around
the
vertical
axis
of
the
sprinkler .
Unlike
the
impact
type
of sprinkler , gear -driven sprinklers rotate smoothly without any splash.
There
are
reaction
type
of
sprinklers
rotated
by
torque
produced
by
the
reaction
of
water
leaving
the
sprinkler
jet.
This
is
the
thing
which
is
making
in
the
majority
of
the
impact
type
of
sprinklers
also.
When
the
jet
leaves
the
water ,
it
creates
torque.
That
is
causing the movement of water and it operates at low pressure between 70 to 210 kPa.
Now
other
components
of
the
sprinkler
systems
are
they
are
you
know
very
important
component
and
these
are
as
important
as
the
sprinkler
system
because
these
are
needed?
So
couplers
for
coupling
the
pipeline,
water
meter
to
monitor
the
flow.
Flanges
and
couplings.
They
are
required
for
proper
connection
to
the
pump
and
suction
and
delivery
end.
Pressure
gauge.
It
is
another
important
component
to
monitor
the
pressure
how
at
what
pressure
the
pump
is
operating.
At
what
pressure
water
is
being
flowing
in
the
main
pipeline,
sub-main
pipeline.
And
also
to
monitor
the flow from the how much at what pressure sprinkler is ejecting the dischar ge.
Bends,
tees,
reducer ,
elbows,
hydrants,
butterfly
valves,
and
plugs.
These
are
all
important
components.
So
you
can
see
here
this
is
the
quick
release
coupling
QRC
which
is
made
up
of
high-density
polyethylene.
So
these
are
the
QRC.
This
is
the
endplug.
All
this
is
made
up
of
HDPE
or
PVC.
Of
course,
this
is
the
end
plug
and
then
there
is
a
rubber
gasket
at
the
end.
So
water
does
not
come
out
of
this.
This
is
a
tee.
When
we
want
to
divert
water
at
90
degree,
or
it
is
a
bend.
So
such
type
of
devices
are
required when we want to connect the pipeline with one.
This
is
the
threaded
pipeline,
of
course,
steel
pipeline
pipe.
Sometimes
it
is
needed.
Of
course,
now
slowly
all
these
couplings
which
were
made
up
of
GI
pipeline
or
steel
pipeline
this
has
been
replaced
with
the
PVC.
The
only
thing
that
is
where
the
riser
pipe is to be so this is made up of brass or gunmetal at this place.
And
then
on
this
place,
you
can
see
here
this
is
the
one
part
and
then
sprinkler
riser
pipe
is
attached
this
one.
This
is
the
quick
coupling
aluminum
pipeline.
These
were
being
used
earlier .
Now
aluminum
pipeline
has
been
fully
replaced
with
PVC
or
HDPE. This is the rigid PVC.
So
this
particular
topic
you
can
go
in
detail,
refer
these
books
by
James,
by
Professor
Michael, quite a good information is available. You can also have internet references.
So
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
the
sprinkler
system
which
is
based
on
the
portability
or
moving
system.
We
discussed
about
the
components and what are the dif ferent components which are there.
In
the
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
discuss
about
what
are
the
design
considerations
and
then
what
is
the
system
hydraulics.
So
thank
you
very
much
for
patience
in
hearing.
