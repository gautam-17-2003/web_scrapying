Precision Agricultur e
Hello,
participants.
We
are
now
starting
Lecture
59.
This
is
another
interesting
lecture
and
here
we
will
be
talking
about
precision
agriculture.
It
is
one
of
the
important
upcoming
areas
of
research
and
application
in
the
field
and
particularly ,
when
we
are
talking
of
improving
agricultural
productivity .
And
then,
giving
precision
amount
of
irrigation
precision
amount
of
other
inputs
like
fertilizers,
nutrient
based
on
considering
the
field
variability
in
a
large
area
or even in a small area, if there are there is any field variability it exist.
So,
here,
we
will
talk
about
the
precision
agriculture.
What
are
the
different
components
of
precision
agriculture?
How
micro
irrigation
has
relevance
in
precision
agriculture?
So,
these
are the topics which will we will discuss in this, particularly on precision agriculture.
Now ,
why
precision
agriculture?
You
see
when
we
are
talking
about
sun
as
a
source
of
energy
which
is
responsible
for
photosynthesis
of
the
crop,
so,
irradiation
of
sun,
natural
water
supply ,
the
soil
properties
and
the
demand
of
the
market
these
are
all
not
just
uniform
at
all.
So,
if
this
is
varying,
we
need
to
make
changes.
So,
even
within
the
small
regions
or
within
a
farm,
soil
properties
and
its
quality
in
terms
of
the
nutrient
status,
in
terms
of
the
availability
of
moisture
content,
in
terms
of
the
other
physical
parameters
and
the
slope
of
the
field,
these
can be dif ferent.
So,
to
in
order
to
get
sustainable
and
economical
farming
operations
it
requires
precise
adaption
of
natural
and
economic
conditions.
So,
permanent
and
precise
adjusting
to
the
varying
site-specific
soil-crop
condition
in
the
field
can
address
environmental
needs
much
better
and
ensure
greater
yield.
This
is
the
rationale
for
site-specific
precision
farming
or
precision agriculture.Managing
irrigation
throughout
the
field
in
a
short
duration,
this
is
the,
another
important
aspect
which
requires
precision
agriculture
or
precision
farming.
Within
a
single
field
in
a
site-specific
way
allow
reduce
nutrient
quantity
needed
while
maintaining
the
yields
thereby
improving
the
nutrient
use
efficiency .
Means,
when
there
is
a
variability
and
instead
of
giving
uniform
amount
of
nutrient
all
throughout
the
field,
one
can
take
decision
after
getting
the
data
and
smaller
amount,
when
you
are
applying
as
compared
to
the
uniform
amount
of
nutrient
application
all
throughout
field.
We
will
be
improving
the
nutrient
use
efficiency
of
the
crop.
So,
site-specific
fertilizing
relies
either
on
the
removal
of
nutrients
by
preceding
crops means previous crop or on the supply in the soil as well as growing plant needs.
So,
site-specific
control
in
application
of,
say
fungicides
means,
other
chemicals,
and
fungicides
would
be
the
requirement
that
can
be
based
on
spatial
difference
of
the
crop
biomass
or
on
infected
loci.
Means,
wherever
there
is
a
location
where
there
is
a
problem,
exactly
at
that
particular
location,
fungicide
application
can
be
given.
So,
precision
farming
technique
comply
to
a
spatial,
temporal
and
the
rate
at
which
various
farming
operations
fulfill
their
function,
to
do
with
right
thing,
at
the
right
place,
and
at
the
right
time.
So,
there
are
3
R’s
here.
Right
thing
means
exactly
what
is
to
be
done
exactly
at
that
particular
location.
So,
at
appropriate
location
and
at
appropriate
time,
this
is
important
when
we
are
talking about precision farming or precision agriculture.
So,
precision
agriculture
or
precision
farming
it
involves
application
of
technologies
and
principles
to
manage
spatial,
temporal
variability
associated
with
all
aspects
of
agricultural,
horticultural,
aqua
cultural
production
for
improving
crop
performance
and
environment
quality
through
efficient
management
of
resources
using
location
specific
hi-tech
interventions. We will discuss, what is the meaning of here hi-tech interventions?
Means,
we
will
use
the
sensor
technologies
where
and
then
apply
exactly
at
the
appropriate
location.
So,
sensor ,
GIS,
GPS
all
these
things
we
will
be
coming
to
this
part.
So,
when
we
call
of
that
precision
agriculture
or
precision
farming,
it
means
these
are
the
commonly
used
terms.
Site
specific
farming,
SSF,
this
is
also
one
term
which
is
used.
We
also
sometimes
we
use
site
specific
management.
It
is
not
the
same
management.
Or,
same
specific
operations
are
to
be
done
uniformly
to
the
whole
farm
or
whole
field
which
was
in
practice.
Still,
we
areusing.
But,
what
I
am
telling
when
we
talk
of
precision
agriculture
means
we
need
to
apply
exactly
what
is
the,
at
that
particular
location,
particular
management
practices
are
to
be
adopted. Farming by foot means step by step you just go there and then do.
And
so,
whole
field
at
some
place
means
we
need
to
give
lower
quantity
of
water ,
smaller
quantity
of
water
somewhere
moisture
content
is
very
low.
Suppose,
whole
field
it
is
of
various
soil
texture.
Now ,
the
whole
field
of
100
acre
farm
and
you
may
find
that
25
acre
has
got
one
type
of
soil
another
25
acre
has
got
another
type
of
soil
means
there
are
4
types
of
soil, it has got dif ferent texture.
It
has
got
different
nutrient
requirements,
different
crops,
and
different
types
of
diseases.
So,
naturally ,
variable
rate
technology
is
required
to
make
the
agriculture
to
happen
precision
way.
So,
this
particular
diagram
when
you
see,
this
diagram,
precision
agriculture,
it
requires
the
data
acquisition.
This
is
the
one
very
important
component
that
is
the
data
acquisition
where
the
crops,
soil,
terrain,
climate,
all
these
data
which
are
to
be
collected
by
using
the
precision instruments.
These
precision
instruments
could
be
sensors.
And
then,
they
are
to
be
put
up
in
a
data
logger
or
in
a
server
it
is
brought.
And
then,
this
information
which
is
extracted
from
the
server
are
stored
in
this.
Then,
it
needs
the
processing.
So,
these
data
are
processed
or
mapped
properly
at
which
place
this
particular
information
it
is
there.
So,
we
will
be
using
the
data
which
will
be
ancillary
data,
data
analysis.
It
is
a
geospatial
data
means
your
geo-statistical
programming.
And
then,
we
will
take
appropriate
decision.
So,
support
system,
we
will
apply
the
decision
support
system
which
will
be
economical.
And
then,
a
specific
operations
or
management
such
as
your
irrigation,
fertilization,
crop
production,
such
type
of
things
which
will
be
done.
And
then,
so,
all
these
operations
which
are
involved
as
per
the,
depending
on
the, site specific condition that is a precision agriculture.
It
involves
as
I
told
you
it
involves
lot
of
things
and
the
government
of
India
is
supporting
for
the
digitalization
of
the
information.
So,
digital
agriculture,
the
precision
agriculture
is
also
known
as
a
digital
agriculture.
Means,
we
are
getting
information,
digitize
the
whole
field
what
are
the
information
it
is
available.
So,
digital
technologies
it
has
future.
It
can
play
avery
important
transformation
role
in
modernizing
and
organizing
how
rural
India
performs
in agricultural activities.
So,
this
will
involve
artificial
intelligence,
this
will
involve
the
Big
Data
Analytics.
It
will
involve
Block-chain
Technology .
It
will
involve
3D
Printing,
IoT
and
other
as
they
are
developed.
So,
these
information
which
were
being
used
earlier
in
the
industries
or
in
other
operations,
now,
in
agriculture,
these
technologies
have
got
importance.
So,
appropriate
and
time of operation, such technologies can lead to smart and the sustainable farming.
So,
there
exist
various
similar
technologies
where
sample
from
the
field
gets
converted
into
digital
information,
is
promptly
analyzed
to
provide
accurate
results,
which
then
allows
farmers
or
any
crop
growers
to
take
decision
best
suited
to
the
land
they
farm
on.
Means,
where
they
this
cultivation
is
being
done.
So,
it
has
a
very
important
role.
Now ,
digitization
program,
digitizing
rural
areas,
villages,
this
has
come
a
very
big
way
in
modern
agriculture.
And,
this
should
be
utilized
so
as
to
the
productivity
can
be
increased
and
then
resources
can
be ef fectively utilized.
So,
what
are
the
different
steps
involve
in
precision
agriculture
or
precision
farming?
There
is
one
part
is
that
is
whole
field
is
to
be
monitored.
Means
data
will
be
collected
through
assessing
the
variability ,
how
much
variability
means,
assessing
the
variability
and
reporting
simultaneously with space and time. That is a variable assessment.
So,
data
are
to
be
collected
and
how
a
small
piece
of
land
data
are
being
collected
and
that
is
with
space
and
time.
So,
spatial
variability
and
temporal
variability
can
be
monitored.
Managing
variability ,
action
according
to
the
variability
means,
if
there
is
a
variation
from
the
nutritional
point
of
view
whether
how
about
the
fertility
point
of
view ,
how
about
the
crop,
and
infestation
it
has
got
the
pest
infestation.
Or,
there
is
a
deficiency
due
to
soil
moisture
content.
So,
we
need
to
take
appropriate
action.
The
success
of
precision
farming
or
precision
agriculture,
it
depends
upon
how
precisely ,
soil
fertility ,
pest
information,
crop
management
with
respect
to
biotic
and
abiotic
variables
and
water
are
managed
in
the
field
and
also
how
accurately the corrective actions have been taken as a part of variability noticed in the field.The
basic
purpose
is
this
one
we
are
assessing
but
we
need
to
take
appropriate
action.
Simply
collecting
data
will
not
help.
So,
evaluation,
once
we
are
doing,
we
need
to
evaluate
whether
it
is
economically
viable.
So,
assessment
in
terms
of
economic
viability ,
maintenance
of
environment.
That
is
one
part
means
every
time
we
cannot
think
say
that
it
is
not
economically viable. There are indirect benefits that it comes in terms of environment.
So,
one
cannot
notice
when
the
over
irrigation
is
being
done
and
you
are
saving
water .
So,
you
have
used
some
kind
of
irrigation
system
means
the
side
effect
are
overuse
of
water
or
fertilizer
that
is
polluting
the
water
and
that
might
one
cannot
think
of
that
how
it
is
dangerous.
So,
economic
part
may
not
be
evaluated
properly
but
environment
point,
social
health
point
of
view ,
and
the
water
quality
point
of
view .
So,
this
needs
to
be
another
maintenance
of
environment
that
should
be
evaluated.
Feasibility
of
technology
transfer
and
benefit to the market mechanism needs proper evaluation then only we can say .
Now ,
there
are
several
components
which
are
you
know
our
facilitator
for
implementation
of
precision
agriculture.
So,
several
components
are
there,
different
technologies
which
have
come
and
this
needs
to
be
applied.
Now ,
you
can
see
here
remote
sensing.
The
remote
sensing
data
means
the
data
are
being
collected
from
the
land
surface
by
using
satellite.
Now ,
there
could
be
normal
means
for
operating
data,
getting
data,
we
use
polar
orbiting
satellites
where
the
data
are
being
collected
in
terms
of
the
spatial
point
of
view .
That
how
small
means
spatial
resolution
point
of
view
and
then
data
are
being
collected.
Temporally ,
how
quickly
we are getting the data and then second part is that what kind of the data we are looking for .
So,
spectral
resolution
will
give
us
information
that
the
particular
crop
and
then
taking
those
digital
data
in
different
bands.
And,
analyzing
these
data
by
using
appropriate
remote
sensing
data
processing
technique
is
to
be
applied.
Image
processing
technique
will
be
applied.
So,
drones,
you
can
see
here
the
drones
is
being
used
for
precision
farming
and
then
site
specific
management.
So,
drones,
sensors,
one
is
the
sensors
which
are
already
there
in
the
platform,
in
the
satellite
or
aerial,
but
there
are
sensors
which
could
be
on
the
ground.
So,
ground
sensors
as
well
as
monitoring
from
the
remote
place.
Those
are
the
sensors
which
will
be
use.
Then
getting
datain
different
that
is
from
the
geospatial
point
of
view .
How
the
data
are
there
making
different
themes
different
layers
using
the
geographical
information
system
and
global
positioning
system that at what place what kind of action is to be taken that is by using the satellites..
There
are
24
satellites
which
are
there
in
the
space
for
monitoring
the
position.
So,
location
point
of
view ,
the
type
of
data
or
information
being
collected.
Then
auto
analyzer
that
is
another
thing.
That
computer
and
internet
these
are
the
facilitator .
Means
data
will
be
analyzed
and
then
we
will
transport
the
data,
so
internet,
computer
facilities,
variable
rate
applicator
and
then
getting
data
in
different
bands,
analyzing
them.
So,
Big
Data
Analysis,
IoT
that
is
Internet
of
Things,
connecting
things
from
one
to
other
devices.
That
is
Internet
of
Things.
And
then,
Artificial
Intelligence
means
using
the
techniques
of
mathematical
techniques
to
analyze
those
data
by
using
AI,
robots
for
taking
action.
So,
there
are
huge
amount
of
the
technologies
which
are
in
means
associated
with
the
precision
agriculture
and
not
all
will
be
means
I
am
prescribing.
But,
yes,
these
are
the
components
which
are
being
used for the precision agriculture.
So,
let
us
try
to
know
the
different
component.
I
told
about
the
remote
sensing.
It
is
giving
synoptic
area
that
overall
view
of
the
whole
field
with
the
data
could
be
in
the
form
of
spatial,
multi
spectral.
So,
this
is
one
advantage
that
is
for
the
different
spatial
resolution.
Means,
different
sizes
of
the
field
and
how
small
one
can
view
that
will
reflect
with
the
spatial
data.
Smaller
pixels
sizes
that
will
give
this
from
this
spatial
point
of
view .
And
then,
multi
spectral,
getting
data
in
multi
spectral,
multi
band,
multi
spectral
range.
So,
maybe
data
we
need
from
the
reflectance
point
of
view .
We
may
be
interested
to
get
data
emitted
point
of
view
means
temperature
data.
How?
So,
infrared
data,
when
we
are
collecting
infrared
temperature data, you are getting, that would be another way .
So,
it
has
got
a
good
promise
of
precision
farming
or
precision
agriculture.
Remote
sensing
measures
data
as
I
told
you
that
in
a
multi
spectral
band,
so,
it
could
be
visible
or
invisible
properties
of
the
field.
And
then,
the
information
this
is
spatial
information
at
what
place
what
kind
of
a
thing
it
exists.
There
are
large
number
of
now
satellites
in
the
space.
Those
are
being used. These are our Indian satellites.There
are
high
precision
and
then
low
spatial
resolution
satellites
are
available
which
is
now
we
are
getting
data
in
the
order
of
less
than
a
meter .
Such
data
are
available.
So,
these
are
the
older
satellite
where
these
resolution
was
up
to
the
order
of
4
point
means,
the
23
meter
P6
when
we
are
talking
that
23
meter .
But
now,
the,
there
are
satellite
where
the
information
is
available
up
to
4
less
than
a
meter .
LANDSA T,
which
this
is
an
American
satellite
and
SPOT ,
is
the
satellite
from
this
France;
so,
these
satellites
data
are
being
used.
And
then,
we
also
did
work
in
the
year
2009.
Where
it
is
given
that
should
such
work,
it
has
been
done
and
we
will
discuss in the coming lecture.
So,
the
drones,
application
of
drones
in
precision
agriculture,
this
technology
has
changed
over
time.
And
now,
these
drones
are
available
means
when
I
was
telling
about
the
spatial
resolution,
so,
these
are
capable
of
collecting
information
up
to
the
order
of
you
can
see
0.5
centimeter
or
as
5
millimeter
to
10
centimeter
resolution.
So,
each
and
every
bit
of
the
field
information
can
be
collected.
So,
this
application
of
drone
we
call
it
as
a
UAV.
That
is
unmanned
aerial
vehicle
where
the,
this
cameras
of
multi
spectral
bands
are
mounted
on
this
particular
thing
and
data
are
being
collected.
This
is
what
you
are
seeing
here.
The
data
can
be
collected.
And
also,
site
specific
application
of
the
nutrient
or
chemical
can
be
done
at
appropriate location instead of giving uniformly to all the fields.
So,
drone
can
be
used
for
conducting
aerial
survey .
This
is
what
I
was
telling
you
that
yes
data
on
the
crop
health,
data
on
the
soil
nutrient,
plant,
and
all
kinds
of
information
that
can
be
collected.
So,
the
difference
in
the
land
use,
what
is
the
crop
loss?
Or,
what
is
the
health
of
the
crop?
That
image
can
be
made.
And
then,
we
can
integrate
with
the
geographical
information
system
in
order
to
take
the
decision.
Now ,
drones
are
being,
it
has
got
multi
spectral
data
where
thermal,
visual
as
well
as
other
sensor
data
it
can
be
loaded
in
the
drones
and
then
data
can
be
collected.
Now ,
drones
have
been
used
for
application
of
the
chemical
particularly
pesticide
as
and
where
it
is
required.
So,
depending
upon
the
sensors
employed
on the drone, various data can be captured to monitor the plant health index.
To
monitor
the
plant
counting
means
up
to
this
level
because
I
was
telling
you
that
up
to
10
centimeter
resolution
means
0.5
to
10
centimeter
resolution.
So,
one
can
find
out,
how
many
number
of
plants
available
there?
What
is
the
plant
height
measurement?
Whether
there
is
awater
shortage
means
chlorophyll
measurement,
nitrogen
content,
drainage
mapping,
and
weed. How much is the weed infestation? Such type of data it is possible.
Sensors
is
the
another
means
there
are
devices
which
are
used
to
monitor
the
soil
moisture
content,
soil
temperature.
GIS
is
the,
another
system
where
we
can
one
can
link
the
different
layers
can
be
made,
soil,
crop,
weather ,
field
history .
There
could
be
several
models
that
can
be
used.
And,
this
support
the
several
components
particularly
GPS
guided
machines
and
GIS
is used for precision farming.
GPS
to
find
out
the
exact
location
in
the
field,
where
we
are
there
and
what
kind
of
information
it
is
available
or
a
particular
device
it
is
taken.
Tractor
is
taken.
And
then,
one
can apply the fertilizer or those things that is possible.
Now ,
information
database,
that
information
database,
it
could
be
on
soil,
it
could
be
on
crop
and
it
could
be
on
climate.
So,
there
are
several
things
which
are
there.
So,
you
can
see
data
analyzer ,
the
land
means
it
will
be
auto
analyzer .
It
will
give
the
information
that,
what
is
the
land
elevation?
What
is
the
soil
moisture
content?
What
is
the
nutrient
status?
What
is
the
plant water? All kinds of this data, so, by auto analyzer , information can be generated.
This
is
a
minimum
thing
which
is
needed
when
we
are
talking
of
digital
agriculture.
So,
personal
computer
and
internet
these
things
are
there.
Variable
rate
applicator ,
this
already
I
have
explained
you
that
this
is
the
variable
rate
applicator .
It
means
this
is
the
instrument
or
it
is
the
device
which
will
be
applying
the
particular
chemical
or
giving
the
information
that
how
much
amount
of
water ,
how
much
amount
of
nutrient
it
can
be
given
or
herbicide
can
be
given.
So,
basically ,
this
is
the
information
where
this
we
will
be
getting
based
on
the
information we got from the GPS.
Big
Data,
as
the
name
it
says
that
there
is
a
huge
quantity
of
data
from
agriculture.
We
are
being
we
are
getting.
So,
data
analytics
provide
the
opportunity
to
systematize
the
large
amount
of
widely
dispersed
data
that
is
generated
from
agriculture
or
other
allied
activities.
So, these data are to be integrated when after the analysis.IoT
as
the
name
is
says
that
Internet
of
Things.
And
basically ,
it
means
that
internet
interconnectivity
of
all
the
connectable
things.
So,
this
is
important
thing
that
it
will
connecting
between
people
to
people
that
is
by
IoT
we
can
do,
people
to
device
and
device
to
device.
So,
this
is
all
involved
in
the
IoT.
So,
this
allows
the
things
to
digitally
interact
to
trigger , take a particular action on the basis of usable information or predetermined flags.
AI
that
is
the
Artificial
Intelligence,
so,
sensors
provide
data
that
can
be
used
to
automate
a
specific
task
on
the
triggers
provided.
So,
AI
it
takes
automation
to
another
level
by
incorporating
analysis
and
learning
on
the
basis
of
the
past
and
current
data.
So,
there
is
a
needs
a
several
algorithms
to
be
developed
for
taking
decisions.
So,
this
support
the
decision
making
process
using
the
machine
or
digital
learning
processes.
So,
here,
it
involves
data
collection.
Say,
and
then,
it
is
brought
say
image
processing.
These
data
which
is
collected
from
using
a
specific
device
whether
the
multi
spectral
camera
loaded
on
the
drone
the
data
are brought where the Artificial Intelligence will be applied to take decision.
So,
human
intelligence
can
take
long
or
assimilate
to
stimulate
the
understand
react
to
all
the
complex
variables
that
comprise
the
uncertainty
that
agriculture
is
subject
to.
So,
there
are
certain
Artificial
Intelligence,
it
helps
to
make
better
sense
of
inherent
fuzzy
data
and
rapidly
put
out
answers
from
the
extremely
complex
input.
So,
these
are
the
operations
which
are
performed.
Then,
robots
and
sensors,
these
are
the
other
things
which
are
used
in
agriculture.
It
has
come
in
the
in
a
big
way
in
agriculture
also.
And
particularly ,
in
greenhouse
operations,
these are done.
Now ,
precision
farming
in
context
to
irrigation
water
management.
So,
some
work
which
has
been
done
at
Precision
Farming
Development
Center ,
which
there
were
22
centers,
which
were
supported
by
Ministry
of
Agriculture.
And,
being
coordinated
or
monitored
by
the
National
Committee
on
Plasticulture
Application
in
Horticulture
and
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Farmers
Welfare,
was
funding
these
projects.
So,
here
the
work
which
has
been
done
in
this
field,
some
of
the
results
related
to
precision
agriculture
and
it
is
related
to
application
of
micro
irrigation
for
giving
appropriate
amount
of
water
and
fertilizer .
This
has
been
presented
here.So,
Precision
Farming
Development
Center
as
I
told
you,
these
centers
are
located
in
varied
agro-climatic
regions,
ICAR,
say
at
IIT
Kharagpur
which
I
was
heading
this
particular
center
and
then
State
Agricultural
Universities.
So,
altogether ,
there
were
22
centers.
By
using
the
long
time
research
experiments,
they
establish
the
water
requirement
as
well
as
fertigation
requirement
of
various
crops.
So,
the
studies
which
has
been
carried
out
at
IIT
Kharagpur
on
these
crops,
we
establish
the
water
requirement
under
drip
irrigation
system
of
Mango,
Guava,
Pineapple,
Banana,
Cabbage,
Cauliflower ,
Tomato,
Okra
and
so
this
is
the
variation
in
the
water
requirement
from
the
early
stage
to
the
peak
growth
stage.
These
values
are
useful
when we are applying precision farming technologies.
Similarly ,
we
also
established
the
month
wise
or
weekly
in
fact
daily
values
were
estimated.
And
then,
we
got
the
results.
And
then,
the
results
which
gave
best
output,
only
that
particular
amount
of
water
it
has
been
digitalized
and
then
given
to
this
crop.
So,
you
can
see
Banana
is
a
1
year
crop.
And,
these
are
the
values
of
amount
of
water
to
be
given
in
different
months.
That
is
the
daily
amount
of
water
in
liter
to
be
given.
Similarly ,
for
the
Pineapple,
Tomato,
these
are
the
vegetable
crop.
Tomato,
Okra,
Potato,
and
Cabbage.
And
then,
Guava
and
Mango, these are the fruit crops. So, we established water requirement of these crops.
Then,
we
also,
means,
these
studies
were
carried
out
by
these
centers
for
the
variety
of
crops.
Only
few
crops
we
are
listing
here
where
the
fertigation
dose
say
Broccoli
which
was
irrigated
by
using
the
drip
irrigation
and
fertigation
was
given.
This
study
was
carried
out
at
PFDC,
IARI
in
New
Delhi.
And
then,
these
are
the
recommended
doses
and
that
every
15
days
after
the
transplanting
which
give
the
best
result.
And,
this
particular
crop
was
planted
in
October
to
March.
Then,
another
crop
that
is
a
fruit
crops.
This
study
was
carried
out
at
IIT
Kharagpur .
And
then,
we
also
carried
out,
recommended
the
dose
of
fertilizer
by
using
the
drip irrigation system. So, this is the, another precision farming technology has been applied.
Then,
the
other
crop
you
can
see
here.
It
is
a
Carnation.
The
study
has
been
done
at
MPKV ,
Rahuri.
The
crop
it
took
about
24
to
36
months.
And
here,
the
NPK
values,
that
is
nitrogen,
phosphorus
and
potassium,
these
values,
their
doses
has
been
recommended
and
these
were
given.
So,
another
study
it
is
carried
out
on
the
Capsicum
crop
by
Central
Institute
ofAgricultural
Engineering,
Bhopal
located
in
Bhopal
for
the
drip
irrigation
and
fertigation.
So,
there also, the, this recommendation has been given.
So,
the
purpose
of
giving
you
this
information
that
one
can
apply
water
as
well
as
fertilizer
based
on
the
requirement
in
the
field.
So,
if
this
field
is
having
the
differential
amount
of
nutrient
status
and
soil
moisture
status
then
drip
irrigation
or
micro
irrigation,
it
will
be
applied and depending on the requirement.
The,
another
study
which
we
did
at
Tarafeni
South
Main
Canal
command
where
normally
irrigation
it
is
being
done
uniformly .
So,
here,
our
purpose
was
to
establish
the
spatial
variation
because
the
crop
means
farmers
they
do
not
sow
the
crop
at
the
same
time.
There
will
be
difference
maybe
15
to
20
days
or
even
to
a,
sometime
it
is
1
month
in
the
delay .
So,
the
amount
of
water
to
be
given,
it
will
have
the
different
values.
So,
this
particular
study
was
carried
out
by
Dr.
N.
K.
Gontia.
So,
here,
it
is
done
at
Tarafeni
Main
Canal
command
of
Kangsabati
River .
We
tried
to
found
out
from
the
spectral
data
NDVI
that
is
Normalized
Difference
Vegetation
Index
and
the
Soil
Adjusted
Vegetation
Index
by
using
the
satellite
data.
The
data
were
from
IRS
P6
where
the
4
means
wide
field
sensor
WiFS
data
of
the
different
months
during
winter
season.
This
period
it
was
done.
And
then,
from
those
data,
the
Kc
as
well
as
the
NDVI
values
relationship
was
established.
So,
between
the
NDVI
and
the
crop
coefficient
established
by
FAO
that
is
Food
and
Agriculture
Organization,
they
have
recommended
the
values.
So,
we
established
and
then
established
relationship.
This
was
using the NDVI. This is using the SA VI value.
So,
you
can
see
here.
These
are
the
monthly
distributed
spatially
distributed
crop
coefficient.
So,
for
December ,
this
is
for
January .
This
is
for
February .
Like
this,
and
then,
March.
So,
when
we
are
getting
the
values
of
the
crop
coefficient
which
is
changing
with
space,
so,
this
is
the
spatially
distributed
crop
coefficients.
So,
it
means,
if
ETo
is
same
for
the
whole
area,
then
we
can
find
out
the
ETc.
So,
that
will
be
the
spatially
distributed
ETc,
similarly ,
SAVI
also.
So,
NDVI
as
well
as
for
SAVI,
we
establish.
Then,
we
establish
the
ETc.
As
I
told
you
that
we
establish
ETc
by
that
is
ETc
is
your
evapotranspiration
requirement
of
the
crop.
So,the
monthly
spatially
distributed
actual
crop
evapotranspiration
that
is
Kc
based
on
the
SAVI
values.
That
maps
of
the
wheat
crop,
the
study
was
published
in
the
year
2009
in
the
journal.
So,
this
information
generated
was
used
to
supply
appropriate
amount
of
water
at
different
locations of irrigation command as per the actual the crop water requirement.
A
considerable
amount
of
water
that
could
be
saved
besides
application
efficiency
of
the
canal
system.
So,
similarly ,
fertilizers
and
other
input
resources
can
be
applied
which
can
save
the
water .
So,
similar
kind
of
studies
for
the
horticultural
crops
can
be
also
done
where
the spatial variability of evapotranspiration requirement, fertilizer requirement can be done.
So,
this
is
the
entire
detail
of
the
data
which
we
analyzed
that
how
much
amount
of
water
that
can
be
estimated
that
can
be
planned.
So,
you
can
see
here
the
ETc
value
for
the
whole
year
means
crop
season.
That
is
from
December
to
the
March.
And
then,
the
amount
of
water
that
total amount of water that can be estimated.
So,
when
we
are
talking
about
the
precision
agriculture,
it
has
some
no
doubt
there
are
some
constant
it
be
particularly
from
Indian
context.
We
have
a
small
land
holding.
And
then,
our
socio
economic
status
of
the
farmers
Indian
farmers
is
not
that
strong.
But,
it
has
lot
of
potential
that
can
be
applied
because,
now,
there
are
several
farmers
they
are
interested
to
work
together .
They
are
farming
cooperative.
So,
using
the
cooperative,
such
technologies
these
are
possible
to
apply .
Lack
of
success
stories,
this
is
another
part
that
farmers
can
be
convinced
when
we
are
giving
the
Benefit
Cost
Ratio.
Knowledge
and
technology
gap,
there
is,
then
the
crop,
farmer
they
do
not
grow
same
crop
in
the
whole
area
so,
that
heterogeneity
in the cropping system.
That
is
another
part
to
implement
precision
agriculture.
Lack
of
market
when
the
produce
is
coming
of
very
high
quality ,
then
market
they
do
not
get.
So,
there
are
some
local
and
technical
expertise
that
is
also
lacking.
And
then,
the
lack
of
data
availability
in
terms
of
quality and cost and so. These instrument when we are talking, it will be useful for them.
So,
these
are
the
references
one
can
use
for
this
particular
topic
to
refer
for
getting
more
detail.So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
discussed
about
precision
agriculture.
We
discussed
about
different
components
of
precision
agriculture
and
then
the
importance
of
digital
farming
technologies
and
how
micro
irrigation
is
relevant
in
precision
farming
or
precision
agriculture.
In
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
be
concluding
this
particular
course
of
Micro
Irrigation Engineering. So, we will discuss in the forthcoming lecture. Thank you very much.
