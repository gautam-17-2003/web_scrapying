Lectur e - 51 
Automation of Micr o Irrigation System (Part-1)
Hello
participants,
I
welcome
you
to
lecture
51
of
micro
irrigation
engineering
course,
lecture
51
is
on
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system.
This
particular
lecture
we
have
divided
in
3
parts
and
because
this
has
got
a
special
importance
in
micro
irrigation
system
and
this
is
a
emer ging
area
where
precision
agriculture
needs
automated
micro
irrigation
system
and
then
there
are
several
important
topics,
development
of
sensor ,
development
of
hardware
components
related
to
the
several
components
are
device
driver
program.
So,
this
particular
lecture it has importance.
Let
us
discuss
on
this
part.
So,
lecture
51
we
will
be
dealing,
why
automation
is
important?
What
is
the
role
of
information
and
communication
technology
as
well
as
internet
of
things
in
my
micro
irrigation
automation?
What
are
the
different
types
of
micro
irrigation
automation
and what are the relevant parameters which will be important with respect to MI automation?
So,
in
this
lecture,
we
are
going
to
cover
why
to
automate
micro
irrigation
system
that
is
the
importance,
what
are
the
specific
features
which
carried
importance.
So,
this
we
will
be
discussing.
Then
in
this
lecture
we
will
talk
of
roll
of
ICT
that
is
information
and
communication
technology
and
IoT
in
micro
irrigation
automation,
what
are
the
different
types
which
are
relevant
to
micro
irrigation
systems
automation.
So,
this
also
we
will
discuss
and then dif ferent parameters.
So,
these
things
we
will
be
talking
differently
and
then
if
we
look
all
parts
of
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
we
will
see
the
first
4
topics
we
are
going
to
cover
and
then
from
item
5
onwards
the
components
deal
with
the
sensors.
So,
what
are
the
different
types
of
sensors,
and
then
what
are
the
controllers,
the
roll
of
controller ,
actuator ,
what
is
the
network
needed
for
the
data
communication,
how
to
operate
the
actuators,
how
to
operate
how
to
tag
with
the
sensor
with
the
controller
using
the
network
system?
What
are
the
relevant
software
which
are
the
program,
device
driver
program,
which
will
operate
the
controller
this
is
alsocomponents
of
automated
micro
irrigation
system
that
particular
part
we
are
going
to
cover
in
a following lectures.
Now ,
a
general
definition
when
we
come
to
what
is
automation?
So,
automation
it
is
a
general
definition
when
we
say
it
is
a
kind
of
innovation
in
which
the
manual
intervention
is
replaced
by
automated
system
to
perform
operation.
So,
what
do
we
see
here,
you
can
see
here
there
is
a
robot
and
robot
is
working
based
on
the
data
fed
maybe
it
is
the
device
which
is
carried
unit
and
that
is
your
mobile,
it
can
be
a
device,
it
can
be
laptop,
it
can
be
any
system.
So,
the
robot
is
all
the
human
intervention
is
replaced
and
then
it
goes
to
the
each
individual
farm
and
carry
out
the
set
of
operations
which
are
required
automatically
without
human intervention.
Automation
is
important
and
what
is
the
automation
in
micro
irrigation
system
that
was
a
general
definition.
So,
a
automation
in
micro
irrigation
system,
it
involves
a
set
of
devices
which
these
devices
automate
the
desired
operations
with
respect
to
MI
when
I
say
means,
operations
related
to
supply
of
irrigation
water ,
supply
of
chemicals
or
nutrient
to
the
crop
with no or minimal manual interventions such as opening and closing of valves.
It
is
starts
and
it
stops
the
pump
as
and
when
required
quantity
of
water
or
nutrient
is
supplied.
So,
when
we
are
using
it
is
reducing
the
energy
consumption.
Normally
this
is
a
problem
when
particularly
for
agriculture
operation
the
power
supply
is
available
during
night
time
and
there
has
been
several
incidents
of
snake
bite
during
night
time,
because
power
light
is
available
which
is
not
enough
that
one
can
see
that
what
is
below
on
the
land
surface.
So,
power
supply
it
is
available
during
night
time
farmer
has
to
be
visit
go
for
operating
the
pump.
So,
this
is
done
by
using
the
automated
system
means
the
irrigation
system
can
be
turned
on
at
any
time.
One
need
not
worry
to
visit
farm
during
odd
time
that
is
during
night
time.
So,
if
it
is
preprogram
it
will
switch
on
switch
off
as
and
when
the
power
supply
is
available
and
adjusting
the
amount
and
time
of
irrigation,
this
is
after
certain
amount
of
water
or
fertilizer
it
has
been
passed
then
and
also
a
given
time
it
is
there.
So,
it
can
switch
off
or
switch on the system.So,
depending
on
the
requirement
it
can
do.
So,
here
more
detail
why
to
automate
micro
irrigation
system.
It
increases
the
quality
and
quantity
of
produce
because
you
are
giving
exactly
in
the
precise
amount.
So,
it
is
not
overdose
it
is
not
under
dose.
It
uses
because
most
of
the
systems
individually
operated
system
it
uses
groundwater .
So,
most
of
the
wells
with
pumps
and
then
that
is
micro
irrigation
system
it
is
connected
with
the
pumping
of
groundwater .
So,
here
optimal
use
of
the
groundwater
it
is
being
done.
It
minimizes
the
adverse
effect
of
the
climate
change.
Yes,
there
is
an
effect
that
means
changing
the
crop
yields
drastically
so
that
it
gets
minimized.
Then
farming
analysis
and
major
functionality ,
it
is
possible
to
carry
out
and
then
effective
use
of
all
the
inputs
natural,
chemical,
human
resources
this
is
being
done.
So,
if
I
discussed
of
course,
I
will
not
read
all
the
points,
but
you
can
see
here
increases
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
crop
in
all
seasons.
We
need
to
see
that
we
have
the
problem
of
the
water
supply
and
this
I
discussed
earlier
also,
the
world
population
is
expected
to
reach
around
10
billion
by
2050.
So,
in
order
to
feed
the
growing
population,
there
is
a
tremendous
pressure on the land, there is a tremendous pressure on water .
So,
means
the
global
demand
for
the
food
will
increase
by
70%.
So,
this
is
the
very
important
part.
So,
to
grow
large
amount
of
food,
huge
amount
of
food
or
growing
population
we
need
to
reduce
the
water
supply ,
reduce
the
water
losses,
so,
that
the
water
allocated
for
agriculture
can
be
effectively
used.
Now ,
to
do
this,
to
make
the
system
operational,
we
need
IoT
which
will
help.
So,
IoT
involves
tiny
sensors
and
this
tiny
sensors
will
be
monitoring
the
soil
moisture
it
will
monitor
the
humidity .
It
will
monitor
the
pressure
of
light,
solar
radiation
there
are
several
things
which
involve
the
application
of
the
IoT
is
important
IoT
provides
accurate
data
because
it
involves
sensors.
So,
there
is
nothing
like
any
human
by
its
biasness
here.
So,
it
will
give
the
correct
data
which
is
hooked
and
in
your
server
these
data
are
getting
and accordingly the decision can be taken.
Optimal
use
of
the
groundwater
because
less
water
is
being
used,
so
less
water
is
being
used
because
you
are
giving
precise
water .
So,
naturally
there
is
a
saving
in
water
thereby
saving
in the electricity . So, that is the important part.Minimizing
the
adverse
effects
of
the
climate
change,
we
observed
here
there
is
a
global
challenge
due
to
change
in
the
climate,
agriculture
is
going
to
be
the
affected.
So,
if
we
are
saving
water ,
we
are
taking
the
decision
properly
we
will
be
having
the
lesser
effect
of
the
climate
change.
So,
that
is
the
important
component
of
these
things.
So,
there
are
many
potential
adoptions
available
for
that
means
so,
this
is
climate
risk
management
science,
too
has to adapt for the change in the climate change and IoT  has to play a major role.
Another
point
is
farming
analysis
and
major
functionality .
So,
we
are
getting
here
real
time
data,
it
is
not
the
data
which
we
will
be
getting
and
then
after
10
days
after
15
days,
so
the
crop
fails.
So,
real
time
data
are
important
for
application
and
processing
those
data
and
using
those
data
for
irrigation
nutrient
management.
So,
this
is
possible
when
we
are
using
IoT
system or ICT  based systems.
And
then
there
is
a
provision
that
real
time
surveillance
that
the
users
can
watch
anytime
anywhere
through
the
mobile
terminals.
Data
storage,
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
data
which
we
are
getting
continuously
it
is
hooked
with
the
server
and
we
are
getting
we
are
holding
means
getting
the
data
and
then
those
historical
data
are
useful
for
analysis
and
taking
the
intelligent decision.
Effective
use
of
the
natural
resources.
Land
is
getting
degraded
because
of
the
overuse
of
water
and
so
degradation
of
the
land
and
then
deterioration
of
the
quality
of
this
soil
that
is
a
major
challenge.
So
that
it
possible
by
using
the
automation
or
IoT
based
system
precise
application
of
water
at
appropriate
place
precise
application
of
nutrient
at
appropriate
place
and
it
involves
a
minimum
human
intervention
are
biasness
while
taking
the
data,
when
taking the decision.
Scope
automation,
all
the
points
of
course
we
have
discussed
but
let
us
try
to
know
that
we
will
be
getting
I
means
how
to
operate
the
pumping
system,
how
long
it
should
be
operated.
What
is
the
time
of
irrigation,
how
long
the
system
is
to
be
used
for
misting
purpose
particularly
for
plant
propagation
or
creating,
taking
the
crop
inside
the
greenhouse
or
misting
system,
application
of
fertilizer?
Soil
moisture
management,
and
then
heating
and
cooling,
monitoring
the
crop
health
and
the
other
scope
of
automation
is
that
if
any
component
is
goes
out
of
order
so
the
system
will
give
information
via
alarming
system
that
this
component
isout
of
order
and
accordingly
this
malfunctioning
can
be
detected
and
one
can
find
out
information.
The
important
point
here
the
role
of
ICTs
and
IoTs
in
micro
irrigation
systems.
So,
the
information
and
communication
technology
it
involves
wireless
technology ,
it
involves
the
GPS,
it
involves
the
GIS
system.
So,
wireless
means
use
of
wireless
communication
that
eliminates
the
need
of
installation
of
coaxial
cables
that
get
damaged
due
to
movement
of
machinery
due
to
movement
of
vehicle
so
that
gets
damaged.
So
now
wireless
has
got
this
advantages
and
this
is
a
fast
then
it
is
good
fiber
based
system
optical
fiber
based
systems
it
has
been
put
up
and
that
has
made
the
life
easy
for
utilization.
Global
positioning
system,
these
also
provide
the
information
where,
the
person
is
available
where
the
crop
is
being
grown,
and
accordingly
geo
referencing
map
making
and
survey
it
is
possible
to
carry
out
the
work and where is the irrigation is to be given, how much irrigation is to be given.
When
we
are
dividing
the
field
GIS
mapping
the
whole
thing
means
you
have
got
the
data
related
to
land
mapped
digitally
and
then
accordingly
the
information
related
to
soil,
information
related
to
different
layers,
crop
water
requirement,
evapotranspiration
requirement,
the
quality
of
the
soil
all
those
data
it
is
possible
that
layer
can
be
prepared.
So
that helps in decision making.
Computer
control
devices
means
the
automatic
micro
irrigation
systems
are
computer
controlled
standalone
system
that
irrigate
the
farm
land
without
human
intervention
or
human
labor .
The
system
it
has
come
that
do
farming
now
slowly
people
are
talking
about
farming
without
farmers
means
the
technology
it
would
be
there
that
this
technology
where
the
huge
involvement
of
the
hard
working
during
odd
time
during
hot
sun,
during
night
hour
during
extreme cold.
So,
farmers
need
not
visit
that
is
the
advantage
of
these
systems
which
is
coming
up
so,
this
smartphone
mobile
apps
in
agriculture
these
has
become
the
important
for
use
of
mobile
technologies
as
a
tool
of
intervention
in
agriculture
and
becoming
increasing
popular .
So,
this
has
already
the
smartphones
have
entered
and
which
has
got
multidimensional
positive
impact and then that will help in the systemIoT
it
has
got
another
important
thing
that
IoT,
this
automatic
irrigation
system
allow
you
just
to
track
their
irrigation
status,
what
is
the
status?
Whether
there
is
a
deficiency
in
moisture
content
and
if
it
is
there,
then
it
will
start
the
process
and
then
when
adequate
amount
of
moisture
content
it
has
obtained
it
will
by
using
a
single
button
one
can
switch
on
and
switch
off
the
data
using
the
soil
moisture
data,
using
the
weather
data
using
the
crop
data and that this is possible it has got by remote control.
It
can
refer
by
having
system
setting
from
the
room,
from
any
other
place.
One
can
use
smartphone,
laptop
there
and
then
using
the
appropriate
communication
data
control
system
this
is
possible.
Precision
agriculture
is
another
important
thing
that
is
a
farming
activities
such
as
application
of
irrigation
water ,
application
of
pesticide,
this
is
possible.
Smart
schedules,
this
schedule
can
be
made
smart
that
instead
of
giving
full
irrigation
at
one
time
or
full
fertilizer
this
can
be
splitted
in
more
number
of
doses
and
that
can
be
applied
that
is
the
beauty of using the IoT .
It
is
giving
information
which
will
notify
the
information
the
problem
where
there
is
a
technical
problem,
systems
should
be
able
to
detect
abnormalities
in
the
irrigation
flow
or
the
leakage
in
pipe
line,
leakage
from
the
wall
some
particular
wall
is
not
working
such
type
of
notification
it
is
possible
that
on
their
dashboard,
such
information
can
be
retrieved,
it
can
come. Weather data and environmental data analytics it is possible.
Interoperability ,
this
is
given
field
irrigation
systems
should
connect
to
other
smartphone
or
laptops.
The
idea
behind
this
is
connecting
with
means
connectivity
that
farmers
or
growers
should
receive
update
anytime
from
any
available
device.
Not
typical
wheat
and
rice
crop
grower
but
the
farmer
those
who
are
growing
the
high
value
crops
and
they
have
already
started
using
such
information.
Managing
water
expenses,
irrigation
management
control
amount
of
water
used,
amount
of
expenditure
to
be
made
payment
has
to
be
done
for
this
one
that
the
important
part
for
this
one.
Preventing
wastage
of
water
and
lack
of
prompt
monitoring
this
is
the
important
thing
that
is
there.
Efficient
crop
health
is
possible
by
using
the IoT .
Now ,
there
are
different
types
of
micro
irrigation
automation
system,
these
system
can
be
open
or
closed
loop
and
they
can
be
classified
maybe
it
is
a
sequential
or
it
can
be
non-
sequential.
Sequential
means
it
follow
a
specific
pattern
that
say
whole
field
is
divided
into
anumber
of
zones
or
number
of
plots.
So,
it
follows
a
particular
sequence.
So,
field
is
divided
in dif ferent sub unit each plot is irrigated one after other following a particular sequence.
Non
sequential,
sub
units
irrigated
randomly
based
on
the
plant
water
need,
such
system
is
operated
electrically
with
or
without
using
the
program.
Possibility
of
utilizing
feedback
information
from
the
field
for
a
remote
control.
So,
here
means
the
sequential
operation
or
non-sequential
operation
it
is
suppose
same
crop
is
grown,
and
soil
is
same
then
it
can
have
a
sequential.
But
it
is
a
different,
it
is
a
large
area
soil
has
got
different
new
texture,
there
are
different
crops
and
then
each
crop
has
got
its
own
economic
value.
So,
this
can
be
prioritize
and then it can be done in particular following a particular sequence.
So,
sequential
system
can
be
classified
as
a
hydraulically
based,
electrically
based
or
combination
of
both.
Non
sequential
means,
I
will
discuss
more
about
this
part
and
then
non
sequential
feedback
control
inferential
control
means
it
will
get
information
by
taking
the
data
from
the
field
by
say
let
us
say
if
soil
moisture
content
after
and
then
the
data
means
processing
it
done
or
taking
inferences
from
the
weather
data
this
kind
of
a
thing
and
combination of both it can be done.
So,
sequential
system
it
can
be
hydraulically
operated
automated
irrigation
system,
so
at
each
connection
to
the
main
line
unit
has
the
water
metering
valve
and
hydraulic
valve.
Here
the
amount
of
water
is
fixed
according
to
the
crop
and
crop
need
and
then
the
soil
information
according
to
the
climatic
conditions.
So,
soil
and
climatic
data
are
used
to
find
out
the
whether
there
is
a
requirement
for
the
crop
and
then
how
much
is
the
amount
should
be
given.
Now ,
these
systems
are
suitable
for
greenhouses,
gardens,
and
nursery
means
irrigation
of greenhouses, the gardens and nursery .
Now ,
this
particular
thing
which
is
see
sequential
and
non
sequential
type
of
automation
what
it
showed
that
we
developed
a
program
the
name
of
the
program
was
Varun
and
then
the
automated
irrigation
system
which
we
developed
this
particular
this
is
the
one
Menu
of
the
program
which
is
shown
here
the
total
field
is
divided
into
the
eight
plots
and
then
plot
1
plot
2 plot 3 plot 4 this is in the sequence it is given.
Now ,
this
means
when
we
have
put
up
a
plot
that
plot
1
should
be
given
irrigation
then
all
the
valves
which
are
they
are
closed
in
other
places
and
it
will
be
given
the
irrigation
will
bemeans
solenoid
valve
will
be
open
for
the
plot
1
and
then
irrigation
will
commence,
then
it
will
come
to
in
case
of
sequential
this
particular
after
the
given
amount
of
water
it
may
be
the
timing
base
it
may
be
that
the
soil
moisture
base
or
volume
of
water
base
then
after
the
desired amount of water has been supplied this particular solenoid valve will be closed.
And
if
it
is
a
sequential
it
will
come
to
the
plot
2
then
it
will
take
the
plot
3
and
all
other
solenoid
valves
will
be
closed,
but
if
it
is
a
non
sequential
thing
then
depending
on
the
value
of
the
crop,
depending
on
suppose
here
8
plots
it
has
got
different
soil
and
texture
maybe
soil
in
the
plot
6
the
water
content
mean
soil
moisture
is
depleted
fast
because
it
has
got
coarse
textures
soil
then
irrigation
should
be
given
to
plot
6
and
then
it
will
go
to
the
another
one.
So, this could follow a particular manner .
Electrically
operated
based
system,
the
system
operates
remotely
placed
solenoid
valves
in
sequence.
Water
supply
is
regulated
using
timer
clock
to
different
plots.
Timer
clock
is
a
program
to
start
and
a
stop
means
here
the
time
is
fixed
and
then
it
will
operate
like
this
it
operates
on
different
way
fuzzy
logic
technique
has
been
also
used
in
some
of
the
normal
operations
you
may
find
in
the
washing
machine
as
well
there
are
many
places
you
find
that
there
is
a
timer ,
a
clock
or
timer
will
operate
for
a
given
time
and
then
it
will
switch
on.
So,
it
will
just
start
and
stop
as
per
the
time
we
are
setting
it.
So,
controllers
are
designed
with
calendar
based
programs
so
that
the
watering
cycle
can
be
automatically
started
on
a
desired
day of the week. Such systems are used for irrigation of gardens agricultural fields.
Non
sequential,
it
can
be
feedback
that
is
soil
moisture
based
mean
soil
moisture
it
means
where
it
involves
soil
moisture
sensor ,
it
involves
control
unit
that
is
a
microprocessor
or
solenoid
valves.
So
that
the
whole
for
me
divided
into
number
of
sub
units.
Each
subunit
has
one
soil
moisture
sensor ,
sensors
are
connected
to
the
CCU
that
is
central
control
unit,
CCU
could
be
a
microprocessor
or
computer
with
a
given
device
driver
program
or
algorithm
and
it will switch on depending on the algorithm that we have developed.
This
is
the
layout
of
this
one
that
you
can
see
here
the
whole
field
is
divided
into
the
number
of
units
and
each
unit
is
provided
with
the
soil
moisture
sensor
and
then
the
data
here
there
is
a
interfacing
unit
and
there
is
a
personal
computer
so,
that
the
information
which
we
are
getting
field
from
the
field
from
the
sensor ,
each
field
it
comes
to
the
information
unit
it
passes on to the server or a computer microprocessor and then that data it is stored.And
then
the
device
to
program
it
search
the
data
and
accordingly
depending
on
the
soil
moisture
content.
The
solenoid
valve
provided
at
each
plot
it
opens
and
then
it
commences
the
irrigation
and
it
will
switch
off
then
it
will
go
to
the
next
plot
as
per
the
program
which
we are developed.
So,
inferential
control
it
uses
the
evapotranspiration
data
models
and
estimates
the
ET
value
means
that
is
how
then
it
calculates.
So,
estimated
evapotranspiration
is
used
to
schedule
irrigation
that
this
is
the
amount
of
water
it
should
be
given
to
each
plot
accordingly
these
things.
There
are
different
parameters
which
are
used
while
we
are
automating
the
system,
so,
these
parameters
are
the
evaluating
the
water
quality
prior
to
irrigation,
what
is
the
type
of
crop
and
then
the
what
is
the
level
of
crop
means,
whether
it
is
initially
stage,
the
maturity
stage,
development
stage
then
the
data
which
are
required
at
the
temperature
solar
radiation
means
which
is
weather
data,
soil
data
weather
prediction
models
are
used
and
they
are
being
used
for controlling the irrigation system.
So, we discussed these points and then these topics you can use these books as a references.
So,
in
this
particular
topic
we
discussed
the
importance
of
MI
automation,
we
discussed
about
the
role
of
information
communication
information
system
and
communication
technology .
We
discussed
about
Internet
of
Things
in
micro
irrigation
automation,
different
types
of
micro
irrigation
systems,
automation
systems
and
then
the
parameters
which
are
used
for
automation.
In
forthcoming
lecture
part
2
we
will
be
discussing
about
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system
mainly
sensors
which
are
used.
So,
this
we
will
discuss
in
the
forthcoming
lecture. Thank you very much.
