Economic Analysis of Micr o Irrigation System (Part – 1)
Hello
participants,
I
invite
you
to
the
lecture
55
of
micro
irrigation
engineering
subject,
this
lecture
55
is
on
economic
analysis
of
micro
irrigation
system
part
1.
In
previous
lectures
we
discussed
about
theoretical
aspects
of
micro
irrigation
system,
we
discussed
about
different
components,
we
discussed
about
the
basic
hydraulics
of
micro
irrigation
system
and
its
design
and
also
we
discussed
on
how
the
water
is
moving
through
a
drip
emitter
and
to
model
micro
irrigation system or dripper .
One
of
the
most
important
thing
when
we
are
designing
the
system
we
take
care
about
how
much
is
the
energy,
how
it
should
be
efficient
hydraulically
efficient
system,
but
at
the
same
time
to
adopt
the
system
in
the
field,
economics
of
the
micro
irrigation
system
or
any
system
in
that
matter ,
it
is
important
that
whether
it
is
economically
viable.
On
the
economics
aspect,
we
are
going to discuss the basic terminologies which are related to economic evaluation.
So,
what
are
the
different
types
of
cost,
what
is
the
meaning
of
supply
and
demand,
and
how
to
evaluate,
make
the
benefit
cost
analysis
of
the
system.
So,
these
are
some
terminologies
which
will
be
dealt
in
this
particular
lecture.
I
told
you
that
planning
of
any
irrigation
system
or
for
that
matter
any
system
when
we
are
talking
it
should
be
economically
and
financially
feasible.
And
this
evolution
means
financial
as
well
as
economic
evolution
is
important
to
make
it
acceptable
by the society , by the market.
So,
economic
feasibility
evaluation
it
assesses
the
economic
viability
of
the
planned
development
and
as
it
assists
in
selecting
the
farm
irrigation
system
among
various
alternatives,
while
financial
feasibility
evaluation
assesses
the
financial
condition
and
that
will
be
encountered
in
developing
and
operating
the
irrigation
farms
that
whether
this
particular
alternative
will
bethe
solution.
Now ,
important
part
of
the
irrigation
system
is
determining
the
expected
annual
cost
of
owning
and
operating
each
feasible
alternative
designs.
So,
there
could
be
different
plants,
there
could
be
different
designs
and
then
one
should
check
which
design
or
which
particular
option is feasible.
So,
there
are
some
agencies
from
which
the
financing
is
being
given,
maybe
the
finance
is
given
by
the
government
of
India
or
state
government
or
there
are
financial
agencies
like
banks.
So,
they
evaluate
the
soundness
or
whether
the
project
which
has
been
prepared
it
is
sound
enough
and
then
the
particular
borrower
will
be
able
to
repay
the
loan
if
he
gets
the
finance
from
the
funding agency .
So,
a
term
called
when
we
are
talking
about
the
cost,
so
there
are
different
types
of
cost
one
is
variable
cost
and
other
one
is
the
fixed
cost.
So,
means
the
total
cost
when
we
say
it
is
the
sum
of
these
2
costs
and
when
you
look
the
diagram
here
it
say
some
particular
output
are
produced,
which
has
come
to
the
market
and
then
it
has
been
given
the
cost
then
what
is
the
total
cost
it
involves.
So,
that
particular
product
we
are
putting
then
what
is
the
variable
cost
and
what
is
the
fixed
costs.
Fixed
cost
is
constant
means
it
is
fixed
and
but
when
we
are
making
the
total
cost,
so,
sum
of
these
2
costs
when
we
are
making
it,
this
plus
this
you
can
see,
so,
this
green
line
it
is
the
total
cost
or
I
am
putting
it
say
at
one
this
at
some
particular
cost
it
is
there
and
then
this
some
value
it
is
given
for
the
fixed
cost
and
then
some
of
these
2
is
giving
this
value.
So,
this
is
the
way
so
what
is
the
fixed
cost?
Fixed
cost
are
also
known
as
annual
ownership
cost,
they
are
generally
independent
of
level
of
supply
use.
It
includes
annual
depreciation,
it
includes
the
interest,
and
it
includes the yearly expenditure, including taxes and insurance etcetera.
So,
depreciation
is
the
other
part
which
is
to
be
accounted.
So,
what
is
the
meaning
of
depreciation?
Depreciation
means
to
distribute
the
cost
of
a
given
component
over
an
expected
life.
So,
each
system,
each
component
it
has
got
expected
life
and
that
has
to
be
taken
intoconsideration
while
we
are
selecting
the
annual
cost.
So,
useful
life
for
some
of
the
components
of
irrigation
system
we
can
see
because
if
we
are
taking
water
from
the
well.
So,
here
it
is
say
wells and casing.
So,
depreciation
means
life
of
wells
and
casing,
it
is
between
20
to
30
years
and
then
annual
maintenance
and
repairs
it
is
in
percentage
at
0.5
to
1.5%
of
the
initial
cost
which
is
there.
So,
that
is
taken
care.
Similarly ,
these
are
other
components
say
pumping
plant
structure,
pump,
and
vertical
turbine
pump.
So,
it
has
got
some
certain
components
under
the
pump
that
could
be
column, there are bowls and it has got a specific values.
These
values
are
not
exactly
what
is
the
prevailing
market
values
but
some
value
they
are
given
for
example
it
is
given
because
this
value
is
changing,
the
cost
is
always
escalating
and
then
it
has
got
expected
period
of
life.
So,
they
are
to
be
included
and
then
this
is
the
percentage
of
the
initial
cost,
this
is
the
value
for
the
annual
maintenance.
So,
this
is
5
to
7%
so,
bowls
and
then
columns
etc.
So,
each
has
got
it
then
centrifugal
pump,
power
transmission
and
gear
head
here
V-belt.
So,
like
this
for
each
these
are
the
components
and
these
components
are
it
has
got
its
own life and accordingly the annual cost is estimated.
Similarly ,
there
are
other
components,
these
are
the
pipes.
So,
these
pipes
could
be
made
up
of
different
material
PVC,
HDPE
and
it
has
got
its
own
life
and
then
what
are
the
annual
cost
maintenance.
So,
it
comes
to
the
0.25
-
2.75%
of
the
initial
cost.
So,
aluminum
pipes
are
of
different
material
and
it
has
got
its
own
life.
Plastic
pipe,
plastic
trickle,
surface
means
it
is
this
irrigation
that
is
a
10
years
it
has
been
reported
and
then
this
sprinkler
heads,
the
drip
emitters,
the trickle filters so, it has got also and then considerable amount it goes for of the initial cost.
Then
the
reservoirs,
then
the
mechanical
move
sprinkler
system,
continuously
sprinkler
system,
and
prime
mover .
So,
each
of
these
it
has
got
its
own
and
then
these
costs
are
taken
or
taken
means
considering
the
1980
price.
So,
you
can
understand
this
much
of
depreciation
has
to
be
aided
whereas
the
life
of
the
system
we
will
remain
same
and
then
approximately
when
we
arecomputing
then
one
can
take
the
values
of
the
annual
maintenance
and
repair
costs.
So,
much
of
the percentage of the initial cost.
Interest
cost
which
when
we
were
talking
about
finding
of
the
annual
costs
are
taking
the
depreciation.
Now ,
interest
is
the
return
from
productivity
invested
capital.
So,
when
money
is
borrowed
to
the
finance
for
initial
cost
of
the
irrigation
system.
Interest
is
money
paid
for
the
use
of
borrowed
money .
So,
particularly
for
agriculture
purpose,
the
interest
rate
is
low
as
compared
to other commodity or other industries.
So,
Government
of
India
is
giving
priority
and
banks
are
giving
priority
for
the
irrigation
system.
We
will
discuss
when
we
will
come
about
the
particular
micro
irrigation
promotion,
government
of
India
is
giving
50%
of
the
cost
for
this
so,
here
interest
if
50%
money
it
is
taken
from
the
bank
accordingly
the
bank
also
charge
interest.
For
agriculture
purpose
the
interest
rate
is
generally
low.
So,
variable
cost,
these
costs
are
those
which
vary
as
the
total
cost
to
the
farmer
means
grower .
When
the
output
for
agriculture
person
and
production
it
varies
impact
variable
cost
will
vary
in
exactly
the
same
proportion
as
the
output.
And
these
include
the
cost
of
labour ,
electricity
charges
and
there
are
other
expenses
which
are
taken
in
the
variable
cost.
Marginal
cost
is
another
terminology
which
is
used
marginal
cost
is
increase
in
variable
costs
associated
with
the
unit
increase
in
the
cost
of
production.
So,
that
becomes
the
unit
increase
in
the
production
then
marginal cost also is associated with that.
Marginal
cost
is
given
by
change
in
the
total
cost
divided
by
change
in
the
quantity
of
goods
produced.
𝑀𝐶= ∆𝑇𝐶∆𝑄=∆𝑉𝐶∆𝑄
So,
this
ratio
gives
the
marginal
cost
which
can
be
also
given
as
a
change
in
the
variable
cost
divided
by
change
in
the
total
quantity
of
goods
produced.
And
this
is
our
discrete
charge
of
the
total
quantity
produced
and
for
infinitesimal
change
of
Q
it
can
be
given
by
marginal
cost
can
begiven
as
the
change
in
the
total
cost
to
that
change
in
the
total
quantity
of
goods
produced
so,
this
way it is.
𝑀𝐶= δ𝑇𝐶δ𝑄=δ𝑉𝐶δ𝑄
Where,
MC = Mar ginal cost
Q     = the total quantity of goods produced
VC = Variable cost
TC = Total cost
Then
from
there
we
are
getting
average
cost,
the
average
cost
is
the
cost
associated
to
each
unit
of production that how much it costs the average to produce one unit of output.
Now ,
total
production
cost
can
be
shown
here
and
you
can
see
here
a
diagram
has
been
plotted
particularly
means
taken
as
an
example
for
the
maize
production
and
when
the
input
fertilizer
or
nutrient
it
has
been
aided.
So,
what
we
see
in
the
first
stage?
In
the
first
stage,
we
see
there
is
an
exponential
increase
in
the
production
means
as
we
keep
on
increasing
the
quantity
of
input
fertilizer , the produce is also increasing.
But
the
rate
of
increase,
if
you
see
the
slope
of
this
curve,
the
slope
of
curve
you
may
find
that
it
is
very
steep.
Whereas,
in
this
case
the
slope
it
slowly
it
is
there
is
an
increase
but
the
rate
of
increase
is
lesser
than
as
compared
to
the
phase
1,
but
when
we
come
to
the
third
stage
it
has
come
almost
to
the
stable
and
no
further
in
case
if
you
further
increase
the
quantity
of
input
fertilizer
then
the
yield
decreases.
So,
output
decreases
when
the
further
increase
in
the
input
that
is your fertilizer is given.
Now ,
this
can
be
illustrated
by
the
law
of
marginal
return.
So,
this
is
given
means
the
law
of
diminishing
marginal
return
given
the
fixed
factors
production
cannot
increase
indefinitely
until
other
factors
also
increase
or
decrease.
So,
that
is
an
important
part
to
be
considered,
when
we
are
considering
the
total
cost
of
production.
Supply
and
demand
this
is
a
very
important
from
themarketing
point
of
view
that
how
the
supply
and
demand
of
the
commodity
it
is
changing
the
price.
So,
supply
what
is
the
supply?
Supply
is
the
quantity
of
a
commodity
that
sellers
are
able
and
willing
to
offer
for
sale
at
different
prices
per
unit
of
time,
this
is
the
important
terminology
and
law
of
supply
states
that
quantity
of
goods
offered
or
willing
to
offer
by
producer
or
owner
for
sale,
it
increases
with
increase
in
the
market
price
of
the
good
and
falls
if
vice
versa,
in
the
supply
it
is
decreased
then
you
may
find
that
means
the
price
it
is
falls
then
supply
also
decreases.
So,
all
other
things
remaining
unchanged
provided
all
other
things
are
unchanged.
So,
supply
is
a
function
of
we
can
say
the
price
means
the
price
of
related
goods
and
then
the
number
of
producers.
So,
supply
it
is
a
function
of
the
price
of
the
item,
then
price
of
related
similar
goods and then the number of producers.
Now ,
this
is
the
diagram
you
can
see
here,
when
you
are
seeing
the
trend
is
almost
same,
trend
is
same
means
when
supply
is
being
given
you
are
seeing
that
at
the
quantity
it
is
increasing,
this
is
the
case
when
we
are
seeing
that
when
the
quantity
is
increasing
the
prices
increasing
means
the
quantity
increasing
at
the
price
is
increasing
when
only
one
is
there
and
then
when
you
see
here,
it is the example it is given.
That
a
case
of
a
soybean
for
example,
that
say
that
is
some
new
soybean
farmer
enter
the
market
clearing
after
one
you
see
that
he
gets
the
good
price.
So,
he
increase
the
area
under
cultivation
and
then
he
gets
the
price
it
happens,
but
what
happened?
More
soybean
when
it
is
being
produced
its
price
remain
the
same
meaning
that
the
supply
curve
itself
shifts
to
this
part
means
the supply has increased, but the price, he will not going to get the price.
So,
in
other
words
supply
will
increase,
but
the
price
he
will
not
going
to
get
the
same
price
though
so,
other
factor
can
shift
the
supply
curve
as
well,
what
we
see?
Change
in
the
price
of
production,
if
the
change
in
the
price
of
production
if
the
drought
occurs
let
us
say
when
there
is
a
water
scarcity
particularly
when
there
is
drought
case.
So,
then
price
of
the
same
commodity
it
increases,
so
that
it
becomes
the
same
but
trend
of
the
curve
when
you
see
whether
it
is
S1
or
S2or
S3
is
same.
But
the
curve
changes
its
position
depending
on
the
market
prevailing
price
and
the market or other climatic factor and other prevailing factor it happens.
Demand
is
the
other
term
which
is
used
in
this
economic
analysis.
So,
demand
is
the
desire
to
possess
and
willingness
and
ability
to
pay
particular
goods.
It
is
an
effectiveness
of
the
desire
which
explains
ability
and
willingness
to
pay
for
a
particular
commodity .
Law
of
demand
states
that
as
the
price
increases
the
consumer
buyer
will
buy
less
of
a
particular
commodity
or
and
vice
versa.
So,
major
characteristics
of
demand
are
ability
and
willingness
to
pay
for
a
particular
commodity by the user .
The
demand
is
always
at
a
given
price.
These
are
the
major
characteristics
of
the
demand
ability
and
willingness
to
pay.
Second
thing
is
demand
is
always
at
a
given
price
and
demand
is
always
per
unit
of
time.
So,
it
is
also
a
function
of
time.
Now ,
you
can
see
here
the
curve
is
plotted,
here
there
is
a
quantity
means
this
is
produce,
which
are
in
the
number
and
this
is
the
price.
So,
price
when
the
price
falls,
say
this
is
the
case
P1,
and
so
P1
at
this
particular
quantity
Q1
and
then
what
you
find
that
this
is
the
point
at
which
it
is
intersecting,
but
when
the
price
falls
or
same
quantity
it
is
coming
this
is
your,
this
particular
value.
So,
P1
to
P2
the
quantity
demanded
increase
from
Q1
to
Q2.
So,
that
means
your
part
of
the
same
product
but
the
demand
has
increased.
So,
this
is
a
negative
relation
between
price
and
quantity
hence,
the
negative
slope
of
the
demand
a
schedule
that
a
demand
schedule
this
is
the
understanding
about
how
the
demand
with
the
price
it is varying with the change in the quantity and price of the product.
Benefit
cost
analysis
or
cost
benefit
analysis.
It
provide
the
systematic
set
of
procedure
by
which
any
industry
or
owner
can
assess
whether
to
take
a
project
or
an
irrigation
system
or
any
cropping
pattern
or
any
technology
when
there
is
a
choice
between
mutually
exclusive
projects
or
program
or
crop
means,
whether
we
are
getting
benefit
whatever
investment
we
make.
So,
cost
benefit
analysis
is
used
to
assess
the
value
for
money
of
large
projects
or
adoption
of
new
technology in agriculture or changing cropping pattern.So,
this
is
a
very
important
thing
when
the
technologies
are
coming
up
when
need
to
know
say
we
are
talking
about
precision
agriculture,
we
are
talking
about
the
application
of
drones
and
then
application
of
fertilizer
at
a
particular
but
whether
we
are
getting
benefit
out
of
that,
but
how
much
benefit,
how
much
it
is
a
cost
effective,
those
are
to
be
analyzed.
So,
net
present
value
expresses
the
difference
between
the
discounted
present
values
of
future
benefits
and
then
discounted present value of future costs.
So, NPV  is given by
NPV  = PV  (Benefits) – PV  (costs).
PV
is
the
present
value
that
benefit
minus
the
cost,
since
PV
minus
means
your
present
value,
present
cost
and
present
how
much
benefit.
That
will
be
the
net
present
value
and
the
formula
to
calculate
the
present
value
for
a
given
future
value.
And
the
given
interest
rate
can
be
estimated
by using this expression
𝑃𝑉= 𝐹𝑉
1+𝑖()𝑛
Where
the
future
value
divided
by
one
plus
interest
rate
to
the
power
number
of
years
or
what
is
the
period.
So,
for
a
given
period
PV
can
be
present
value
can
be
estimated.
Now ,
there
is
a
decision
rule
that
net
present
value
means
your
decision
rule
whether
to
accept
or
reject,
if
NPV
is
greater
than
0,
we
will
accept,
if
it
is
less
than
0
means
we
are
in
loss
and
we
will
not
accept
or
we will reject.
So, benefit cost ratio is given by the term
𝐵𝐶𝑅= 𝑃𝑉 (𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑠)𝑃𝑉 (𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠)
That
is
the
benefit
divided
by
the
cost
means
present
value
benefit
and
present
cost.
So,
denominator
of
the
benefit
cost
ratio.
So,
the
present
value
of
all
the
project
cost
not
just
per
capital
cost.
So,
decision
rule
here
if
BCR
that
is
benefit
cost
ratio
is
greater
than
1,
it
is
to
be
accepted,
if
it
is
less
than
1
that
project
needs
to
be
rejected.
Now ,
it
should
be
clear
that
whennet
present
value
is
greater
than
0,
then
BCR
will
be
greater
than
1,
if
it
is
less
NPV
is
less
than
0, then it is going to be means benefit cost ratio is less than 1.
Internal
rate
of
return,
this
is
another
important
terminology .
So,
this
is
the
given
interest
rate
at
which
the
net
present
value
of
the
project
equals
to
0.
So,
when
IRR
is
greater
than
the
rate
of
interest
means
your
internal
rate
of
return
is
greater
than
the
interest
someone
is
paying,
then
only
it
is
to
be
accepted
otherwise
not.
Payback
period,
initial
investment
divided
by
the
net
cash
inflow
value,
so,
this
is
estimated
once
one
can
decide
in
favor
of
the
project
with
shorter
payback period decision can be taken solely based on the payback period criteria.
Break-Even
analysis,
this
is
another
important
terminology ,
an
important
aspect
when
we
are
evaluating
the
project
when
we
are
in
a
spending
in
the
project.
So,
Break-Even
is
used
to
give
answer
that
what
is
the
minimum
level
of
sales
that
ensures
the
company
will
not
experience
loss,
or
how
much
sell
can
decreased
so
that
company
is
still
continues
to
get
profit.
So,
this
analysis
of
the
level
of
sale
at
which
the
company
or
project
would
make
zero
profit
as
its
name
implies this approach determines the sales need to Break-Even.
Now ,
you
can
see
here
this
particular
diagram.
So,
this
diagram
it
is
plotted
between
the
outputs
and
with
cost.
So,
there
are
2
costs
you
can
see
here
fixed
costs
and
other
one
is
the
variable
cost
and
then
the
some
of
these
2
costs.
Some
of
these
to
cast
means
your
fixed
cost,
variable
cost.
So,
there
is
a
linear
relationship
and
then
there
is
a
linear
relationship
with
the
output
and
income.
Now ,
here
the
description
I
can
say
the
line
OA
is
the
variation
of
the
income
at
varying
level
of
the
production
activity
and
OB
is
the
total
fixed
cost
in
the
business.
So,
as
output
increases
the
variable
cost
means
it
also
increases,
total
cost
will
also
means
when
output
we
are
increasing
the
total
cost
will
increase
and
mainly
the
variable
cost
will
also
increase.
So,
at
low
level
of
output costs are greater than income.At
the
point
of
intersection
means,
this
is
the
point
where
we
can
say
that
the
point
of
intersection
that
this
is
the
point
P,
the
costs
are
equal
means
this
cost
is
equal
to
the
income
whatever
the
cost
means,
your
income
is
as
well
as
profit
we
can
say
this
is
at
this
point
it
is
equal.
So,
this
is
your
Break-Even
point
if
this
cost
is
less
than
means,
then
it
is
a
loss
and
when
the
profit
will
be
there.
So,
this
cost
is
more
than
the
total
cost
is
your
total
income
is
more
than
the
cost
involved
that
fixed
cost
plus
variable
cost.
So,
this
particular
value
we
can
say
when
let
us
say
at
this
particular
point,
so,
this
is
the
cost
involved
and
then
above
this
is
the
profit.
So,
this
income
can
be
taken
means
total
income
minus
total
cost
involved
that
will
give
us
the
profit
and that is what the important. Break-Even point can be computed by using the relationship
𝐵𝐸𝑃= 𝑇𝐹𝐶𝑆𝑃−𝑉𝐶𝑃()
Where,
BEP = Breakeven point (units of production)
TFC = Total fixed costs
VCP  = Variable costs per unit of production
SP = Selling price per unit of production
So,
this
way,
we
have
a
studied
different
terminologies.
For
more
detail,
you
may
go
through
these
references
for
more
study .
So,
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
have
studied
the
total
cost
including
variable
as
well
as
fixed
costs.
We
also
try
to
learn
supply
demand
concept,
we
also
try
to
learn
the
breakeven
point
analysis
and
cost
benefit
analysis.
So,
this
we
discussed
and
then
further
on
this
topic
we
will
discuss
in
the
forthcoming
lecture
in
your
lecture
56.
Thank
you
very much.
