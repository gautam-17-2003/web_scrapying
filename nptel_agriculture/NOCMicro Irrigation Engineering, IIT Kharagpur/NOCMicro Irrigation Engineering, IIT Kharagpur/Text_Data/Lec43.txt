Tutorial 8 - Numerical Examples on Sprinkler  Irrigation System
Hello,
participants.
Now ,
I
am
starting
a
new
lecture.
This
Lecture
43
is
on
tutorial
problems.
A
tutorial
is
on
the
topic
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
where
we
have
solved
some
numerical
problems.
This
will
give
you
working
experience
on
how
to
deal
with
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
When
one
wants
to
design
the
system
or
one
wants
to
layout
the
system.
So,
here
you
are given solved examples on the sprinkler irrigation system.
So,
the
first
problem,
it
is
given
here.
We
are
required
to
determine
sprinkler
irrigation
system
capacity
to
irrigate
10
hectare
area
of
maize
crop.
The
design
moisture
use
rate
is
5
millimeter
per
day.
So,
this
is
the
water
which
is
being
withdrawn
from
the
soil
by
the
crop
which
is
5
millimeter
per
day.
The
field
capacity
of
the
soil
is
18%,
permanent
wilting
point
is
12%.
So,
soil,
these
2
constants
are
available
to
us.
We
are
given
bulk
density
of
1.6
gram
per
cc.
Root
zone
depth
is
60
centimeter .
This
is
another
depth
data
available
to
us.
Irrigation
efficiency
of
the
system
is
70%
and
irrigation
is
given
12
days
interval
in
a
period
of
10
days.
The sprinkler system is operated 12 hours per day . So, we are given these data.
Now ,
these
data
are
kept
in
a
symbolic
form.
Means,
A
is
the
area
in
10
hectare.
Moisture
content
at
the
field
capacity
is
18%.
Moisture
content
theta
pw
is
12
percent.
Depth
of
root
zone
is
60
centimeter .
Consumptive
use
rate
that
is
moisture
use
rate
is
5
millimeter
per
day.
Irrigation
efficiency
of
the
system
is
70%
and
the
bulk
density
of
the
soil
is
1.6
gram
per
cc.
10
days
is
the
period
means
in
10
days
the
irrigation
is
to
be
given
and
that
is
the
operating
hours of the pump or sprinkler system is 20 hours.
So, irrigation depth can be found out by using this data.
𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ(𝑑)=(θ𝑓𝑐−θ𝑝𝑤)×ρ𝑏×𝑑𝑟𝑧
That
is
the
moisture
means
available
moisture
content
which
is
the
difference
in
the
moisture
content that is theta fc minus theta pw multiplied by the bulk density into depth of root zone.𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑡ℎ𝑑()=18−12()×1.65×0.6=5.94 𝑐𝑚 
So,
after
substituting
these
values,
we
get
depth
of
root
zone
at
5.94
centimeter .
So,
this
is
the
depth
of
irrigation
which
will
be
used
in
the
problem.
So,
system
capacity
if
we
are
expressing in liter per second,
𝑄=2780𝐴×𝑑𝐹×𝐻×𝐸
Where
the
area
is
given
as
10
hectare.
d
is
the
depth
of
water
to
be
given
in
5.94
centimeter
and
this
F
is
10
days.
H
is
20
hours
and
then
E
is
70
percent.
So,
this
is
in
percentage
so
this
will
be
used
as
such.
So,
we
are
getting
this
value
as
11.80.
If
the
system
capacity
means
our
pump
should
be
of
this
capacity
to
irrigate
the
whole
crop.
This
is
the
solution
to
that
particular problem.
Now ,
we
want
to
work
out
second
problem.
Here
we
are
given
means
we
are
given
the
diameter
of
nozzles
of
a
sprinkler ,
so,
3
millimeter
and
2.5
millimeter .
Mean,
this
is
a
twin
nozzle
system
and
this
sprinkler
head
or
nozzle
is
operating
at
2
kg
per
square
centimeter
pressure.
And
then
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge
is
0.96
for
the
range
nozzle
and
then
0.94
for
the spreader nozzle. So, Cd is known to us.
So,
once
again
this
data
I
am
reading
here,
d1
3
millimeter ,
d2
2.5
millimeter
and
this
is
operating
pressure
is
2
kg
per
square
centimeter
which
is
equivalent
to
20
meter
of
water
column.
That
is
20
means
your
h
and
the
coefficient
of
dischar ge
is
known
to
us
0.96
and
Cd2
is
0.94.
So,
area
of
the
range
nozzle,
by
substituting
the
value
of
d1
that
is
3
millimeter .
So, if we are expressing in meter , so, this become 0.003.
And then, we get the value of area of the range nozzle is
𝑎1=π4×(𝑑1)2=π4×(0.003)2=7.07 ×10−6𝑚2
So,
this
is
the
area
of
this
first
nozzle.
Then,
second
nozzle
which
is
of
2.5
millimeter
in
size.
And then, the area will be
𝑎2=π4×(𝑑2)2=π4×(0.025)2=4.9 ×10−6𝑚2In
the
same
way,
it
is
calculated.
So,
having
got
this
area,
we
will
be
just
simply
substituting
the values of a1, a2 and Cd1, Cd2 in this expression.
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 𝑞()=𝐶𝑑1×𝑎1×2×𝑔×ℎ
(
)+𝐶𝑑2×𝑎2×2×𝑔×ℎ
(
)
So, dischar ge q in cubic meter can be written as
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒 𝑞()=
0.96×7.07 ×10−6×2×9.81×20
(
)+0.94×4.9 ×10−6×2×9.81×20
(
)
=2.25×10−4𝑚3𝑠−1
So,
after
substituting
these
values,
we
get
the
total
dischar ge.
So,
if
there
are
say
similar
sprinklers
and
are
attached
in
so
many
means
10
numbers,
15
numbers,
25
number
so,
we
will
get
a
total
dischar ge.
Now ,
this
total
dischar ge
from
all
the
sprinklers
will
be
used
to
find
out
the
dischar ge
from
a
lateral.
Or,
if
these
are
the
so
many
number
of
laterals,
so
many
number ,
so
much
of
the
dischar ge
which
is
required
then
we
will
use
this
value
to
find
out
a
system capacity .
Now ,
this
is
the
Question
3.
In
Question
3,
we
have
been
given
data
that
a
spacing
of
the
sprinkler
along
the
main
mean
this
there
is
a
main
pipeline,
this
is
your
lateral
pipeline.
Now ,
the
spacing
of
the
lateral,
a
spacing
of
the
sprinkler ,
so,
this
is
one
is
sprinkler .
This
is
another
sprinkler .
It
is
given
as,
so,
this
is
your
main
pipeline.
This
is
a
lateral
pipeline.
So,
we
are
putting
here
it
is
as
Lm
and
this
is
Ls.
Say
this
is
at
another
sprinkler
which
is
at
12
meter .
So,
this
spacing
is
along
the
lateral.
So,
here,
it
is
given
this
is
18
meter .
This
is
12
meter ,
Ls.
So,
18
meter
and
this
is
a
main
pipeline.
So,
here,
the
spacing
along
the
main
is
18
meter
and
12
meter
used
to
irrigate
a
crop
which
is
grown
on
a
sandy
soil
and
the
slope
is
3%.
The
maximum allowable application rate is 3.75 centimeter per hour .
So,
slope
is
known
to
us,
sandy
soil
is
given
to
us.
So,
from
the
table,
from
the
data
available
we
will
choose,
what
is
the
maximum
application
rate?
So,
this
information
is
given
to
us.
That
is
3.75
centimeter
per
hour.
Now ,
another
information
is
given,
there
are
20
sprinklers
which
are
used.
So,
there
could
be
you
know
I
can
say
here
say
there
are
10
sprinkler
in
this
lateral. There are 10 sprinklers in this lateral.So,
total
sprinkler ,
number
of
sprinkler
will
be
20.
Now ,
if
I
have
to
use
this
particular
main
pipeline
so,
what
will
be
the
total
dischar ge
that
will
be
carried
by
the
main
and
this
main
will
be receiving water from the pump. So, this way will be calculating.
So,
we
are
given
information.
So,
Sl
that
is
the
spacing
along
the
lateral
of
means
spacing
of
the
sprinkler
along
the
lateral
is
12
meter .
Sm
is
18
meter .
Application
rate
I
is
3.75
centimeter
per
hour
or
37.5
millimeter
per
hour.
This
can
be
written.
And
this
is
just
a
simple
formula. We can write here.
𝑞=𝑆𝑙×𝑆𝑚×𝐼
3600
So,
if
I
substitute
the
value,
we
will
get
dischar ge
from
a
single
sprinkler
nozzle.
So,
I
am
substituting
the
value
and
I
am
getting
the
dischar ge
from
a
single
sprinkler
nozzle
is
2.25
liter
per
second.
So,
this
total
system
capacity
will
be
N
into
q.
So,
this
is
a
20
multiplied
by
2.25.
So,
system
capacity
it
becomes
45
liter
per
second.
Now ,
this
is
a
capacity
which
is
used
for
the
pump
to
decide
that
my
pump
should
be
able
to
deliver
this
much
of
dischar ge.
So,
accordingly ,
we
will
choose
the
pump
dischar ge
which
will
be
used
and
then
pump
also
needs
how
at
what
head
this
will
deliver .
So,
head
requirement
and
that
will
be
used
to
calculate
the
horsepower requirement of the pump.
Question
4,
in
Question
4,
it
is
given
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system
operates
12
hours
per
shift.
So,
this
is
the
one
data
available
to
us.
And
then
the
2
shifts
per
day
during
peak
demand
is
used
in
each
irrigation
cycle
of
10
days.
So,
irrigation
cycle
is
given
7
days
means
it
is
weekly
irrigation
cycle
and
area
is
15
hectare.
The
gross
depth
of
irrigation
is
80
millimeter .
Determine the capacity of irrigation system.
So,
once
again
I
am
reading
this
data.
A
sprinkler
system
is
operating
12
hours
per
shift.
2
shifts
are
used
in
a
day
time.
Then,
each
irrigation
cycle
is
of
7
day.
Area
is
15
hectare,
gross
depth
of
irrigation
80
millimeter .
So,
we
need
to
determine
the
capacity
of
irrigation
made
by
sprinkler system.So,
symbols
we
have
used.
If
that
is
area,
for
area
that
is
15
hectare.
Depth
of
irrigation
d
in
80
millimeter ,
number
of
shift
to
irrigation
interval
that
is
7
days
and
12
hours
per
shift
it
is
working.
So,
irrigation
means
here
this
is
the
area
it
is
in
hectare.
d,
the
depth
of
water
application that is in millimeter . So, area in hectare that we can say this is in square meter .
If
I
am
putting
depth
in
mm,
then
it
is
divided
by
1
by
1000
and
area
in
ha
multiplied
by
10,000
so,
this
becomes
10.
So,
this
is
the
unit
constant.
And
I,
since
we
are
interested
to
express
it
in
per
hour,
so,
I
is
the
number
of
irrigation
cycles
in
days.
This
is
2
shifts
and
then,
per
shift,
it
is
operating
in
some
certain
hour
that
is
12
hours.
So,
Q
will
be
calculated
by
simply substituting these values in this particular formula.
𝑄= 10×𝐴×𝑑𝐼×𝑁𝑠×𝑇
𝑄= 10×15×807×2×12=71 .43 𝑚3ℎ−1
That
is
a
71.43
cubic
meter
per
hour.
So,
this
is
a
system
capacity .
System
capacity
is
nothing
but
the
pump
capacity .
So,
pumps
should
be
able
to
deliver
this
much
71.43
cubic
meter
per
hour
to
meet
the
irrigation
requirement
of
15
hectare
when
the
depth
of
irrigation
is
80
millimeter and it is operating 12 hours in 7 days period.
Question
5,
in
this
Question
5,
we
have
been
given
data
of
30
liter
per
second.
Now ,
this
is
a
pump
which
is
delivering
dischar ge
of
30
liter
per
second.
And,
with
this
pump,
100
millimeter
dia.
pipeline
of
100
meter
is
attached.
We
are
required
to
find
out
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
using
Darcy
Weisbach
equation.
So,
we
discussed
about
this
equation
in
the
design
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
when
I
discussed
and
also
we
discussed
this
equation
when
I
dealt
with
design
of
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
in
this
equation,
there
are
some
certain
you
know
Darcy
Weisbach
equation
involves
frictional
factor .
This
value
of
frictional
factor
is
given. This involves a constant c. This involves a constant m. This is involves a constant n.
And
also,
using
Hazen
William’ s
equation.
So,
both
the
equations
which
have
been
discussed
in
theory
class
are
being
here
given
in
the
problem.
And,
in
this
particular
equation,
it
involves
capital
C.
It
is
dealing
with
the
pipe
material
and
diameter
of
the
pipeline.
So,capital
C
is
given
as
140
and
then
the
small
c,
this
particular
thing
is
given
and
then
constant
m is 1.852. Constant n in this equation is 1.17.
And
then,
considering
the
pipe
is
running
without
sprinkler ,
it
is
a
simple
blank
pipe.
Water
is
being
delivered
from
one
end
and
then
supplied
in
the
lateral
and
then
it
is
going
out
of
the
lateral.
Or,
this
is
one
case.
And
then,
another
case,
when
the
pipe
is
having
10
number
of
sprinkler
which
are
equally
spaced
so,
there
are
10
number
of
sprinkler
means
10
outlets
are
provided.
The,
another
part,
it
is
given
the
distance
to
first
sprinkler
is
the
same
as
the
other
sprinkler
heads
spacing.
Means,
all
the
sprinklers
are
at
equal
spacing.
So,
this
is
the
question
which is given and then let us try to see solve this problem.
So,
once
again
I
am
reading
the
data.
Q
is
30
liter
per
second
which
can
be
written
in
terms
of
cubic
meter
per
second.
That
is
0.03
cubic
meter
per
second.
Diameter
of
the
lateral,
100
millimeter .
That
is
0.1
meter .
And,
length
of
the
pipeline
is
100
meter .
Area
simply ,
pi
by
4
D
square.
So,
D
is
known
to
us.
So,
we
are
getting
7.85
into
10
is
to
power
minus
3.
This
is
the
area of the pipeline. And this data, we will be using to find out the velocity of flow .
So,
Q
is
known
to
us.
So,
velocity
of
flow
through
the
pipeline
is
simply
dischar ge
flowing
into
the
pipeline
divided
by
the
area
will
give
the
value
of
3.82
meter
per
second.
This
is
the
velocity of flow through the pipeline. Now , when we use Darcy Weisbach equation,
ℎ𝑓=𝑓×𝐿×𝑣22×𝑔×𝐷×𝐹
So,
Darcy
Weisbach
equation,
it
involves
the
value
of
f.
It
involves
the
L.
That
is
the
length
of
the
pipeline.
Velocity
is
known
to
us.
That
is
we
have
already
got
3.82.
g
is
the
acceleration
due
to
gravity .
D
is
the
diameter
of
pipeline
which
is
if
we
are
expressing
all
in
meter means L  is in meter . This is also in meter .
When
without
having
any
sprinkler
attachment,
it
is
a
blank
pipeline.
So,
a
reduction
factor
formula is used. Here, in this equation,
𝐹= 1𝑚+1+12𝑁+𝑚−1
6𝑁2
This
is
the
reduction
factor
formula
is
used.
To
get
the
reduction
factor
value,
we
are
particularly ,
when
the
sprinklers
are
means
spacing
between
the
sprinklers
are
at
the
samemeans
spacing.
So,
this
formula
is
applicable.
Reduction
factor
formula
is
applicable.
And
the
value
of
m
is
known
to
us,
for
the
Darcy
Weisbach
equation,
m
is
2.
And
then,
number
of
outlets,
it
is
a
simple
one.
Means,
there
is
one,
water
is
entering
from
the
inlet
and
going
out.
So,
it
is,
there
is
one
outlet.
That
is
N.
Capital
N
is
equal
to
1.
So,
simply ,
we
are
substituting
the value,
𝐹= 12+1+12(1)+2−1
6(1)2=1
We
are
getting
as
1.
We
are
substituting
the
frictional
factor ,
length
of
the
pipeline,
100
meter
and
velocity ,
already
we
have
calculated,
V
square
is
3.82
square
meter .
And
then,
substituting the value of diameter , and then, acceleration due to gravity ,
ℎ𝑓=0.03×100×(3.82)22×9.81×(0.1)×1=22.31 𝑚
we get head loss due to friction as 22.31 meter .
With
the
10
number
of
equally
spaced
sprinklers,
the
value
of
F
will
change.
And
this
value
of
F
here,
m
is
already
given
to
as
1.
And
then
capital
N
is
10
and
then,
so,
we
are
substituting in this equation
𝐹= 12+1+12(10)+2−1
6(10)2=0.385
We
get
the
reduction
factor
F
is
0.385.
So,
once
we
substitute
the
value,
the
value
means
this
was
for
one
sprinkler .
So,
I
am
if
I
multiply
0.385
multiplied
by
22.31,
we
will
get
8.59.
Or,
simply , I am substituting F , L, V square by 2 g d.
ℎ𝑓=0.03×100×(3.82)22×9.81×(0.1)×0.385=8.59 𝑚
So,
once
we
substitute
and
multiplied
by
this
reduction
factor
of
0.385,
we
get
the
head
loss
due to friction by Darcy Weisbach equation is 8.59 meter .
Now ,
given
same
problem,
but
by
using
the
Hazen
Williams
equation
for
100
meter
long
pipeline which can be given by
𝐻𝑓100()=𝐾𝑄𝐶
(
)1.852×𝐷−4.871×𝐹Where
K
is
the
unit
constant
and
then,
Q
by
C.
Q
is
the
dischar ge.
C
is
the
given
that
is
140
and
then,
this
dischar ge
in
liter
per
second.
D
is
the
diameter
of
pipeline
in
millimeter
and
F
is the reduction factor . So, this is the equation for 100 meter long pipeline.
So,
same
thing,
when
we
are
calculating
the
friction
factor ,
a
reduction
factor
by
using
the
Hazen
Williams
equation
here,
m
is
1.85
plus
1
divided
by
1
by
2N.
N
is
the
1
because
without
sprinkler
attachment
and
simply
we
are
putting
this.
So,
we
get
the
reduction
factor
F
equal
to
1.
So,
if
I
am
calculating
head
loss
from
100
meter
pipeline
is
given
by
1.22
into
10
is
to
power
12
and
then
Q
is
already
known
to
us.
So,
we
are
substituting
the
value
of
Q
and
then capital C and this D is known to us.
𝐻𝑓100()=1.22×101230140
(
)1.852×(100)−4.871×1
= 12.75 m
So,
we
get
12.75.
So,
what
we
see
if
you
just
compare
the
value?
If
we
see
here
in
previous
problem
we
got
the
without
sprinkler
the
pipeline,
this
is
for
when
we
are
considering
the
per
meter
pipeline.
This
is
100
meter
pipeline
this
is
coming
22.31
and
when
we
are
using
the
Hazen
Williams
equation,
it
is
coming
22.75.
So,
Hazen
Williams
equation,
in
this
case,
what
we
see?
This
is
means
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
by
this
equation
it
is
underestimating.
And
when
we
use
this
equation
for
10
number
of
equally
spaced
substituting
these
values
and
so,
for
10
the
difference
is
only
we
will
be
multiplying
with
the
reduction
factor .
And,
this
reduction factor in this case is 0.402.
0.402𝐻𝑓100()=1.22×101230140
(
)1.852×(100)−4.871×
= 5.13 m
So,
we
are
getting
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
is
5.13.
So,
this
in
this
case
also,
what
we
find?
The
head
loss
due
to
friction
from
this
100
meter
pipeline
with
the
10
number
of
equally
spaced
the
sprinkler ,
It
is
getting
5.13
meter
whereas
in
case
of
Darcy
Weisbach
equation,
we
got
8.59.
So,
what
we
find?
Darcy
Weisbach
equation,
it
is
overestimating.
Of
course,
it
is
overestimating
which
I
can
say
because
the
value
of
F
has
been
considered
as
a
constant which is not constant.It
will
change
as
the
number
of
sprinkler
because
it
is
a
function
of
Reynolds
number .
The
small
f
is
a
function
of
Reynolds
number .
So,
f,
if
I
am
taking
constant,
then
this
kind
of
situation
is
existing.
Otherwise,
the
value
will
be
different.
But,
by
considering
the
same
value
means
constant
value
of
F,
we
when
we
are
comparing,
we
get
this
value.
So,
we
worked out this problem.
Now ,
in
Question
6,
we
are
given
a
sprinkler
irrigation
system
consists
of
2,
186
meter
long
lateral
lines.
The
spacing
between
lateral
line
is
18
meter .
And
allowing
1
hour
for
moving,
each
186
meter
long
lateral
pipeline.
We
are
required
to
determine
the
number
of
hours
required
to
apply
5
centimeter
irrigation
in
16
hectare
square
field.
How
many
days
it
will
take
to
complete
irrigation
if
the
system
is
operated
for
10
hours
per
day
and
the
required
application rate is given to us is 1.25 centimeter per hour .
So,
we
have
been
given
2
lateral
lines
of
186
meter
long
and
then
the
spacing
between
the
lateral
is
18
meter .
1
hour
is
for
shifting
these
laterals
and
then
we
are
required
to
find
out,
how
much
time
it
will
take
if
the
irrigation
is
given
5
centimeter
in
the
area
of
16
hectare,
10
hours is operated per day? Application rate is also available.
So,
this
information
is
available,
application
rate
is
available,
field
is
square.
That
is
your
16
into
10
is
to
power
4
square
meter .
And
then
time
of
operation
is
10
hours
per
day.
So,
we
will
be
irrigation
time
to
apply
5
centimeter
of
depth
at
the
rate
of
1.25
centimeter
per
hour.
So, this is coming capital T is 4 hours. Now , time required for moving the lateral is 1 hour .
So,
total
time
for
each
setting
it
becomes
your
4
plus
1.
That
is
a
5
hours.
Now ,
since,
field
is
16
hectares,
so,
16
into
10
is
to
power
4.
So,
we
can
say
it
has
a
length
of
400
meter .
Means,
400
meter
by
400
meter ,
since,
it
is
a
square
field.
So,
it
will
be
400
meter
long
400
meter
wide.
The
entire
field
of
400
meter
long
it
is
covered
by
2,
186
meter
laterals.
That
means
400
meter
long
where
the
spacing
is
given
to
us
it
is
18
meter .
So,
number
of
moves,
it
is
22
moves.
Means,
we
will
be
shifting
from
one
lateral
with
the,
like
this,
so,
which
is
of
18
meter
spacing.
So,
this
way,
there
will
be
we
can
say
there
will
be
22
number
of
laterals
if
allthe
laterals
are
fixed.
But,
since
movement
is
made,
so,
there
will
be
22
number
of
moves
and
then
total
time
required
for
each
irrigation
is
22
into
5
and
divided
by
10.
So,
because
there
are
10
days,
so,
this,
we,
it
will
need
11
days.
Time
required
for
irrigation
is
11
days.
We
will
means
total
time
required
to
irrigate
16
hectare
of
the
land
with
the
having
the
22
number
of
moves
and
each
moves
requires
5
hours
and
then
10
days.
So,
10
hours
per
day.
So,
this
is
we
are getting 1 1 days to cover the 16 hectares of the land.
You
please
refer
these
books
for
to
work
out
more
problems
related
to
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
In
order
to
summarize
this
lecture,
we
worked
out
numerical
problems
which
dealt
with
capacity
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
We
also
dealt
with
the
finding
out
the
dischar ge
of
individual
sprinklers.
We
dealt
with
the
head
loss
due
to
friction
in
the
pipeline
of
the
sprinkler
system.
And
then,
the
total
irrigation
time
for
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
This
also
we worked out.
In
Tutorial
9,
we
will
be
working
out
we
will
be
going
deeper
having
got
the
experience
of
these
problems.
So,
we
will
deal
in
detail
about
the
design
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
with
given numerical data as an example. So, thank you very much.
