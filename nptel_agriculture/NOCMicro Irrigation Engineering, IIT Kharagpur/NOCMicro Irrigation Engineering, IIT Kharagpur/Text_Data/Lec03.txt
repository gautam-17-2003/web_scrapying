Soil Water Concepts
Yes,
welcome
to
the
third
lecture
on
soil
water
concepts.
This
particular
lecture
is
important
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view .
And
particularly
while
selecting
a
particular
type
of
emission
device,
we
are
required
to
know
how
the
hydraulics
of
soil
water
takes
place
when
we
are
applying
water through micro-irrigation drippers.
In
this
particular
lecture,
we
will
deal
with
soil,
its
different
properties,
type
of
soil,
how
soil
and
water
are
related,
and
how
these
soil
water
concepts
have
been
used,
and
then
different
forces
affecting soil water movement.
When
we
talk
of
soil,
the
soil
is
a
mixture
of
minerals,
organic
matter ,
gases,
liquid,
and
a
myriad
of
organisms
that
support
plant
life.
There
are
several
horizontal
layers
and
these
layers
are
known
as
horizons.
They
are
rich
in
organic
matter
and
then
followed
by
rock
layers.
Any
soil
consists
of
solid
material,
it
consists
of
pores,
and
these
pores
will
have
air
or
partly
filled
with
water or fully filled with the water .
Now
when
we
look
at
different
types
of
soils,
which
are
in
our
country ,
so
different
soil
groups
have
been
classified
based
on
the
colour
or
disintegration
of
the
basic
parent
rock
material.
If
we
look
at
the
pie
diagram,
what
we
see
that
red
soil
dominates
in
the
country
and
it
is
covering
about
105
million
hectares
of
land
area
which
is
about
34%.
Then
next
in
the
order
is
black
soil,
alluvial soil, then these your desert soil, hills, and terai soil, and alluvial soil.
So,
these
soils
are
distributed
if
you
look
at
the
right
side
of
our
Indian
map
and
you
may
see
that
the
large
part
of
the
area
with
this
red
colour
which
we
are
seeing
it
is
being
covered
in
thisgroup.
So,
in
this
area
basically ,
you
may
see
that
the
red
soil
dominating
the
area.
Next
in
the
order is the black soil and then other soil.
So,
they
are
distributed
in
different
parts
of
the
country
and
they
have
got
different
water
retention
properties,
they
have
got
different
water
drainable
property ,
water
drainage
property .
They
have
got
different
properties
accordingly
irrigation
water
is
to
be
supplied
through
micro-irrigation
drip
emitters.
Or
even
conventional
irrigation
system
also
these
soil
groups
their
water holding capacity , they play an important role.
Now
when
we
look
at
black
soil
regions,
so
these
black
soil
regions
are
dominating
the
Deccan
Plateau.
And
the
Deccan
Plateau
area
is
located
in
Maharashtra,
Gujarat,
Madhya
Pradesh,
Karnataka,
Andhra
Pradesh,
Telangana
as
well
as
in
Tamil
Nadu.
Why
does
this
black
soil
it
has
form?
It
is
the
compounds
of
iron
and
aluminum.
These
soils
are
low
in
nitrogen,
zinc,
organic
carbon and they are rich in manganese as well as calcium.
They
have
got
typical
properties
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
water ,
it
swells.
But
when
there
is
a
deficiency
in
moisture
content,
when
the
soil
dries,
the
cracking
problem
comes.
So,
there
is
a
problem
and
particularly
with
drip
irrigation,
it
is
highly
as
suitable
rather
than
giving
water or conveying water through the irrigation channel also it is a great problem.
Now ,
the
major
dominating
crop
in
these
soil
regions
is
cereal
crops,
oilseed
crops,
citrus,
fruits
and
vegetable
crops
.
When
we
look
at
these
crops
you
can
see
citrus,
fruits,
vegetables,
sugarcane,
they
are
you
know
highly
suitable
for
a
drip
irrigation
system.
Alluvial
soils
are
another
group
which
is
you
know
form
due
to
deposition
of
the
rocks
material
due
to
this
overland flow from the river areas and then it gets deposited.
So,
these
regions
are
available
from
Punjab
means
all
the
northern
parts
of
the
country
where
their
several
rivers
are
flowing,
they
are
dominated
by
alluvial
soil
regions.
And
the
majority
of
the cereal crops, as well as vegetable crops, are being grown in alluvial soil regions.Red
soil
regions
as
I
told
you
that
these
red
soil
regions
are
dominating
in
the
states
like
Tamil
Nadu,
Karnataka,
Andhra
Pradesh.
And
these
soils,
if
you
see
this
are
formed
due
to
the
decomposition
of
crystalline
rocks,
and
granites
or
gneisses
are
from
the
rocks.
So,
they
have
formed
and
these
soils
are
rich
in
minerals
and
as
well
as
iron,
potassium,
manganese.
But
they
are
deficient
in
nitrogen;
you
must
as
well
as,
in
phosphorus
rice,
millet,
tobacco,
and
vegetable
crops are being grown.
The
laterite
soil
is
formed
due
to
the
high
temperature.
So,
weathering
of
rocks,
as
well
as
heavy
rain
fall,
takes
place
due
to
these
climatic
variations
and
that
is
causing
the
formation
of
laterite
soil.
These
soils
are
rich
in
iron
and
aluminum
but
as
such
these
soils
have
got
acidic.
These
soils
are
suitable
for
the
cultivation
of
tea
crops,
coffee,
rubber ,
and
then
many
other
crops
which
are
suitable
to
grow ,
apply
micro-irrigation
system,
sprinkler
irrigation
system
and
you
may
find
that
these crops are being irrigated in dif ferent regions.
Arid
and
desert
soils,
arid
and
desert
soils
you
know
it
are
found
in
the
arid
and
semi-arid
regions
where
the
annual
rainfall
is
less
than
500
millimeters.
A
large
part
of
Rajasthan,
Punjab
Kandi
area
of
Punjab,
Haryana
there
you
will
find
that
arid
regions
are
available.
Then
in
the
presence
of
phosphate
and
nitrates,
and
availability
of
soil
moisture
means
irrigation
such
soils
are it becomes fertile.
There
are
several
examples
it
shows
when
irrigation
is
being
given
it
was
all
desert
in
the
Rajasthan
area
due
to
the
application
of
Indira
Gandhi
canal
command
those
areas
have
become
green.
So,
forest
and
mountain
soils
are
the
name
it
says
that
these
regions
are
falling
the
hilly
slopes.
They
are
such
soils
are
brown
in
colour
and
coffee,
tea,
and
tropical
fruits
are
being
grown.
And
once
we
analyze
their
physical
properties,
chemical
properties
accordingly
irrigation
water ,
as
well
as
certain
amendments
in
the
soil,
can
be
made,
and
then
it
can
be
made
productive.Peaty
soils
and
marshy
soils
either
name
says
means
water
stagnates
for
a
longer
period,
these
soils
are
not
having
adequate
means
of
soil
air.
So,
the
cultivation
of
crop
it
becomes
difficult
and say particularly peaty soils they are deficient in copper .
And
then
marshy
soil
most
of
these
soils
are
available
in
Bihar ,
coastal
parts
of
Odessa,
Tamil
Nadu,
West
Bengal,
and
Uttar
Pradesh
and
they
are
deficient.
So,
accordingly ,
the
soil
amendment
is
to
be
done
when
we
want
to
bring
this
soil
into
cultivation.
Saline
and
alkaline
soil
are
also
problematic
soils
and
these
are
available
in
the
arid
and
semi-arid
regions
of
the
country .
If
they
are
to
be
brought
under
cultivation,
then
we
need
to
apply
a
sufficient
amount
of
gypsum
or calcium treatment, so as to bring it otherwise these soils are not suitable for cultivation.
So,
those
are
the
different
types
of
soil
according
to
their
physical
properties,
chemical
property
their
treatment
is
to
be
done
and
these
are
to
be
brought
for
the
cultivation
of
a
specific
crop
and
using
an
appropriate
irrigation
system.
Now
the
next
part
when
the
soil
comes
in
contact
with
the
water ,
how
does
it
behave?
And
then
any
soil
material
if
you
take
it,
it
consists
of
minerals,
it
consists of or ganic matter .
And
then
the
in-between
these
soil
particles,
there
are
pore
spaces,
there
are
pore
spaces
in
these
pore
spaces,
water
is
available
as
well
as
air
is
available.
In
these
pore
spaces
depending
on
the
way
the
soil
composition
exists
and
their
porosity ,
it
exists
the
root
proliferation
takes
place.
And
so,
a
proper
understanding
of
soil
water
is
important
for
plant
growth
and
is
very
important
for
an ef ficient irrigation system.
When
we
say
about
soil
water ,
a
very
important
component
involves
soil
texture.
Soil
texture
means
the
relative
proportion
of
sand,
silt,
and
clay
in
a
given
soil.
So,
when
if
you
see
sand,
sand
when
you
are
putting
water
or
even
without
water
you
feel
like
a
coarse
grain
and
there
as
well
as
gritty .
When
you
see
at
the
clay
these
are
the
finer
particles,
and
when
it
comes
in
contact
with water it looks like it is sticky .And
then
silt,
you
feel
silky
is
smooth
when
it
is
brought
to
the
in
contact
with
the
water
when
we
apply
water .
When
they
are
in
different
proportions
means
loam,
when
I
say
it
is
the
combination
of
sand,
clay,
silt
in
different
proportions
accordingly
the
nomenclature
is
being
given.
Whether
it
is
a
sandy
clay
loam,
whether
sandy
loam,
whether
it
is
a
silt
clay
loam.
So,
different proportions make that type.
So,
this
is
the
diagram,
this
is
the
triangular
diagram
that
gives
the
grouping
that
which
category
a
particular
soil
it
belongs
with.
Just
now
when
I
was
telling
you
the
different
proportions.
So,
you
can
see
here
suppose
let
us
say
it
is
sandy
soil.
So,
in
sandy
soil,
this
side
of
this
triangle
it
is
showing
the
percentage
clay.
This
is
showing
percentage
sand,
this
particular
side
shows
the
percentage silt.
And
if
you
take
a
particular
triangle,
let
us
say
this
particular
triangle,
so
this
is
a
sandy
soil
where
90%
it
is
sand
and
10%
clay.
But
when
they
all
three
are
putting
it
so
different
triangles
you
can
see
it
forms
a
different.
So,
their
nomenclature
has
been
made
based
on
their
proportion
it
is
there.
Now
when
we
say
clay,
silt,
or
sand,
they
are
classified
based
on
the
size
of
the
particles available.
So,
when
we
say
clay
means
it
is
less
the
size
of
the
soil
particle
is
less
than
0.002
millimeter ,
when
I
say
silt,
the
silt
means
the
soil
particles
are
in
the
range
of
0.05
to
0.10.
Now
sand
could
be
of
different
grades,
it
can
be
very
fine
sand,
it
can
be
fine
sand,
it
can
be
very
medium
sand
or
it
can
be
very
coarse
sand.
This
means
the
particle
size
which
is
say
1
millimeter
to
2
millimeters
means it is very coarse sand. So, accordingly , their grouping has been made.
Now
after
knowing
the
soil
texture,
how
these
soil
particles
are
arranged.
It
Means
sand,
silt,
clay
they
are
arranged,
how
they
are
it
has
been
made
a
soil
aggregate.
So,
individual
soil
particle
looks
like
this,
of
course,
this
it
looks
here
a
bigger
side
but
it
could
be
as
small
as
less
than
0.002
millimeters.
Now
when
these
soils
are
forming
together
it
becomes
soil
aggregate.
Now when it is soil aggregate, how they are making the dif ferent structures?So,
you
can
see
here
right
side
this
is
your
granular
structure.
This
is
a
platy
structure,
this
is
you
know
wedge
structure.
So,
how
these
soil
particles
are
arranged
each
other ,
can
be
a
blocky
structure,
it
can
be
prismatic
structure,
it
can
be
columnar
structure.
So,
depending
on
the
arrangement
of
the
particles
they
make
it
and
the
root
growth,
root
penetration,
proliferation
will
depend on the type of soil particles, how they are arranged each other .
Now ,
if
we
look
at
in
this
diagram
if
it
is
sandy
soil
and
water
is
being
given
say
from
the
top
you
are
either
it
is
irrigation
water
whether
it
is
rainfall
water ,
we
were
putting
it.
So,
what
happened?
Since
it
is
sandy
soil,
particle
size
is
large,
the
micropores
are
also
large,
so
the
water
becomes
easy,
and
then
it
starts
draining
very
fast.
In
sandy
loam
soil,
particle
sizes
are
small
and
then
it
is
moderate
means
drainage
of
water
from
the
soil
column
when
it
is
a
sandy
loam
soil,
it
will be lesser than the sandy soil.
When
it
is
clay
soil
what
happened?
The
particle
sizes
are
small,
the
pore
sizes
are
also
small
means
it
consists
of
fine
pores.
So,
the
movement
of
water
is
slow,
very
slow,
and
depending
on
the particular type of this thing.
Now
I
was
telling
you
any
soil
system
consists
of
the
grain,
it
consists
of
the
pores.
Now
if
it
is
a
grain
means
it
is
a
solid
and
when
we
take
it
as
a
1
say
1
cubic
meter
volume
of
a
soil
column.
Now
in
proportion
wise,
if
we
are
making
it,
so
some
part
of
the
proportion
volume
is
having
solid,
some
part
it
will
have
the
pore
space.
So,
we
can
say
the
1
cubic
volume
of
this
soil
column, has some space where the pores are there.
And
some
have
got
solid
particles;
this
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
the
mass
of
air.
This
can
be
expressed
say,
so
this
pore
space
consists
of
air,
it
can
consist
of
water .
So
that
depends
you
know
how
much
pore
space
whether
is
completely
fully
dry
soil,
there
is
no
moisture
content.
So,
it
is
the
only
entire
volume
of
the
pore
volume
is
full
of
air.
So,
it
will
say
Va
plus
Vw
is
simply V
V
, that is a volume of a void, the total volume
of void.So,
if
we
can
say
if
it
consists
of
air,
water ,
and
solid,
the
one
part
we
are
putting
a
mass
of
air,
another
one
we
are
telling
a
mass
of
the
water ,
the
mass
of
the
solid
particles.
And
when
we
are
summing
together
it
becomes
the
total
mass
of
the
soil
particles
or
soil
column,
and
this
can
be
expressed by volume of air , the volume of water , volume of solid.
So,
these
volumes
as
well
as
the
mass
it
can
be
expressed
with
certain
terminology
which
are
important
when
we
are
giving
water .
So,
one
important
parameter
is
known
as
particle
density
or
true
density .
What
is
particle
density?
It
is
given
by
the
mass
of
solid
divided
by
the
volume
of
solid.
When
I
was
putting
you
3
points
that
is
the
volume
of
solid,
volume
of
air,
the
volume
of
water , so this is the volume of solid.
Dry
bulk
density
is
the
mass
of
solid
divided
by
the
volume
of
total
volume.
So,
the
total
volume
is
nothing
but
the
volume
of
solid
plus
volume
of
air
plus
volume
of
water .
Now ,
the
dry
bulk
density
values
for
the
different
soil
textures,
just
now
I
told
you
about
sandy
soil,
loamy
soil,
for
different soil textures you may see that these values are available.
So,
these
are
used
for
several
structural
designs
for
irrigation
purposes
when
we
want
to
do
for
different
purposes
the
value
of
bulk
density ,
as
well
as
particle
density ,
is
being
used.
Now
total
bulk
density
when
we
say
total
mass,
so
the
mass
of
solid
plus
the
mass
of
air
plus
mass
of
water ,
this
is
referred
as
a
total
mass
and
V
t
is
the
total
volume.
And
then
other
terms
depending
on
the
void space means air and water .
So,
a
total
void
is
expressed
as
the
porosity .
So,
porosity
is
basically
the
volume
of
void
divided
by
total
volume.
So,
the
volume
of
void
means
the
volume
of
air
plus
the
volume
of
water ,
so
this
is
your
total
porosity .
Now
this
can
be
expressed
also
in
terms
of
bulk
density
and
true
density units, so this can be given by 1 minus rho b by rho s, so that can we calculated.Soil
water
content
someone
wants
to
know
how
much
is
the
soil
water
means,
how
much
amount
of
water
present
in
the
soil?
This
is
measured
in
terms
of
gravimetric
water
content,
mass
water
content,
or
soil
water
content.
Soil
samples
it
collected
by
using
the
soil
core
and
then
the
sample
is
brought
into
the
laboratory .
We
weigh
the
sample
along
with
the
water
or
the
sample
has
got
dry soil plus water .
And
then
we
are
weighing
it
and
then
drying
the
soil
sample
at
105
degrees
Celsius
for
24
hours
in
the
oven
we
keep
and
then
we
find
out
the
dry
sample.
And
then
determine
the
amount
of
water available in the soil that is the mass of water divided by the mass of solid.
We
can
express
these
values
in
terms
of
volumetric
units.
Volumetric
units
mean
the
volume
of
water
present
in
the
soil
sample.
So,
this
can
be
given
by
the
volume
of
water
in
a
total
volume
of
soil.
So,
which
can
be
also
expressed
in
terms
of
soil
moisture
content,
so
theta
v
can
be
given
in
terms
of
volumetric
water
content.
So,
a
volumetric
form
of
water
content.
So,
moisture
content by weight you have got and then you are multiplying with this ratio.
That
is
a
bulk
density
divided
by
the
bulk
density
of
water ,
bulk
density
of
the
soil
divided
by
bulk
density
of
water ,
and
this
density
of
water
we
consider
it
as
a
1
gram
per
cc.
If
we
want
to
express
what
is
the
depth
of
water
in
the
soil
layer .
So
this
volumetric
water
content
is
there
if
we
multiplied
by
the
depth
of
soil
sample
we
have
considered.
So,
this
one
can
get
what
is
the
equivalent depth of water available in the soil.
Now
we
come
across
different
types
of
soil
water
in
the
literature.
And
which
are
had
some
certain
physical
meaning.
If
we
look
suppose
it
is
a
saturated
soil
column
when
we
are
allowing
the
water
to
flow
by
gravity
and
the
soil
sample
from
the
column
it
is
coming
out
of
freely
under
the
influence
of
gravity ,
this
water
is
known
as
gravitational
water .
And
from
the
potential
point
of view , this particular potential is 0 for the saturated water .And
when
it
brings
to
the
field
capacity
it
is
up
to
0.33
bar,
so
we
say
0.0
the
gravitational
water
is
available
at
0
potential
or
0
metric
potential
or
0
to
0.33
bar.
When
another
category
of
water
is
capillary
water ,
from
the
potential
point
of
view
it
is
from
0.33
bar
to
31
bar.
And
then
hygroscopic
water ,
this
is
a
very
a
specific
condition
when
the
soil
is
dry
and
then
the
soil
sample
is
exposed
to
the
water
vapor
then
because
of
the
pores
of
a
region
the
soil
particles
are
attracting
the soil water molecules and then this water is there that is called hygroscopic water .
So,
which
is
explained
like
this,
when
the
soil
means
there
are
micropores
and
what
went
it
is
gravitational
water ,
water
is
flowing
freely
from
these
pores.
When
it
comes
to
the
capillary
water ,
this
is
the
available
water ,
this
water
is
not
available
from
the
irrigation
point
of
view .
Capillary
water
is
the
only
water
that
is
available
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view .
And
this
capillary
water
basically
what
happened?
When
suppose
there
is
a
water
table
and
then
on
the
top, there is sandy soil.
So,
because
of
the
capillary
forces,
water
starts
rising.
So,
the
particle
the
pore
sizes
are
larger,
so
the
movement
of
water
is
lesser
and
in
the
case
of
clay
soil
the
pore
size
is
smaller ,
so
the
water
is
rising.
So,
the
plant
takes
water
for
meeting
its
evapotranspiration
requirement
that
is
capillary
water .
And
this
water
hygroscopic
water
is
from
an
irrigation
point
of
view ,
it
has
no
meaning
because this water is not available as such for the plant to give irrigation.
There
are
some
forces
this
is
a
very
important
part
when
I
have
told
you
that
one
part
is
your
gravitation.
It
is
the
water
held
tightly
to
the
soil
surface
and
absorptive
forces.
So,
there
are
forces
that
are
acting
and
that
are
being
captured
by
the
soil
particles.
So,
adhesive
forces,
as
well
as
cohesive
forces,
are
responsible
for
holding
the
water
that
is
the
capillary
water .
Now
the
water when it takes place movement from the soil to the plant root system.
If
it
is
normal
clear
water
without
any
salinity ,
the
moment
of
water
is
not
turkish
when
sufficient
water
is
taking
place.
But
if
the
water
or
soil
has
got
salinity ,
because
of
the
salinity
in
the
water
the
movement
of
water
is
slow.
Now
the
water
which
takes
place
from
the
higher
concentrationto
the
lower
concentration,
this
process
is
known
as
osmosis.
So,
the
osmotic
effect
takes
place,
so
here
the
adhesive
forces
and
then
cohesive
forces
as
well
as
osmotic
forces
are
important
when irrigation water or water movement from the soil to the plant system takes place.
Now ,
so
gentlemen,
the
participant
we
have
discussed
in
the
lecture,
what
is
the
soil?
What
are
the
different
types
of
soils?
And
then
what
are
the
different
textural
parts
of
the
soil?
How
this
soil
aggregates
its
form
that
is
the
soil
is
structure
part,
soil
property ,
in
relation
to
irrigation
water
application.
So,
soil
texture,
soil
structure,
soil
water
quality ,
and
forces
in
relation
to
soil
water
movement
that
we
have
discussed
in
this
lecture.
Now
forthcoming
lecture,
we
will
discuss
about soil water constant and soil water movement.
These are the books which one can refer to in this particular lecture, thank you very much.
