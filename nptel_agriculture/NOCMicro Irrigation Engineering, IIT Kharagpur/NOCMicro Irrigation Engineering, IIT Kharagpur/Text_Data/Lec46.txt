 Lectur e - 46 
Standards and Quality Assurance of MIS Components
Welcome
participants,
I
invite
you
to
the
lecture
46
of
micro
irrigation
engineering
subject.
Lecture
46
is
on
standards
and
quality
assurance
of
micro
irrigation
system
components.
In
this
lecture,
we
will
be
mainly
covering
topics
on
testing
of
materials
and
then
the
different
types
of
test
involved.
And
then
what
are
the
different
standards
of
micro
irrigation
system
components
and
their
testing.
And
then
what
are
the
different
IS
codes,
which
are
used
for
different
components of MI systems.
Now ,
what
is
testing
and
how
testing
is
carried
out?
So,
concept
of
testing
is
an
integral
part
of
research
and
development,
product
design,
manufacturing,
means
once
we
are
developing
any
product,
we
should
see
that
this
product
does
it
fulfil
the
requirement?
What
is
the
life
of
the
particular
product?
How
effective
this
product
is?
How
much
the
range
of
the
specified
boundaries it can under go? So, this is a very important part of the testing.
And,
then
test
can
be
carried
out
from
the
small
specimen
not
for
the
entire
product.
Let
us
say
that,
we
are
developing
a
dripper .
So,
randomly
from
the
thousands
of
dripper
only
25
numbers
of
a
specimen
can
be
taken
for
a
test,
and
then
one
can
come
out
with
the
whether
does
it
satisfy
the
particular
criteria.
So,
these
tests
can
be
non-destructive
type
of
test
or
destructive
type
of
test.
So,
non-destructive
test
normally
it
is,
preferred
because
we
are
not
disturbing,
not
destroying
the
product,
that
product
can
be
used
so
naturally
it
is
expensive.
So,
what
I
am
telling
here,
this
non-destructive
tests
are
expensive
as
compared
to
destructive
test,
and
it
uses
ultrasonic
and
radiographic
method
which
are
advanced
non-destructive
test.
Why
we
carry
out
test
to
prove
design
concept,
to
prove
basics
for
reliability .
How
reliable
a
particular
product
is?
To
look
for
the
safety
point
of
view ,
there
are
some
certain
product
which
has
been
made,
whether
it
is
safe
to
use
and
safety
precautions
has
been
it
is
following,
and
then
protectionagainst
the
product
liability ,
quality
control,
to
meet
standards
and
specification,
to
verify
manufacturing
process,
to
evaluate
competitors
product
which
are
available
other
product
of
same
nature,
and
to
establish
a
history
for
new
material.
So,
these
are
the
purposes
for
which
test
is being carried out.
These
tests
could
be
of
a
different
means
analytical
test,
they
can
be
material
characterization
test,
and
they
can
be
material
property
test
these
could
be
of
using
the
product
test.
The
purpose
of
analytical
test
to
test
the
quality
control,
to
develop
a
new
product,
to
design
the
product,
to
optimize
the
process
or
when
we
are
doing
analytical
test,
we
need
to
make
the
test
for
the
density ,
we
need
to
make
test
for
the
specific
gravity .
Of
course,
it
will
depend
upon
the
particular
type
of
product.
It
could
be
the
moisture
analysis,
it
could
be
the
water
absorption
point of view , and it could be from the sieve analysis point of view .
When
we
talk
of
the
material
characterization
test,
it
is
basically
carried
out
to
identify
the
material,
to
find
out
the
chemical
composition,
to
find
out
what
is
the
structural
characteristic,
to
find
out
the
flow
behaviour ,
if
it
is
a
plastic
material
mainly
from
the
plastic
point
of
view .
So,
we
try
to
know
that
what
kind
of
test
it
is
to
be
carried
out.
So,
means
flow
point
of
view .
So,
we
will
be
characterizing
these
material
characterization
tests
by
having
the
material
flow
or
by
using
the
test
for
viscosity ,
molecular
weight
distribution,
and
thermal
properties.
Then
spectroscopy , microscopy , these are the other things.
And
then
material
property
test;
basically
there
are
various
properties
which
are
required
to
be
tested
at
per
the
prescription
made
by
the
American
society
of
testing
material
that
ASTM
or
ISO.
There
are
some
many
other
properties
which
are
used
for
the
testing
of
the
material.
So,
these
properties
could
be
of
mechanical
behaviour ,
thermal
behaviour
that
is
thermal
property ,
from
the
electrical
behaviour
electric
property
we
will
be
testing.
How
opaque
this
material
is?
How
the
optical
property?
It
is
varying
from
the
weathering
point
of
view .
How
fast
it
is
getting
weathered
or
it
is
getting
deteriorated,
so
weathering
process
and
chemical
properties.
So,
these
are the properties which are used for testing.There
are
several
organizations,
which
are
available
in
the
world.
These
organization
basically
they
formulate
the
guideline
for
a
particular
type
of
material.
Now
with
respect
to
your
micro
irrigation,
with
respect
to
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
there
are
different
agencies
for
the
different
components
of
these
things.
So,
these
agencies
they
look
for
the
standardization.
So,
one
is
ISO,
that
is
international
organization
for
standardization.
The
head
office
is
located
at
Switzerland
and
then
the
international
electrochemical
property .
So,
this
is
a
chemical
commission
that
is
related
to
electrical
field.
Now ,
with
respect
to
agricultural
and
food
material,
these
are
the
agency
they
look
for
their
property
testing
material.
That
is
the
bureau
of
Indian
standard,
then
there
is
a
British
standard
institute,
American
society
for
testing
material
ASTM,
and
then
ISO
and
then
American
society
of
agricultural
engineers.
Now
this
particular
society's
name
has
been
changed
to
American
society
of
agricultural
and
biological
engineers
ASABE
and
then
American
nationally
standard
institute
these
are
the
ANSI.
So,
these
are
the
some
of
the
organization
they
are bringing out dif ferent specification and test procedures. So, that the testing can be carried out.
So,
with
respect
to
micro
irrigation
component
standards
and
then
these
are
the
indicators
performance
indicator
which
will
be
tested
and
bring
out
the
particular
value.
So,
one
of
the
important
thing
from
the
micro
irrigation
component
point
of
view ,
because
these
are
made
up
of
plastics.
So,
an
important
characteristic
to
measure
the
melt
flow
index.
So,
there
is
a
machine
which
is
used
the
right
composition
of
material
and
then
the
composition
of
material
will
describe
that,
this
should
be
the
value
of
melt
flow
index
for
a
particular
material,
plastic
material.
So,
a
tensile
strength
is
normally
it
is
a
tested
by
using
the
universal
testing
machine
and
indeed
it
gives
a
strength
of
the
material
and
elongations
shows
the
extension
of
the
material
under load.
So,
your
specimen
is
kept
at
this
particular
point
and
then,
they
are
stretched.
So,
this
is
the
thing
and
then
load
there
is
a
load
indicator ,
how
much
load
we
are
giving
exactly
and
so,
this
test
is
carried
out
for
a
special
shaped
piece
obtained
by
dumbbell
and
then
elongation
is
measured
at27
degrees
temperature.
And,
then
the
value
is
obtained
and
then
for
a
specific
product,
this
value is fixed. So, accordingly the tensile strength is measured.
Then
environmental
stress
cracking
resistance,
this
indicates
the
strength
of
the
material
against
breakage
of
various
environmental
conditions.
So,
a
water
bath
with
thermostatic
control,
vernier
callipers
that
is
used
for
measuring
the
thickness
as
well
as
the
elongation
how
much
it
takes
place,
ball
ended
micro
meter ,
forced
air
circulation
oven.
And,
these
are
the
devices
which
are
used for this environmental stress cracking resistance.
The
reversion
test
to
find
out
the
internal
stress
during
process
of
the
lateral
pipeline.
A
pipe
of
about
200
meter
long
is
subjected
to
a
temperature
of
100
degree
Celsius
for
about
an
hour
and
cooling
to
the
room
temperature
is
brought
in
a
shorter
period
and
dimensional
changes,
if
it
takes
changes,
it
should
be
within
the
three
percentages.
So,
this
is
the
reversion
test
and
this
particular
device
is
reversion
tester
oil
bath.
So,
this
device
is
used
for
measuring
the
reversion
test.
And,
then
thermostatic
oven
is
that
instrument
which
is
used
for
this
test.
Carbon
black
content,
this
is
another
important
thing
and
particularly
for
finding
out
the
appropriate
stability
of
the
ultraviolet
stabilization.
So,
carbon
black
concentration
is
essential
to
ascertain
the
lateral
can
provide appropriate UV  stability .
Lateral
that
is
a
lateral
pipeline,
so
black
carbon
is
added
in
the
pipeline
in
a
specific
amount.
So,
this
should
have
a
specific
supplied
density
when
carbon
is
being
added,
and
it
should
be
means
to
the
extent
of
about
10%.
So,
to
know
the
black
carbon
content
in
the
particular
material,
when
we
are
adding
this
is
by
using
the
carbon
content
analyser
is
used
and
with
the
pure
nitrogen
cylinder is used to measure the black carbon content.
Then
carbon
dispersion
is
another
property
and
that
is
also
studied.
So,
here
the
carbon
dispersion
test
is
made
to
know
the
good
UV
stability
of
the
lateral
pipeline.
A
device
known
a
microscope
with
the
magnifier
of
200
times
is
used
to
find
out
the,
how
much
carbon
dispersion
it
has
taken
place
and
it
should
be
also
within
the
prescribed
value.
So,
hydraulic
characteristics,it
is
the
internal
pressure
creep
rupture
of
the
poly
tube.
That
is
conducted
to
know
the
hydraulic
characteristics.
Acceptance
test
lower
temperature
of
for
a
small
test
duration
of
about
one
hour
is
conducted.
Quality
test
higher
temperature
with
the
longer
duration
of
about
say
100
hours
to
stand
the
specified
induced
stress
of
22.5
mega
Pascal
and
20
degree
Celsius
for
one
hour
at
induced stress of 6.9 mega Pascal is used. So, this is for pressure creep rupture tester .
So,
these
tests
are
important
and
when
we
want
to
know
the
longevity
means
instead
of
waiting
for
one
year,
two
year
or
five
year
then
how
the
deterioration
it
is
taking
place
in
a
short
period,
in
minutes
or
in
hours,
when
a
particular
compound
and
the
particular
specimen
is
kept
for
a
duration.
Then
such
test
give
the
value
that
what
will
be
the
longevity
of
the
particular
component.
Now ,
these
are
the
some
of
the
standards
of
the
various
components,
which
had
been
prescribed
and
this
should
follow
the
test
values
prescribed
by
the
ISO.
As
per
the
BIS
standard
for
main
pipeline
and
sub-main
pipeline
of
drip
irrigation
system
it
should
have
means,
the
standards
which
have
been
prescribed
for
PVC
pipe.
It
should
follow
the
standard
IS
4985
2000
and
for
HDPE
pipeline
IS
4984
1995.
For
lateral
pipeline
of
12
millimetre
and
16
millimetre,
this
is
the
particular
standard
type
have
been
specified.
Emitting
pipe
system,
emitters
or
drippers
which
are
pressure
compensating
or
non-pressure
compensating,
there
is
been
a
particular
specification,
it
has
been
given,
micro
tube,
micro
sprayers
so,
these
specifications
have
been
already
specified
and we should pass through this test.
And,
then
another
important
component
for
the
drip
irrigation
system,
where
we
are
telling
all
the
time
that
is
dripper
should
have
clogging
free.
And,
then
to
remove
the
suspended
impurities
in
the
water
we
use
filters.
So,
filters
should
also
pass
through
some
certain
specifications
which
are
specified
by
the
bureau
of
Indian
standards
and
these
are
the
number
for
strainer
filter
IS
12785
for
medium
filter ,
hydro
cyclone
filter ,
this
particular
number
is
given.
Then
fertilizer
applicator ,
that
is
your
fertigation
equipment
for
this
also,
the
specification
has
been
given.
And,
for
pressurized
irrigation
equipment
and
then
terminology ,
it
has
been
given.
In
this
particularinstallation
guidelines
and
recommendation
criteria
for
adoptability
of
different
irrigation
methods.
Irrigation
components
that
have
also
been
given.
So
prevention
and
treatment
of
blockage
problem
in
drip
irrigation
system
and
their
component
practices,
these
are
also
specified.
Now ,
the
standards
which
I
gave
say
for
drip
lateral.
Drip
lateral
it
is
made
up
of
polyethylene.
Normally
these
are
drip
lateral
these
are
made
up
of
LDPE,
LLDPE
and
then
it
should
be
withstand
internal
pressure
creep
rupture
test
at
the
temperature
of
70
degree
Celsius
for
100
hour
at
induced
pressure
of
2.5
mega
Pascal
at
20
degree
Celsius
per
1
hour
and
induced
stress
of
6.9
mega
Pascal.
So,
this
is
the
range
of
the
pressure
which
has
been
suggested
for
testing
the
deep
lateral
pipeline
and
this
is
the
specification.
Maximum
longitudinal
reversion
of
pipe
after
keeping
it
at
temperature
of
100
degree
plus
minus
2
degree
Celsius
for
1
hour
shall
be,
so
whatever
elongation
or
shrinkage,
it
should
be
within
the
range
of
3%
this
is
the
recommended
thing.
The
tensile
strength
and
resistance
to
internal
pressure
are
major
properties
to
be
tested
for
laterals.
And
tensile
strength
at
break,
this
is
the
test
range
means
27
degree
plus
minus
2
degree
Celsius
and
test
speed
of
100
millimetre
per
minute,
and
then
plus
minus
10
mm
per
minute,
P
should
not
be
less
than
10
mega
Pascal.
So,
this
is
for
finding
out
the
tensile
strength.
So,
UTM
which
I
was
telling
that
universal
test
machine,
we
need
to
apply
this
kind
of
test
by
giving
this
much of pressure.
Then
pipe
shall
withstand
the
accelerated
test
for
susceptibility
to
environment
stress
cracking,
and
so
in
a
short
period
when
we
are
giving
such
things.
This
will
be
useful
for
a
longer
duration,
study
one
can
know
in
before
when
the
in
the
laboratory
conditions,
when
tensile
strength
or
melt
flow
index,
this
should
be
one
should
make
it
done.
So,
that
these
are
properly
understood
that it is working.
So,
emitting
pipe,
these
are
the
lateral
pipeline,
but
pipe
itself,
it
is
an
emitting
water .
So,
here
also
means
this
particular
code
the
particular
emitters
or
emission
pipeline,
it
is
given
that
when
you
are
collecting
dischar ge,
this
dischar ge
should
be
within,
variation
should
be
not
more
thanplus
minus
5%.
So,
if
it
is
falling
within
plus
minus
5%,
we
are
putting
such
pipelines
as
category
A,
that
is
a
very
good
category
we
can
say.
And
then,
if
it
exceeds
it
means,
if
it
exceeds
5%
but
within
the
10%
plus
minus,
then
it
is
brought
under
category
B
pipeline
and
if
it
goes
beyond
this
value,
it
means
such
pipelines
should
not
be
used
for
drip
irrigation
purpose.
Because
this
will,
what
will
happen?
This
will
not
meet
the
requirement
and
basic
purpose
of
using
drip
irrigation
system
will
not
serve.
Emitting
pipe
cell
withstand
hydrostatic
pressure
of
1.8
times.
And
recommended
working
pressure
at
ambient
temperature
of
1
hour
and
temperature
of
60
plus
minus
2
degree
Celsius
for
48
hours.
So,
this
is
another ,
that
what
is
the
hydrostatic
pressure,
it
should
be
the
stand.
The
emitting
pipe
cell
also
bear
the
tensile
strength,
this
is
the
hydrostatic
pressure
means
when
water
is
flowing,
and
this
is
the
tensile
strength
when
it
is
under
certain
tension
of
the
pipe.
So,
it
should
be
180
Newton.
So,
it
should
bear
the
tensile
force of 180 Newton for 15 minutes at elevated temperature of 50 plus minus 2 degree Celsius.
So,
joined
between
fittings,
this
is
the
part
we
say
particularly
when
the
temperature
goes
very
high,
say
in
case
of
during
summer
month,
in
case
of
Rajasthan
field
conditions
where
the
drip
line
is
laid
in
sandy
soil.
So,
this
kind
of
situation
will
happen,
so
this
should
be
tested
before
it
is
fitted
that
whether
it
passes
through
the
tensile
strength.
Then
the
emitting
pipe
shall
bear
the
pull of 180 Newton for 1 hour , this is another condition.
Then,
main
and
sub
main
pipeline
this
is
the
IS
code,
it
has
been
specified
for
the
PVC
and
this
is
for
HDPE
and
BIS
specification
for
the
plastic
materials
here.
The
PVC
pipe
base
material
the
density
is
from
1.40
to
1.46
gram
with
the
K
value
of
minimum
64.
For
high
density
material,
the
base
material
density
should
be
in
this
range
that
is
0.9405
to
0.9460
gram
per
cc,
and
then
melt
flow
index
is
also
given
0.4
to
1.1
gram
per
10
minute
at
190
degree
Celsius
per
5
kg
load.
So,
these
are
the
specified
values
and
that
should
be
tested.
Carbon
black
should
be
tested
similarly
the
extrusion
is
carried
out
under
strict
quality
control
condition
to
ensure
that
the
internal
and
external
diameters
are
remain
within
the
specified
tolerance.
Short
term
hydraulic
test
is
to
be
conducted
to
detect
the
manufacturing
defect
periodically ,
and
the
long
term
hydraulic
test
toassess
the
durability
of
the
pipeline.
So,
it
means
the
pipe
should
be
withstanding
the
hydraulic
resistance, it should be withstand the tensile part and it should withstand the black carbon.
Emitters,
which
just
now
when
we
are
talking
about,
this
is
the
smallest
component
and
this
is
very
important
component
of
the
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
smallest
measured
flow
path
dimension
and
then
the
dimension
declared
by
the
manufacturer
that
what
is
the
size
of
the
orifice
from
which
the
water
is
appearing.
So,
if
it
is
a
micro
tube
there
will
be
one
dimension
and
if
it
is
a
very
fine
and
the
tape
by
wall
kind
of
system.
There
it
will
have
a
different
dimension.
So,
emitters
shall
be
tested
to
resistance
to
hydraulic
pressure
and
leakage
at
pressure
twice
the
maximum
working
pressure.
Mean
emission
rate
of
25
randomly
selected
emitter
shall
not
deviate
from
nominal
dischar ge
rate
and
that
should
be
within
the
not
more
than
5%
for
the
category A, and not more than 10% for the category B, plus minus 10% for the category B.
So,
these
are
the
two
ranges
which
has
been
given,
if
it
exceeds
more
than
the
means
10%,
then
the
dripper
should
be
rejected
and
then
the
new
dimensions
or
new
dripper
should
be
developed
or
used.
Micro
tube
it
has
got
another
code
and
this
would
follow
that
it
should
confirm
the
requirement
for
this
longitudinal
reversion,
the
tensile
strength
and
environmental
stress
cracking
for
the
small
polyethylene
tubing’ s.
Because
micro
tube
is
the
polyethylene
tube,
this
is
also
made
up
of
LDPE
or
LLDPE.
It
should
be
withstand
hydraulic
hydrostatic
pressure
1.2
times
the
maximum or operating pressure when, what we are operating the dif ferent pipeline.
And
for
different
material,
for
different
materials
say
PVC
pipeline,
HDPE
pipeline,
LDPE
pipeline,
LLDPE
pipeline
and
these
are
the
different
material
or
property
characteristics
and
these
are
the
prescribed
values.
So,
these
product
what
we
are
doing
with
this
pipeline
which
is
being
developed
it
should
follow
in
this
range.
Means
density
in
this
range,
K
value
it
should
be
minimum
64,
then
manufacturing
melt
flow
index,
it
should
be
in
this
range
like
this
for
different
pipeline, PVC, LDPE or LLDPE and these are the prescribed values and one this would be used.
Micro
sprayers
is
another
device
which
is
used
in
the
drip
irrigation
system;
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
it
should
bear
the
hydraulic
pressure
1.2
times
the
maximum
working
pressure
for
aperiod
of
1
hour
threaded
connections
shall
be
the
strength,
torque
of
20
Newton
meter .
This
much
that
is
the
pressure
which
should
be
applied.
In
uniformity
of
flow
rate
should
be
plus
minus
10%
and
regulated
sprayer
plus
minus
7%
for
non-regulated
sprayers.
So,
regulating
micro
sprinklers,
micro
sprayers
deviation
in
maximum
and
minimum
of
regulation
range
should
be
plus
minus
10%
and
average
value
should
be
within
the
range
of
plus
minus
2.5%
of
the
nominal
flow
rate.
Then
the
diameter
of
coverage
that
is
the
water
is
sprayed
in
a
diameter
and
so
this
would
be
within
plus
minus
10%
of
the
manufacturer's
value.
After
the
operating
the
micro
sprayer
for
1500
hours
measure
the
flow
rate
and
then
we
should
find
out
how
much
variation it takes place.
Strainer
filter ,
it
should
follow
this
particular
guideline
and
these
are
the
setup
the
values,
which
has
been
recommended,
it
should
means
the
filter
element
should
not
under go
the
buckling
or
tearing
pressure.
So,
it
should
be
test,
under go
these
test
and
then
the
clean
pressure
drop,
it
should
be
less
than
10%
of
the
pressure
prescribed
by
the
manufacturer
media
filter ,
means
whatever
the
strainer
it
has
got
it
should
follow .
And
then
guideline
for
setting
the
media
for
the
preparation
of
the
bed,
it
should
be
there.
And,
then
the
sand
which
is
used
it
should
be
graded
sand
and
it
will
pass
through
the
10%
of
the
sample
of
the
sand,
then
coefficient
of
uniformity
Cu,
that
is
given
by
ah
D60
by
D10,
that
is
the
diameter
of
the
particles
which
are
which
passes
through
the
60%
and
then
the
diameter ,
D10
this
ratio
through
the
same,
then
we
will
this
ratio
should be within the range of 1.4 to 1.6.
These
are
the
recommended
flow
rate
for
the
media
filters
depending
on
the
contaminant
available
in
the
water
suspended
material
available
in
the
water
if
the
contaminant
is
between
0
to
10
milligram
per
litter,
then
the
flow
rate
recommended
is
63
cubic
meter
per
hour
per
square
meter
of
the
surface
area
of
the
filter ,
media
filter .
Similarly
for
other ,
if
it
is
a
heavy
then
the
flow
rate
will
reduce
that
is
43
to
50
cubic
meter
per
hour
when
the
contaminant
available
in
the
water is 101 to 400 ppm level.Venturi
injector ,
this
is
for
the
fertigation,
this
is
the
IS
specification
which
has
been
recommended.
So,
where
the
motive
flow
water
suction
rate
of
the
test
liquid
should
not
vary
more
than
plus
minus
10%
from
the
declared
value
and
minimum
pressure
drop
as
far
as
possible
it
should
have
so
that
the
head
loss
due
to
friction,
a
head
loss
from
the
system
of
the
fertigation
system,
it
should
be
within
the
prescribed
limit.
There
are
code
of
practices,
which
are
used
for
design
and
operation
of
the
field
evaluation
of
micro
irrigation
system.
So,
these
standards
should
be
made
in
terms
of
coefficient
of
variation,
emission
uniformity ,
and
allowable
pressure
variation,
what
is
the
filtration
requirement
and
then
what
is
the
chemical
water
treatment,
fertilizer
system,
injection
system,
flow
monitoring
etcetera.
So,
there
are
set
of
the
guidelines,
which had been defined in this case.
So,
we
can
see
here
from
the
coefficient
of
variation
point
of
view
and
if
we
are
using
the
point
source
emitter
then
Cv
range,
the
range
of
the
Cv
it
is
given
and
if
here
what
we
see
the
coefficient
of
variation
means
the
dischar ge
which
has
been
collected
from
the
set
of
the
drippers
and if there dischar ges, Cv is less than 0.05 it is a such drippers are of excellent category .
Now
like
these
values,
Cv
values
are
given
and
it
is
a
poor
category
say
0.11
to
0.15
for
the
point
source
emitter .
For
the
line
source
emitter
and
the
greater
than
0.2
is
marginal
and
less
than
0.1
is
good.
And
if
it
is
going
more
than
greater
than
0.2
marginal
are
here
in
case
of
it
is
a
poor,
we
should
not
select
it,
we
should
simply
reject
that
a
lot
and
then
ask
for
the
new
product
so
that
the
good
uniform
emission
uniformity
we
can
get.
And,
then
recommended
range
of
the
design
uniformity
for
the
point
source
on
the
perennial
crop,
the
crop
spacing
is
greater
than
4
and
it
is
laid
in
this
type
of
slope
less
than
2%,
greater
2%
then
what
we
see
that
the
emission
uniformity
should
be
in
this
range
i.e.
85
to
95%,
it
should
be,
if
it
is
not
then
we
have
to
make
the
changes
in
the
design.
Similarly ,
for
other
condition.
These
are
the
topographical
condition
and
these
values
are
there,
so
this
particular
table
is
a
guideline
and
this
should
be
tested
and
it
should
fall
in this range.Similarly ,
for
the
clogging
problem,
so
code
of
practices
for
prevention
and
treatment
of
the
blockage
problem
in
duplication
system,
and
this
is
a
serious
problem
in
replication
system
particularly
from
the
suspended
solid
point
of
view ,
because
it
clogs
the
system,
the
efficiency
of
the
system
get
affected.
So,
this
should
be
taken
a
due
care
while
we
are
operating
the
drip
irrigation
system,
so
that
the
blockage
problem
can
be
prevented.
So,
standard
covers
recommendation
for
testing
of
quality
of
irrigation
water
and
then
the
chemical
treatment
devices,
what
is
the
cause
of
the
blockage,
method
of
assessment.
These
things
should
be,
so
it
should,
it
also
covers
the
recommended
dose
of
chlorine
and
treatment.
So,
this
is
the
code
which
has
been
prescribed
that
is
IS
14791
is
the
specific,
there
it
has
been
given
and
one
should
follow
and read these things and this water should follow this practice.
So,
to
get
more
detail
you
are
advised
to
go
three
through
these
references
and
there
are
standard
books
and
also
there
are
BIS
standards,
which
I
have
mentioned
there
in
the
discussion.
So,
go
through
in
detail.
We
are
summarizing
the
in
this
particular
lecture,
we
discussed
about
the
different
types
of
test.
The
test
to
be
used
for
MI
components,
what
is
the
standard,
Indian
standard
formulated
test
for
the
micro
irrigation
components,
code
of
practices
for
design,
installation,
operation,
field
evolution
of
micro
irrigation
system.
Now
in
the
forthcoming
class
we
will
also
study
the
standards
and
quality
assurance
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
components.
So, thank you very much for your patience hearing.
