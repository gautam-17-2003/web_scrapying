Micr o Irrigation-Intr oduction and Scope
Hello
participants,
I
am
introducing
a
new
subject
on
micro
irrigation
engineering.
This
subject
has
been
designed
considering
the
importance
of
water
and
then
the
amount
of
water
which
is
used
for
irrigation.
Irrigation
consumes
a
huge
amount
of
water
and
there
is
a
lot
of
wastage
of
this
water .
There
is
a
demand
by
other
sectors,
industries,
domestic
purposes,
and
there
is
another
utilization of water resources.
So,
irrigation
is
an
important
component.
Ours
is
an
agriculture-based
economy .
So
how
to
reduce
the
water
supply
for
agricultural
production,
micro-irrigation
assumes
an
important
role.
We
have
introduced
this
particular
subject
on
micro-irrigation
engineering
on
the
NPTEL
platform
and
this
is
lecture
1.
In
this
lecture,
we
will
be
discussing
what
is
the
importance
of
micro-irrigation? and what is the scope of micro-irrigation engineering subject.
In
this
particular
lecture,
we
will
be
discussing
a
brief
introduction
of
the
course,
the
concept
of
micro-irrigation, and what are the scopes of micro-irrigation.
So,
this
course
is
of
12
weeks
duration.
In
these
12
weeks,
we
will
cover
60
lectures
for
the
entire
subject
and
each
lecture
will
be
of
30
minutes
duration.
Each
week
there
will
be
about
2.5
hours
and
at
the
end
of
each
week,
there
will
be
one
assignment.
So,
a
total
of
12
assignments
will be there for the whole course. At the end of the course, there will be an online examination.
We
will
be
covering
mainly
broad
topics
related
to
soil,
plant,
water ,
and
atmosphere
relationship.
How
to
determine
the
water
requirement
of
the
crops
and
then
this
can
be
supplemented
by
using
the
appropriate
micro
irrigation
devices.
Measurement
of
irrigation
wateris
another
important
topic.
Drip
irrigation,
micro-sprinkler
irrigation,
fertigation,
automation
of
micro-irrigation, are broad topics.
Now ,
the
total
course
contains
11
modules
and
each
module
has
lectures.
Also,
we
have
design
tutorials
on
major
topics.
So,
module
1,
deals
with
the
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
and
soil
water .
Micro-irrigation
and
its
introduction
will
be
covered
in
lecture
1.
Fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
and
its
application
to
micro-irrigation
will
be
covered
in
lecture
2
and
followed
by
soil water concept, soil water constants, and infiltration in Lectures 3 and 4.
So,
on
these
topics
whatever
the
fundamental
concept
will
be
covering,
there
will
be
some
numerical
problems
which
we
will
work
out
in
tutorial
1.
In
lecture
2,
you
can
see
here
we
have
given
the
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
and
its
application.
So,
we
will
not
be
giving
the
wide
coverage
but
its
importance.
We
will
be
refreshing
your
knowledge
of
what
you
have
been
studied
in
a
major
fluid
mechanics
course.
But
it's
basic
fundamental,
its
units,
and
then
mainly
the
terminologies
which
are
there
in
the
fluid
mechanics
that
will
be
utilized
in
micro-irrigation
system is covered in this lecture 2.
Module
2
is
on
crop
water
requirements.
In
this
particular
module,
the
basic
parameters
are
used
to
determine
the
evapotranspiration
and
there
are
various
other
terminologies
which
are
in
evapotranspiration
that
will
be
covered
in
lecture
6.
Followed
by
lecture
7
crop
coefficient
and
crop water requirement is another topic that will be dealt with in lecture 8.
Demonstration
of
agro
metrological
instruments.
We
have
established
several
equipments,
mainly
you
can
see
here
lecture
9
and
lecture
10
demonstration
part.
So,
demonstration
of
established
equipment
in
our
farm.
These
types
of
equipment
and
these
data
we
are
using
for
various
purposes.
So,
we
will
discuss
this
in
lecture
9
and
lecture
10.
Then
whatever
the
basic
concept
which
we
have
covered,
we
will
be
solving
numerical
problems
on
crop
water
requirement in lecture 1 1.Module
3
is
on
irrigation
water
management,
which
will
be
covered
in
week
3.
So
in
irrigation
water
management,
lecture
12
is
meant
for
irrigation
scheduling.
We
will
be
discussing
that
how
much
amount
of
water
is
to
be
given
at
what
intervals
based
on
the
evapotranspiration
requirement
which
we
have
established.
So,
soil-water -plant
monitoring
instruments,
this
is
another important component which you will know .
And
this
is
a
very
important
part
one
should
learn
about
irrigation
scheduling
and
irrigation
water
measurement,
the
important
topic
which
will
be
discussed
in
lecture
14.
Then
irrigation
efficiency ,
any
system
when
we
are
installing
how
efficiently
it
is
working.
So,
whether
it
is
a
surface
irrigation
method,
whether
it
is
a
drip
irrigation
method,
whether
it
is
a
micro-irrigation
method, all these methods dif ferent terminologies are involved.
How
to
evaluate
the
system?
So,
that
will
be
covered
in
the
topic
of
irrigation
efficiency
in
lecture
15.
Lectures
16
is
kept
for
tutorial
3
which
will
be
solving
the
numerical
problems
on
irrigation water management.
In
the
4th
week,
we
will
be
covering
the
module
4
lectures,
and
module
4
is
kept
for
irrigation
water
lifts
and
pumps.
So,
irrigation
water
lifts
mean
the
available
water ,
whether
it
is
at
a
shallow
depth
or
it
is
at
the
deep
water
table.
So,
different
types
of
devices
which
are
used
for
lecture 17 and 18, it is meant for irrigation water lifts and pumps.
The
next
part
is
irrigation
water
quality .
Irrigation
water
quality
for
the
drip
irrigation
system.
It
is
important
because
of
the
devices
which
are
used
use
very
small
orifices.
So,
water
when
it
is
passing
if
it
is
of
poor
quality ,
is
likely
to
be
clogged.
So,
irrigation
water
quality
is
another
important component of this particular lecture.
And
then
tutorial
4
is
kept
in
lecture
20,
that
those
are
the
problems
which
are
related
to
the
water
measurement
and
pumps
will
be
dealt
with
in
tutorial
4.
Lecture
21,
here
are
all
the
different
methods
of
water
applications.
We
discussed
in
module
3
irrigation
scheduling,
inmodule
2
we
discussed
evapotranspiration.
There
we
discussed
how
much
amount
of
water
to
be
given at what interval should be given?
Here
is
how
to
give
irrigation
water ,
for
irrigation
method
whether
it
is
a
surface
irrigation
method,
it
is
subsurface
irrigation
method
or
it
is
the
irrigation
given
by
sprinkler
or
micro-irrigation.
So,
here
the
broad
classification
of
different
methods
will
be
discussed
in
lecture 21.
We
are
discussing
the
main
course,
which
means
up
to
module
4,
we
can
say
we
have
discussed
fundamentals
of
the
subject,
basic
terminologies
which
are
used.
And
now,
those
terminologies
and
fundamentals
will
be
utilized
in
the
micro-irrigation
component
which
will
start
from
module
5.
So,
you
can
see
here
lecture
22
to
lecture
you
can
say
here
lecture
30
means,
5
th
week
and the 6
th
week, all these topics are related to
micro-irrigation.
So,
in
micro-irrigation,
the
topic
says
lecture
22
you
have
drip
irrigation,
different
types
of
drip
irrigation,
and
then
drip
irrigation
design
consideration
and
system
layout,
types,
and
selection
of
emission
devices,
hydraulics
of
drip
irrigation
pipe
network.
So,
we
studied
fluid
mechanics,
now
the
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
will
be
used
for
the
design
of
the
drip
irrigation
system
pipe network.
Numerical
problems
on
design
of
drip
irrigation
system,
fertigation
application,
methods
of
fertigation,
and
then
different
types
of
filters,
which
will
be
covered
in
lecture
30.
And
then
the
numerical
problems
related
to
the
selection
of
emission
devices
as
well
as
the
fertigation
will
be
dealt with in tutorial 6, this is given in lecture 31.
Then,
this
module
5
continues
which
we
see
week
7
and
week
8
are
also
on
micro-irrigation
different
topics.
So,
installation
and
operation
of
drip
irrigation
system
lecture
32,
maintenance
of
drip
irrigation
system.
You
will
see
how
the
system
can
be
installed
and
then
this
is
a
beautiful
example because the students and participants will be exposed to how to install the system.This
is
an
important
topic
when
any
student
joins
in
the
micro
irrigation
industry ,
they
are
given
a
task
to
go
to
the
field
and
install
the
micro-irrigation
system.
How
to
maintain
the
micro
ignition
system?
So,
this
is
a
very
important
topic.
Demonstration
of
drip
irrigation
components
and
evolution
of
drip
emitter .
This
is
practically
a
system
that
we
have
developed
for
how
to
evaluate the performance of drip emitters.
So,
we
have
developed
a
test
bench
and
then
you
will
be
given
enough
time
to
understand
that
how
to
evaluate
a
drip
emitter .
So,
this
is
another
topic,
which
is
important.
Then,
soil
water
movement
under
drip
emitter ,
means
the
research
work
has
been
carried
out
by
the
large
number
of
students
who
worked
with
me
and
this
is
basic
fundamental
research
means
work
which
is
required
one
should
know
when
we
know
the
infiltration
process.
But
when
the
water
coming
from a drip emitter , when it is falling on the soil, and how does it move below the soil surface.
So,
here
it
involves
research
exposure
and
how
the
water
is
moving
under
a
drip
emitter .
Then
design
and
development
of
a
drip
emitter ,
an
economical
drip
emitter ,
is
another
challenging
task
and
we
will
be
given
exposure
to
how
to
design.
Then
fundamentals
of
the
continuity
equation,
fundamentals
of
Navier -Stokes
equations.
They
will
be
utilized
for
the
development
of
dripper ,
we
did
this
work
at
our
place
by
some
of
my
students
they
have
been
working
and
we
are
exposing
you
to
this
topic
so
that
you
can
come
out
with
another
different
low-cost
drip
emitters.
So, those things will be used here.
This
is
not
only
for
the
agriculture
engineering
student
rather
this
is
also
useful
for
the
micro-irrigation
industry .
So,
that
they
can
design,
they
can
come
out
with
the
economical
small
size
dripper .
So
that
it
becomes
less
expensive
and
farmers
can
adopt
such
types
of
drippers.
So,
lectures
37,
38,
and
39
will
be
dealt
with
in
week
8
of
module
5
and
these
topics
are
already
given in these lectures.Module
6
is
for
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
This
sprinkler
irrigation
system
is
an
overhead
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
This
is
also
an
efficient
method
of
water
application.
This
particular
method
of
irrigation
initially
was
used
for
tea
gardens
but
now
a
large
number
of
farmers
are
showing
interest.
So,
it’s
basic
performance
how
the
sprinkler
system
looks
like,
how
it
should
be designed? So, lectures 40 and 41 will be covered in week 8.
Week
9,
we
are
talking
about
how
to
evaluate
a
sprinkler
system.
So,
this
is
also
a
laboratory
experiment
you
will
be
given
one
sprinkler
head
and
then
various
parameters
that
are
required
to
evaluate
a
sprinkler
head
that
will
be
discussed
in
this
lecture
42.
There
are
numerical
problems
related
to
the
various
aspects
of
sprinkler
irrigation
systems
and
their
design
will
be
discussed
in
lectures
43
and
44.
Then,
its
installation,
layout,
its
operation,
and
maintenance
will
be
dealt
with
in week 9 of lecture 45.
Module
7
is
another
important
part.
Any
manufacturer ,
when
they
manufacture,
it's
quality
and
its
reliability
of
working,
it
is
very
important.
The
Bureau
of
Indian
standards
and
international
research
standard
organization
in
Switzerland.
And
the
Bureau
of
Indian
Standards
is
located
in
New
Delhi.
So,
the
standard
they
have
specified
the
quality
parameters,
and
those
standards
will
be
discussed
for
the
drip
irrigation
system
in
lecture
46.
And
then,
the
standard
and
quality
assurance
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system
components
has
been
dealt
with
in
lecture
47.
So,
module 7 is meant for standards and quality assurance of irrigation system components.
Module
8
is
another
important
component.
This
is
on
a
solar
PV-operated
micro-irrigation
system
and
this
will
be
covered
in
week
10.
Lecture
48,
is
basically
for
the
basic
understanding
of
why
solar
PV,
that
is,
the
solar
photovoltaic
system
for
irrigation
part
1
where
different
terminologies,
different
important
terms
it
will
be
dealt
with.
Lecture
49,
is
about
the
design
of
the
system
and
then
how
to
match
the
solar
power
system
with
the
micro-irrigation
system.
So,
the
matching
and
integration
part
will
be
dealt
with
in
lecture
49
and
then
in
lecture
50,
we
will
be dealing with the numerical examples on solar PV  irrigation systems.Now
the
government
of
India
is
promoting
this
system
and
a
large
number
of
engineers
not
only
from
the
agriculture
engineering
discipline,
but
the
other
disciplines
also
have
engineers
say
electrical
engineering,
as
well
as
electronics
engineering,
will
be
needed
for
this
particular
aspects
and
already
this
system
is
being
installed
for
power
generation.
So,
one
should
attend
this
course, this particular topic is very important from that point of view .
Module
9
is
on
automation
of
micro-irrigation
system
and
this
is
a
given
in
11
th
week.
And
then,
all
4
lectures
on
automation
of
micro-irrigation
systems,
that
is
lecture
51
is
part
1
where
we
are
discussing
different
types
of
the
systems
of
automation,
Internet
of
things
(IoT)
then
your
information
and
communication
technology ,
there
are
various.
And
then,
different
types
of
sensors
how
to
integrate
these
sensors
with
hardware,
and
then
how
to
automate
micro-irrigation
system,
these
are
discussed
in
lecture
these
4
lectures.
The
point
is
this,
these
lectures
are
useful
not
only
for
the
students
those
who
are
attending,
but
whether
industry
those
who
are
interested
to come with it, is useful for them and then the lectures are useful for agricultural engineering.
These
lectures
are
also
useful
for
electronics
and
electrical
engineering
students
and
we
invite
them
to
be
there.
So,
that
the
discipline
of
this
agricultural
engineering
and
this
particular
course,
micro-irrigation
engineering
this
will
be
useful
and
then
it
can
go
to
the
field
and
farmers
can
adopt these technologies.
Module
10
is
the
economic
evolution
of
the
micro-irrigation
system,
any
system
when
we
are
talking
unless
it
is
not
economically
viable,
will
not
be
accepted
by
the
community .
So,
what
are
the
different
terminologies
which
are
used
for
economic
evolution,
economic
analysis
will
cover
in
lecture
55,
lecture
56,
and
lecture
57?
These
all
3
lectures
on
the
theory
part
of
the
economic
analysis
have
been
discussed.
And
then,
the
numerical
examples
related
to
the
terminology ,
theory ,
which
we
are
discussing
in
those
three
lectures
will
be
used
to
solve
the
problems
related
to the economic analysis of the micro-irrigation system.Module
10
is
dealt
with
in
week
12.
So,
in
this
one
module
11,
we
are
discussing
precision
agriculture.
This
is
a
new
emer ging
topic
and
where
a
large
number
of
disciplines
are
interested.
It’s
not
only
agriculture
engineering.
Because
it
involves
various
facets;
it
involves
the
sensors,
it
involves
the
remote
sensing
application,
it
involves
GIS
application,
and
it
involves
mechanical
engineering.
Mechanical
engineers
are
interested
because
it
involves
various
aspects
of
robotics,
it involves the various aspects of this UA V unmanned aerial platform that is the drone.
So,
a
large
number
of
disciplines
are
involved
and
this
is
where
micro-irrigation
also
played
at
one
of
the
input
components.
So,
we
will
be
discussing
in
lecture
59
and
lecture
60,
it
is
the
concluding
part
of
this
course,
how
this
course
what
we
have
developed,
what
we
are
dealt
in
all
59 lectures will be covered in lecture 60, that is micro irrigation engineering epilogue.
Now ,
coming
to
this
particular
lecture
in
more
detail
let
us
try
to
know
about
the
micro-irrigation
system.
You
know
water
is
a
precious
element.
It
is
a
nature's
gift
and
without
water
no
life.
So,
water
is
the
life
of
any
living
system
all
of
us
will
survive
when
water
is
there
on
the
planet.
So,
living
systems
exist
on
the
planet
because
of
the
availability
of
water .
And
for
any
country ,
the
growth
and
development,
economic
development
will
depend
on
how
efficiently
water
is
being
managed and it is available on the planet.
So,
water
demand
is
by
various
sector:
agriculture,
wildlife,
domestic,
industry ,
there
are
all
other
sectors
it
requires
it
has
a
demand.
Health
and
environment
also
require
water
and
the
health
and
environment
of
any
city,
any
country
it
depends
on
how
efficiently
water
is
being
used
and managed as well as available in the system.
Now ,
when
we
are
talking
just
now
I
told
water
use
and
how
it
is
being
utilized
and
the
loss
or
wastage
it
is
taking
place.
So,
we
are
taken
for
example
you
know
3
aspects,
one
is
agriculture,
another
one
is
domestic,
industry ,
and
reservoirs.
Now
if
you
see
means
here
from
1900
to
2025
the
projected
forecasted
part
and
these
are
the
available
data.
So,
when
we
are
seeing
these
data,
3 components have been discussed.So,
green
here
in
case
of
agriculture
when
you
are
seeing
here,
the
dark
green
it
is
for
water
withdrawal
means
water
is
extracted
either
from
the
groundwater
or
surface
water
that
is
the
withdrawal
it
is
being
taken.
So,
you
can
see
here
mean
the
water
withdrawal
is
continuously
kept
on
increasing.
There
are
no
decrees
rather
it
is
increasing
exponential
increase
is
there.
And
then also the consumption means the water being withdrawal or it is being supplied.
So,
what
we
see
here
is
the
consumption
and
then
water
withdrawal.
So,
the
rest
of
the
thing
is
the
wastage,
it
is
the
loss,
which
means
we
are
wasting
more
than
what
we
are
withdrawing.
And
this
gap
if
you
see
this
gap
it
keeps
on
increasing.
So,
this
gap
which
we
will
see
here
that
this
gap
keeps
on
increasing.
So,
this
is
the
in
agriculture
as
compared
to
if
you
see
here
in
domestic
supply ,
there
is
a
demand
it
is
increasing.
It
is
also
you
see
their
water
being
distracted
while
the
domestic sector is also increasing because of the increase in population.
So,
demand
is
increasing,
of
course,
the
living
standard
of
the
people,
people
have
started
using
washing
machine,
in
washing
machine
also
a
lot
of
water .
So,
various
aspects
where
the
water
is
being
consumed
and
water
which
is
being
used
for
a
particular
purpose,
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
water
it
could
be
wasted.
The
same
thing
is
happening
in
the
case
of
industry
and
then
a
huge
amount
of
water
it
is
going
as
the
lost
as
evaporation
loss.
So,
in
various
sectors,
the
water
which
is being extracted and then it is being used there is exist.
And
then
global
when
we
look
at
the
global
water
scarcity .
So,
what
we
see
the
in
2000
these
are
already
you
know
the
availability
of
water
is
less
than
1000
cubic
meters
per
person
per
year;
it
is
less
than
available
in
these
places.
But
when
we
look
at
2050,
you
know
where
the
dark
red
exists
means
it
is
increasing
and
India
is
not
safe.
We
will
be
also
falling
between
1000
to
2000
cubic
meters
per
year
per
person
that
is
the
projection.
So,
demand
for
the
water ,
it
going
to
be
more and we will be falling in the category where water is scarcity zone will come.Now
there
are
you
can
see
here
the
from
the
Indian
perspective
point
of
view ,
we
have
the
total
if
we
take
there
are
2
important
sources
that
are
land
and
water .
Flow
out
of
the
total
global
water
scenario
if
you
see
we
have
got
only
4%
of
the
water
scenario
and
2.3%
land.
In
2.3%
of
the
global area, we have got 17% of the population and 1 1% is the livestock.
So,
means
we
have
a
huge
population,
less
amount
of
water ,
less
amount
of
the
land
and
that
is
what
it
is
being
reflected
in
the
number
wise
if
you
look,
we
have
got
out
of
the
1953
billion
cubic
meters
of
water ,
only
690
billion
cubic
meters
of
water
is
surface
water
available.
Similarly ,
the
groundwater
for
total
utilizable
water
resources
is
1032
billion
cubic
meters
and
so
means
the
present
level
of
utilization
is
about
60%
of
the
available
water .
So,
we
are
left
only
40% of the water in the years to come.
This
is
another
interesting
part
if
you
see
here,
to
take
1
cup
of
coffee
we
need
you
to
know
140
liters
of
water .
Similarly
for
if
we
are
cultivating
rice
crops
to
get
1
kg
of
rice
we
have
to
huge
3000
liters
of
water .
So,
these
are
some
of
the
important
statistics,
we
need
to
know
from
this
particular
slide
if
you
look
at
these,
we
need
to
grow
such
crops
which
are
less
water
consuming
and also we need to go for such methods of irrigation where there is less water wastage.
So,
if
you
look
at
the
figure
this
is
just
to
make
you
aware
that
we
have
a
329
million
hectare
area
out
of
which
172
million
hectare
area
is
cultivable
area.
And
the
net
irrigated
area
is
about
70
million
hectares
and
based
on
the
different
crops
which
are
suitable
which
can
be
grown
by
using
micro-irrigation
system
that
is
69.5
million
hectares
from
this
69.5
million
hectare,
27
million
hectare
area
it
can
be
brought
by
using
a
drip
irrigation
system.
A
sprinkler
irrigation
system can be adopted in a 42.5 million hectare area.
So,
by
converting
if
we
convert
1
lakh
hectare
area
under
a
micro-irrigation
system,
we
will
be
saving
347
million
cubic
meters
of
water
annually .
Just
too
simply
by
1
lakh
hectare
area
and
we
will
be
saving
energy
of
271
lakh
kilowatt-hour
per
year.
So,
this
is
the
another
exchequer
ofrupees
105
crore
rupees
will
be
saved
if
we
are
using
a
micro-irrigation
system
to
apply
fertilizer
along with irrigation water . That is why MI plays an important role.
What
is
MI?
What
is
micro-irrigation?
Micro-irrigation
is
the
precise
application
of
water
at
the
root
zone
of
the
crop
either
in
the
form
of
a
drop
by
drop
or
continuous
drop
or
tiny
streams
through
you
by
using
the
emission
devices.
We
deliver
here
the
water
to
wet
the
plant
root
zones
means
wet
the
soil
near
the
plant
root
zone.
And
it
can
be
kept
at
the
soil
surface
or
below
the
soil surface.
We
need
to
select
an
appropriate
emission
device
considering
the
type
of
soil,
considering
the
particular type of crop, and then knowing how much is the amount of water it requires?
It
requires
low-pressure
systems
and
different
devices
are
used
it
could
be
a
drip
emitter;
it
could
be a micro-sprinkler , jet sprayer , bubbler , fogger .
All
these
are
the
devices
that
are
used.
We
will
be
discussing
in
detail
of
course
when
we
will
come
to
that
particular
lecture.
But
this
is
the
overall
layout
of
the
micro
irrigation
system
where
water
is
being
supplied
from
the
source,
it
goes
to
the
nutrient
tank,
it
goes
to
the
filter
then
it
comes
to
the
main
pipeline.
And
from
the
main
pipeline,
it
is
supplied
to
the
sub-main
pipeline
depending
on
the
number
of
the
laterals,
we
want
to
give
irrigation
accordingly
the
water
will
is
given to the laterals.
These
are
the
smaller
pipelines
and
on
the
lateral
pipeline
emission
devices
are
fitted
and
then
water
is
given
to
the
individual
plants.
So,
there
are
different
ways
of
giving
water
to
the
plants
that we will be discussing in coming lectures.
Why
micro-irrigation
system?
Because
you
can
see
here
when
you
compare
the
water
utilization
and
then
water
application
efficiency ,
when
we
give
a
flood
irrigation
system
the
application
efficiency
is
40
to
60%.
When
it
comes
to
the
sprinkler
irrigation
system,
we
are
gettingapplication
efficiency
from
70
to
90%,
because
the
center
pivot
system
is
also
one
of
the
types
of
sprinkler
irrigation
system.
And
when
we
are
using
micro-irrigation
or
drip
irrigation
systems
we
are achieving 90% of irrigation.
So,
you
can
see
here
when
we
are
using
a
surface
conventional
method
of
irrigation,
how
the
water
is
being
given?
The
whole
freely
flooded
plant
does
not
need
that
much
water
when
we
are
using
the
drip
irrigation
system,
you
can
see
only
the
part
of
the
area
where
the
water
should
be
given,
it
is
being
given.
So,
that
is
why
the
micro-irrigation
system
takes
an
important
role
and
this would be taught in the program.
It
has
got
some
certain
advantages
there
are
water
saving,
the
enhanced
plant
growth
and
it
gives
the
higher
yield,
there
is
a
uniform
and
better
quality
of
the
produce.
Here,
there
is
an
efficient
and
economic
use
of
fertilizer .
I
was
telling
you
we
are
saving
an
exchequer
of
105
crore
rupees
when
we
only
irrigate
with
the
micro
irrigation
system
in
a
1
lakh
hectare
area.
That
is
why
you
know the economic use of the fertilizer , efficient way of the water fertilizer can be given.
There
is
less
weed
growth
because
water
is
given
at
a
particular
point,
so
the
whole
field
is
not
flooded
so
moisture
is
not
available.
There
is
less
weed
growth
take
place,
the
possibility
of
using
saline
water .
This
method
of
irrigation
can
be
used
in
the
wasteland
also
because
water
is
applied
at
a
very
slow
rate.
So,
there
is
no
soil
erosion,
there
is
flexibility
in
operation
you
can
give
water
at
half
of
the
field
at
one
time,
the
whole
field
at
a
straight,
there
are
several
operations it is possible because it has control.
Easy
in
installation,
well
this
requires
skill
in
installation.
I
will
say
once
it
is
installed,
so
there
is
no
problem
at
the
later
stage.
There
is
a
labor -saving,
suitable
to
all
types
of
terrain
means
level
land,
it
is
hilly
terrain
and
down
the
slope
all
kinds
of
terrains
it
can
be.
And
then
because
the
part
of
the
area
it
is
being
irrigated,
it
is
not
coming
in
contact
the
whole
field
is
not
flooded
for there is less possibility of disease and pest infestation.There
are
you
know
disadvantages
and
limitations
of
the
system.
It
involves
high
initial
investment;
no
doubt
the
government
of
India
is
promoting
this
irrigation
system.
So,
a
subsidy
to
the
tune
of
50%
is
given
to
the
farmers.
It
involves
of
course
maintenance
requirements
because
emitters
and
clogging,
emitters
clogging
is
the
problem,
yes
it
is
there
and
this
needs
regular , so this is one limitation.
Restricted
plant
root
development,
so
this
means
when
it
is
the
water
is
being
given
from
the
surface,
so
root
development
takes
at
that
is
one
of
the
limitations.
Salt
accumulation
near
the
plant
root
system
takes
place,
yes,
if
we
are
using
salty
water ,
saline
water
then
this
is
kind
of
a
thing. So, we need to apply at a higher dischar ge rate.
So, this particular lecture, these are the references you can refer to in this particular course.
And
so
in
this
particular
course,
we
discussed
the
different
modules
and
different
lectures
which
are
there.
We
also
discussed
the
importance
of
a
micro-irrigation
system.
In
the
forthcoming
lecture
we
will
be
dealing
with
the
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics
and
its
application
to
micro-irrigation systems, thank you very much.
