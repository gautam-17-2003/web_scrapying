Micr o Irrigation Engineering: Epilogue
Hello
participants
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
subject,
you
attended
59
lectures.
And,
this
has
been
journey
of
12
weeks.
In
12
weeks,
you
did
large
number
of
exercises.
You
attended
all
the
subjects.
And,
this
is
the
concluding
lecture
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering.
So,
we
will
be
refreshing
something
what
we
learned
and
what
we
covered
in
previous
classes.
So,
this is the concluding lecture.
And,
if
we
refresh
our
knowledge,
when
we
started
in
the
Lecture
1,
we
discussed
about
importance
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering,
why
we
have
developed
this
course.
This
course
was
not
available
in
NPTEL
platform,
whereas
lot
of
emphasis
has
been
given
by
Government
of
India
and
various
state
government
agencies.
They
are
interested
to
implement this particular technology in their states.
So,
we
will
be
discussing
something
about
refreshing
your
knowledge
related
to
importance
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering.
We
will
be
also
discussing,
what
are
the
Government
of
India’ s
initiatives
to
promote
micro
irrigation
in
different
states?
What
are
the
opportunities
and
scope
of
Micro
Irrigation
Engineering
in
India
where
the
large
number
of
engineers,
scientist,
agriculture
extension
workers
and
several
NGOs
will
be
involved?
We
will
also
briefly
summarize
this
course
content.
So,
this
is
the
overall
the
coverage
in
this
particular
lecture we will deal with.
In
these
particular
59
lectures,
if
you
look
we
have
taken
material
which
were
available
is
scattered
in
different
places.
So,
lectures
covered
in
this
course
are
compendium
of
the
text
materials
collected
from
different
sources
such
as
books,
research
publications,
dissertations,
and
proceedings
of
conference,
technical
reports,
and
the
material
available
in
government
reports.
So,
these
things
we
have
tried
to
bring
at
one
particular
platform
and
which
I
tried
to
deliver you.Now ,
coming
back
to
I
am
just
once
again
as
I
told
you
I
am
refreshing
your
knowledge.
So,
rationale
of
this
particular
course,
this
is
related
to
agriculture
because
when
we
talk
of
irrigation
means
it
is
agriculture
and
the
contribution
of
agriculture
in
GDP
of
our
country
as
per the estimates of 2020-21, it is 19.9%. 15% of the export it is purport from agriculture.
Agriculture
employs
55%
of
the
workforce.
That
is
the
important
means
important
part
that
it
gives
employment.
Large
bulk
of
the
people
those
who
are
educated
or
skilled
or
unskilled
persons.
They
it
is
employing.
Now ,
when
we
look
at
the
agriculture
involves
huge
amount
of
water .
That
is
your
84%
of
the
total
water
available
is
being
used
for
irrigation.
Other
sectors
are there, but the demand from the other sector will also grow .
So,
if
we
look
that
the
right
now
I
mean
not
now
rather
we
say
as
per
the
figures
available,
407
billion
cubic
meter
water
being
used
for
agriculture
in
the
year
1985.
It
will
go
to
740.
Almost,
it
is
coming
to
the
90%
of
the
water
will
be
required
by
2025.
But,
available
water
is
very
limited.
This
is
the
thing.
And
then,
demand
from
the
other
sector
will
also
grow
and
which
you
see
here,
from
other
sector ,
Non
Agri
sector ,
the
demand
was
70
billion
cubic
meter
in
1985.
It
has
gone
4
times
high.
It
will
go
4
times
high
that
is
280
billion
cubic
meter
by
2025.
So,
this
is
the
important
part
that
how
to
get
this
water?
How
to
use
this
water
efficiently
if
the
demand
goes
like
this?
And
then,
another
information,
it
says
that
the
groundwater is being extracted more.
It
is
the
easily
available
source
of
water
supply
and
60%
of
the
total
groundwater
is
being
you
know
it
is
used.
In
agriculture,
when
we
are
talking
of
the
irrigated
agriculture,
groundwater
support
60%
and
40%
it
comes
from
surface
water .
Whereas,
huge
investment
Government
of
India
since
before
independence
and
after
independence
era,
huge
amount
of
the
funds
it
has
been
spent
for
development
of
surface
water
and
the
reservoirs,
canal
development.
This
has
been
done.
But,
this
water
is
it
is
only
contributing
to
40%.
So,
this
is
another
important
part
that
if
we
continues
to
withdraw
water ,
there
will
be
huge
means
water
table
will
be
declining
and
availability
of
water
to
the
in
general
other
sector
as
well
as
for
the
domestic
sector it is going to be af fected for drinking water also.And
then
see
the
figure
which
I
want
to
tell
you
that
the
total
utilizable
water
is
1,030
billion
cubic
meter
which
is
the
summation
of
the
available
water
of
surface
water
690
and
340
billion
cubic
meter
of
surface
water
and
groundwater ,
which
is
60%.
So,
this
is
also
available
resource.
We
are
almost
coming
closer
to
the
available
water
which
is
there
for
utilization.
So, we need to use this particular water judiciously for agriculture purpose.
Now ,
the,
another
important
part,
which
if
you
look
that
when
we
talk
of
water
being
used
for
agriculture
purpose,
water
use
efficiency
is
very
low.
You
can
see
here
it
is
only
30
to
40%
water
it
has
got
water
use
efficiency .
Means
we
can
say
here
it
is
60
to
70%
of
water ,
it
is
going
as
wastage.
And,
this
is
because
we
are
using
the
canal
irrigation
system.
Huge
amount
of water it goes from the canal that we cannot avoid.
I
do
not
say
that
yes,
we
should
not
use
surface
water ,
we
should
not
use
canal
water ,
but
we
are
required
to
see
that
the
minimum
loss
of
water
takes
place
that
is
from
canal.
And
then,
when
it
comes
to
the
field,
then
in
the
field
also
field
to
field
irrigation
takes
place
so,
then,
proper
water
use
management
technology
is
to
be
adopted.
Government
of
India
has
set
up
the
National
Water
Mission
that
the
water
use
efficiency
should
be
enhanced,
should
be
increased by 20% in all sectors.
That
is
the
important
target
or
mission.
They
have
given
goal
they
have
fixed
that
it
should
increase.
Then,
the
figure
which
I
was
just
projecting
that
there
is
a
demand
of
water
which
will
be
increasing
4
times,
now,
you
can
see
here
per
capita
availability
of
water
will
be
going
to
be
decreased.
And,
this
is
you
can
see
here
in
2004,
the
per
capita
water
availability
was
6,008
as
compared
to
the
initially
it
was
6,008
it
decreased
to
1,250
cubic
meter
in
2004
and
it
is
likely
to
further
decrease
by
2025.
So,
this
is
another
serious
part
that
is
availability
of
the
water
is
going
to
be
decreased.
So,
present
problem
is
all
about
management
of
water
resources in an ef ficient manner .
So,
we
need
to
use
efficient
water
management
practices
so
that
the
substantial
area
it
can
be
brought
under
irrigation.
And,
one
of
the
important
technology
where
micro
irrigation
can
take
place,
micro
irrigation
is
one
of
the
best
water
application
method
which
can
play
an
important role.Now ,
these
are
the
important
component
of
micro
irrigation
system.
Already ,
I
discussed
in
Lecture
1.
I
have
already
given
you
the
benefits
of
micro
irrigation
system.
That
is
what
I
am
telling
I
am
refreshing
you.
These
are
the
components
in
the
blue
color
boxes.
If
you
see
these
are
the
means,
when
we
are
using
micro
irrigation
system,
there
is
an
improvement
in
the
flexibility .
Improves
in
the
tolerance
of
the
soil
salinity
if
this
saline
soil
is
there
to
a
certain
extent,
crops
can
be
grown.
It
reduces
the
crop
failure.
Increment
in
the
crop
yield,
crop
quality ,
maximizing
the
water
use
efficiency .
In
previous
slide,
I
was
telling
you
about
the
water
use
efficiency
30
to
40%.
Here,
we
can
go
for
a
very
high.
So,
now
then,
when
we
come
to
the,
this
part,
if
you
look
here,
there
is
a
reduction
in
the
energy,
reduction
in
the
cost,
labor
cost,
reduction
in
the
fertilizer
use,
reduction
in
the
use.
So,
these
are
the
other
you
know important component how the micro irrigation is useful.
Micro
irrigation
potential,
if
you
look
at
the
in
as
agriculture
is
the
maximum
water
consuming
sector .
I
am
repeating
this
sentence
again
and
again
to
make
you
understand
that
yes
agriculture
is
assumed
takes
huge
bulk
of
water
for
irrigation
part.
And,
this
should
be
utilized
efficiently
so
that
we
can
save
and
bring
more
area
under
cultivation.
So,
if
we
go
for
adopting,
when
we
are
telling
we
are
telling
that
there
is
a
saving
in
water .
So,
when
we
are
adopting
micro
irrigation
system,
farmers
without
much
technical
resources
can
lead
to
increased
yield,
bring
additional
area
under
cultivation.
After
the
farmers
as
well
as
the
huge
government
programs,
agriculture
universities,
technical
institutions
like
IITs,
Central
Government
fund
agencies
institutions
like
ICAR
Institute,
they
worked
day
and
night.
They
carried out research work.
Initially ,
when
this
particular
thing
it
was
there
in
1980
it
was
only
simply
1500
acre.
But,
because
of
the
continuous
effort
by
the
government,
continuous
effort
by
the
research
institutions
that
has
made
quite
a
good
impact
that
it
has
brought
90
lakh
hectare
under
micro
irrigation
system.
But,
this
is
very
meager
as
compared
to
the
potential
of
69.5
million
hectare.
Means,
you
can
see
here
from
1980
to
2018.
So,
in
38
years,
we,
only
this
much
area
we
have
brought
in.
So,
it
is
a
very
slow
pace,
we
need
to
give
more
awareness,
more
activities among the farmers so that they can adopt these technologies.So,
Government
of
India
has
initiated
lot
of
programs
in
order
to
bring
more
area
under
irrigation.
So,
as,
MI
was
introduced
in
our
country
in
1980.
But,
it
was
at
research
stage.
Only
few
farmers
were
taken
and
then
these
were
demonstrated
in
the
farmers’
field.
But,
it
was
a
very
small.
But,
after
recognizing
the
benefits
of
micro
irrigation
system,
Government
of India initiated subsidy scheme from 8th plan onwards.
A
range
of
micro
irrigation
subsidy
schemes
were
offered
to
small
and
marginal
farmers
for
adoption
of
micro
irrigation
technologies.
Then,
Government
of
India
set
up
a
task
force
committee
in
2004.
And,
this
particular
committee
it
recommended
the
more
financial
aid
and
then
liberalizing
the
scheme
making
more
flexibility
so
that
this
scheme
can
be
further
strengthened the MI adoption.
So,
based
on
the
success
of
centralized
subsidy
scheme
in
2006,
micro
irrigation
scheme
was
upgraded
to
a
mission
mode
in
2010
by
National
Mission
on
micro
irrigation.
And
then,
in
the
National
Mission
on
micro
irrigation
that
is
NMMI,
this
subsidy
was
given
50%
to
the
state
government
where
required
to
contribute.
So,
in
50%,
40%
was
from
the
central
government,
10%
was
from
the
state
government.
And,
some
of
the
states
were
further
giving
subsidies
to
the
woman
farmers,
to
the
Scheduled
Caste,
Scheduled
Tribe
farmers.
They
were
giving subsidy to the tune of so, 40%, so, 90% subsidy was available in some of the states.
So,
like
this,
there
the
lot
of
emphasis
is
being
was
given
in
2014.
This
particular
scheme
NMMI
was
subsumed
to
National
Mission
on
Sustainable
Agriculture.
That
is
NMSA.
So,
with
the
On
Farm
Water
Management
with
the
more
focus
on
micro
irrigation
was
given.
NMSA
scheme
was
under gone
further
change
in
the
introduction
of
Pradhan
Mantri
Krishi
Sinchayee
Yojana
which
focuses
on
water
to
every
farm.
‘Har
khet
ko
pani’
this
was
the
slogan
of
honorable
Prime
Minister
with
this
shift
focus
on
more
crop
per
acre
or
to
more
crop
per
drop.
So,
this
is
the
scheme.
And,
this
scheme
is
initiated
in
the
May
2015.
And,
this
scheme
is
continuing
and
in
the
year
2021-22
budget
5,000
crore
rupees
fund
has
been
allocated
under
micro
irrigation
for
micro
irrigation
which
is
being
implemented
by
NABARD.And,
for
promotion,
an,
another
5,000,
once
this
fund
is
exhausted.
So,
total
10,000
crores
rupees
have
been
kept
for
promotion
of
micro
irrigation
system.
Now ,
success
of
these
schemes
will
require
large
number
of
trained
engineers.
These
engineers
will
be
agricultural
engineers,
civil
engineers,
scientist,
horticulturist
from
the
horticulture,
agronomy ,
soil
science,
extension
worker ,
agriculture
extension,
and
management
professionals
will
be
needed to implement this scheme.
Now ,
these
engineers
and
social
workers
as
well
as
scientists
they
are
supposed
to
deal
because
what
we
find
in
the
field
there
are
some
certain
use.
So,
they
are
supposed
to
convince
farmers
because
that
farmers
are
still
they
need
motivation
to
adopt
micro
irrigation
system.
And
then,
of
course,
there
is
a,
another
important
thing
that
the
banks
are
supposed
to
come
forward
and
promote
financing
machineries
to
the
beneficiaries
so
that
this
scheme
can
be
implemented
successfully .
We
keep
on
changing
the
policy
that
is
of
course
program.
I
we
have
very
little
role
to
play.
But,
yes,
this
is
also
important
that
such
schemes
should
not
keep
on
changing
so
frequently .
And
then,
this
should
be
implemented
more
in
effective
means
so
that the lar ge number of farming community they should be benefited.
There
are
lot
of
opportunities
and
scope
for
implementing
micro
irrigation
system.
The,
one
opportunity
from
the
implementation
point
of
view
I
can
tell
here,
it
is
the
horticultural
crop
that
has
given
lot
of
boost
to
using
micro
irrigation
system
or
we
can
say
that
they
are
so,
means
there
is
a
good
match
with
the
horticultural
crops
and
micro
irrigation
schemes.
So,
over
the
years,
you
can
see
here,
horticultural
crops
growth
it
has
gone
up.
And,
horticulture,
when
we
talk
of
the
GDP
part,
one
third
of
agriculture
GDP
is
it
is
from
the
horticultural
crop
which
is
cultivated
from
one
fifth
of
the
agricultural
land
area.
One
fifth,
it
comes
under
horticultural
crop.
But,
it
is
contributing
to
the
one
third
of
GDP .
Micro
irrigation
plays
an
important role in the development of horticulture. This is what I am telling.
The
growth
it
has
come
because
of
the
implementation
of
micro
irrigation.
And
then,
means
some
of
these
things
which
are
important
that
is
the
development
of
nursery ,
development
of
fruit
crops
and
then
vegetable
and
flowers.
It
has
huge
scope
for
bringing
large
area
which
is
falling
under
the
waste
land.
So,
that
can
be
brought
under
micro
irrigation
with
limited
water .
Some
crops
can
be
grown
which
is
lying
idle
and
that
can
be
brought.
And
then,
it
canbe
used
for
the
area
which
are
saline
area,
degraded
land,
difficult
terrain.
These
are
all
can
be
brought
under
the
micro
irrigation.
Implementation
of
MI
is
happening
in
new
emer ging
areas.
Mainly ,
I
told
tell
you
that
precision
agriculture
where
the
there
is
a
scope
for
all
other
disciplines.
Other
discipline
I
mean,
so,
besides
agriculture
engineering
discipline,
there
are
many
other
disciplines.
They
can
come
forward
in
the
area
of
precision
agriculture.
And
then,
implementation
of
solar
powered
irrigation
system
and
integration
of
information
and
communication
technology ,
IoT
based
MI
system
for
automation
of
micro
irrigation
systems.
So,
other
disciplines
of
engineering,
they
can
also
play
very
important
role.
So,
there
is
a
good scope exist for micro irrigation system.
Now ,
let
us
come
to
the
concluding
part.
Now ,
in
concluding
part,
let
us
see
that
what
we
have
learned
over
the
things.
So,
in
view
of
the
above
stated
facts,
this
course
has
been
developed
to
educate
and
transfer
knowledge
to
young
budding
engineers
and
other
stakeholders of micro irrigation technology .
We
have
covered
in
this
particular
course,
there
are
total
11
modules
and,
in
Module
1,
we
are
talking
fundamentals
of
fluid
mechanics.
Here,
we
are
not
really
giving
the
course
of
full
fluid
mechanics.
Only
we
are
refreshing
your
knowledge
what
has
been
taught
in
your
basic
course
of
fluid
mechanics
which
can
be
which
is
applied
in
the
migration
system.
Only
those
things
are
being
discussed.
So,
these
are
the
topics
which
are
given
in
this
one.
That
is
fluid
properties,
Bernoulli’ s
Principle
means
energy
equation,
continuity
equation,
Navier
Stokes
equation
and
then
concept
of
the
basic
fundamentals
of
the
soil
water
concept,
then,
water
movement
to
the
soil.
All
the
things
are
discussed
in
the
Module
1.
That
is
your
fundamentals
of fluid mechanics and soil water .
Then,
water
requirement
of
crops
where
we
have
discussed
about
the
evapotranspiration.
And
then,
the
determination
methods
of
ET,
the
crop
types
and
there,
for
their,
you
know ,
finding
out
their
water
requirement,
then
crop
coefficient.
The,
another
important
part
is
that
yes
you
have
been
exposed
for
the
different
types
of
agro
metrological
instrument
to
a
these
instruments
which
are
installed
in
the
field
that
has
been
given
you
enough
coverage.Lysimeter ,
the
different
types
of
Lysimeter
which
in
the
laboratory ,
how
to
determine
the
water
requirement
of
the
crop
by
using
the
Lysimeter .
That
has
been
covered
in
this
particular
thing and that was demonstrated to you.
We
also
discussed
in
the
Module
3
about
the
irrigation
water
management,
irrigation
scheduling,
and
instruments
for
water
monitoring
in
soil
and
plant,
measurement
of
water ,
so,
all
these
things
which
we
have
discussed
in
the
Module
3.
Module
4,
water
lifting
devices.
And
then,
in
all
these
lectures,
we
have
been
telling
about
the
also
solving
numerical
problems
to
give
you
more
exposure,
give
you
confidence
on
these
topics.
So,
this
we
have
discussed
now.
In
all
these,
if
you
see
Module
1
to
Module
4,
these
were
the
basic
fundamental,
basic
concept.
And,
these
basic
fundamental
concept,
we
are
using
it
in
the
micro irrigation system development.
So,
the
different
types
of
micro
irrigation
system,
we
demonstrated
in
the
field.
We
demonstrated
you
the
drippers.
We
demonstrated
you
micro
sprinklers.
We
have
demonstrated
you
how
to
evaluate
the
micro
irrigation
drip
emitter ,
the
soil
water
movement
under
drip
emitters.
This
is
a
research
topic.
This
is
not
only
simply
just
learning
but
how
the
water
is
moving.
So,
students
from
means
postgraduate
students
as
well
as
PhD
research
student,
they
can
take
up
their
research
topic,
when
the
water
not
only
water
when
the
fertilizer is added with the water .
So,
solute
transport
through
the
soil
that
can
be
understood
by
these
things,
so,
this
is
a
good
scope
it
exists.
Then,
filters,
the
fertigation
system,
how
to
design
the
economic
system,
so,
there
are
micro
irrigation
industries,
they
should
come
forward
and
then
they
can
also
take
part
in
the
design
of
drippers.
They
can
take
part
in
the
design
of
the
drippers,
the,
how
to
economically design the filters, how to economically design the fertigation system.
That
is
an
important
part.
So,
micro
irrigation
industries
as
well
as
for
the
students
those
who
are
attending
this
course,
it
is
useful
for
them.
Sprinkler
irrigation
system,
the
theory
part,
it
has
been
covered.
Also,
we
have
given
a
numerical
problems
and
then
evaluation
by
the
experiments. So, experiments has been conducted and you have demonstrated in this one.Then,
the
Module
7
is
Standards
and
Quality
Assurance
of
Sprinkler
Irrigation
System,
Drip
Irrigation
System.
That
has
been
covered
which
is
an
important
aspect
of
this
course.
Any
material
which
is
being
manufactured,
it
should
be
passed
through
the
standards
so
that
its
life it can be tested and it can operate for a longer period.
Then,
the
solar
PV
operated
micro
irrigation
system
is
dealt
in
Module
8.
There
are
large
number
of
electronics
engineer ,
electrical
engineer ,
they
are
needed
to
design
the
system.
They
are
needed
for
designing
the
design
of
the
solar
PV
systems
so
that
economical
system
solar
PV
system
that
can
be
developed.
And
then,
that
can
be
used
for
irrigation
systems,
so,
integration
of
solar
PV
system
with
micro
irrigation
system
that
has
been
also
taught
in
this
particular course.
Then,
the
automation
of
micro
irrigation
system,
this
is
another
important
part
where
electronics,
electrical
engineers,
agriculture
engineers
should
learn
about
the
basic
electronics
course,
electrical
engineering
course
so
that
they
can
become
confident
on
operating
and
designing
the
automated
irrigation
system.
That
has
been
covered
in
Module
9.
Module
10
is
for
the
economic
evaluation
of
micro
irrigation
system.
This
is
a
very
important
component.
Any
system
will
be
economic.
Unless,
it
is
not
economically
viable,
it
will
not
be
accepted
by
the
society .
It
will
not
be
accepted
by
the
stakeholders.
So,
this
is
important
components
and
different terminology which are there. This has been done in Module 10.
Module
11
is
precision
agriculture.
This
is
another
important
interesting
topic
where
micro
irrigation
system
has
been
used.
And
then,
other
disciplines
of
engineering,
plant
science
people,
plant
pathology
persons,
they
are
needed
for
precision
agriculture.
So,
this
particular
course
discovers
this
part
also.
And
then,
we
are
concluding
the,
this
particular
thing.
That
is
your epilogue of migration system. That is in the Module 1 1.
Now ,
it
is
now
my
duty
to
thank
and
mainly
I
want
to
thank
the
authors
of
the
various
books
which
I
have
used.
And,
their
book
chapters,
I
have
used.
Research
papers,
I
have
referred.
And
then,
the
proceedings
of
the
conferences,
images,
animations,
which
I
have
taken
from
the
internet
that
has
helped
me
in
developing
this
course
which
is
purely
the
purpose
is
only
for
the
educational
and
academic
purpose.
So,
that
the
more
and
more
person,
they
can
workin
this
area.
They
can
develop
the
confidence.
And
then,
this
can
go
to
the
farming
community in a lar ge way .
Now ,
I
want
to
thank
the
NPTEL
authorities
at
the
IIT
Madras,
at
IIT
Kharagpur
and
then
the
all
the
staff
of
NPTEL.
They
have
helped
me
in
developing
this
course.
So,
I
want
to
thank
them.
My
research
scholars,
Mr.
Mahesh
Hadole,
he
helped
all
throughout
from
Lecture
1
to
Lecture
60.
All
the
lectures
in
developing
the
PowerPoint
presentation,
helping
me
in
conducting
the
laboratory
classes,
so,
I
thank
Mr.
Mahesh
and
Miss.
Chitra
Shukla.
She
also
helped in developing this course content.
Now ,
since,
this
is
the
last
lecture,
so,
at
the
end
of
this
particular
course,
all
the
students,
you
have
already
under gone
the
various
lectures
and
submitted
assignment.
So,
there
will
be
online
examination
to
pass
this
subject.
So,
thank
you
very
much
and
I
wish
you
good
luck.
Best of luck, Thank you.
