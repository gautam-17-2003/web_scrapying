Food Distribution
USDA's food distribution programs strengthen the nutrition safety net through the distribution of USDA Foods and other nutrition assistance to children, low-income families, emergency feeding programs, Indian reservations, and the elderly.
Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)
The Commodity Supplemental Food Program works to improve the health of low-income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, children, and the elderly by supplementing their diets with nutritious USDA Foods.
Department of Defense (DoD) Fresh Fruit & Vegetable Program
USDA's Food and Nutrition Service partners with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Produce Business Unit to buy and distribute fresh fruits and vegetables to schools using the USDA's federal commodity entitlement dollars.
Food Aid Program
The Food Aid Program provides U.S. agricultural commodities to feed millions of hungry people in needy countries through direct donations and concessional programs.
Food Distribution Disaster Assistance Program
The Food Distribution Disaster Assistance Program supplies USDA Foods to disaster relief organizations such as the Red Cross and the Salvation Army for mass feeding or household distribution.
Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)
The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations provides USDA Foods to low-income Native American families and elderly people residing on or near Indian reservations.
Food Purchase Program
USDA purchases a variety of food products in support of the National School Lunch program and other Federal Feeding programs. These purchases help to stabilize prices in agricultural commodity markets by balancing supply and demand.
McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program
The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program helps promote education, child development, and food security for some of the world's poorest children. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance, for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects in low-income countries.
National Processing Pilot Program
Under this pilot program, processors are permitted to sell approved end products that contain USDA Foods to eligible recipient agencies nationwide under a single national processing agreement.
Schools/Child Nutrition (CN) USDA Foods Program
The Schools/Child Nutrition USDA Foods Program helps American agricultural producers by purchasing nutritious food for the National School Lunch Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Summer Food Service Program. These purchases help to stabilize prices in agricultural commodity markets by balancing supply and demand.
The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)
The Emergency Food Assistance Program supplements the diets of low-income needy persons, including elderly people, by providing emergency food and nutrition assistance.
USDA Foods Processing
USDA Foods Processing allows State Distributing Agencies and Eligible Recipient Agencies, such as school districts, to contract with commercial food processors to convert raw bulk USDA Foods into more convenient, ready-to-use end products.
