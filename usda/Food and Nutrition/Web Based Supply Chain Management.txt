About WBSCM
The Web Based Supply Chain Management (WBSCM) system is an integrated, internet-based commodity ordering, acquisition, distribution, and tracking system. WBSCM supports domestic and international food aid and nutrition assistance programs, as well as marketing programs for American produced and processed commodities. Multiple programs, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), serve over 30 million Americans and are administered through 98 State Distributing Agencies (SDAs), supporting over 100,000 Recipient Agency (RA) school districts, food banks, and feeding centers, and 113 Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs), supporting over 75,000 program participants.
Household-level programs, such as Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), TEFAP, and FDPIR, serve food to insecure groups such as senior citizen, Native Americans, and low-income citizens. International programs, which include Food for Peace, Food for Progress, and Food for Education, serve over 280 million people in over 65 countries with aid provided through the United Nations World Food Program and over 30 foreign governments, and approximately 70 private voluntary organizations (PVOs).
USDA Foods account for nearly 20 percent of the value of school districts food purchases menus. On a yearly basis, WBSCM directly supports the order, procurement, and delivery of over 6.5 billion pounds of American farm food commodities with a value in excess of $4 billion.
