Commodity Procurement
The consumer demand for locally-produced food is creating jobs and opportunity throughout rural America for farms, businesses and entrepreneurs that store, process, market and distribute food locally and regionally. Farm and business opportunities continue to increase as the market share of local and regional foods grows. Across USDA, there are resources, loans and grants to help farmers, ranchers and food businesses find new opportunities in this expanding agricultural sector. Here you can connect with the many programs, research, and educational materials that can help you meet this demand.
