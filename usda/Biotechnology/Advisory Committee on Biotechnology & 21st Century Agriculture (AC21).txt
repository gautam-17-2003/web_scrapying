Advisory Committee on Biotechnology & 21st Century Agriculture (AC21)


The Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21) was originally established in February, 2003 and first met in June, 2003. Under its Charter, the committee is charged with examining the long-term impacts of biotechnology on the U.S. food and agriculture system and USDA, and providing guidance to USDA on pressing individual issues, identified by the Office of the Secretary, related to the application of biotechnology in agriculture. The AC21 is a broad-based committee representing a wide range of interests and agricultural expertise.


The AC21, which met frequently between 2003 and 2008, has been revived by Agriculture Secretary Vilsack to focus in the near term on a specific topic: to develop practical recommendations for strengthening coexistence among different agricultural production methods. The Committee will meet 3 or 4 times per year in public session to discuss this topic.


All materials for committee meetings, meeting summaries and transcripts, as well as committee reports and recommendations will be posted on this website.
