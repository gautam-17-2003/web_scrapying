USDA works everyday to strengthen the American agricultural economy. Despite the difficult economic climate of the past years, our efforts - coupled with the 2008 Farm Bill, the Recovery Act, and the hard work and resilience of America's farmers and ranchers - are helping American agriculture lead the nation's recovery. We maintain a strong and appropriate safety net for America's farmers, ranchers and growers which includes assistance to struggling industries, disaster assistance, and crop insurance, and provide technical assistance, access to credit, and help producers implement conservation practices.
To ensure that America remains the world leader in crop production, we conduct cutting-edge agricultural research. And to build a stronger agricultural economy for future generations, we work to improve both domestic and international markets, to create new income opportunities - like renewable energy - for America's producers, and to grow the next generation of American farmers.
