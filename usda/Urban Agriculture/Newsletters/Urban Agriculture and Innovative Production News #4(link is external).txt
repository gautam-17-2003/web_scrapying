Regional Food Business Centers Program
The goal of the
American Rescue Plan Technical Assistance Investment Program
is to ensure improved understanding of and equitable participation in the full range of USDA programs and services among underserved farmers, ranchers, forest landowners and operators. Through this program, a network of cooperators is working collaboratively with USDA and with other cooperators to deliver targeted technical assistance programs and outreach activities focused on a range of topics.
There is still time to complete the
2022 Census of Agriculture
! Even small plots of land - whether rural or urban - growing fruit, vegetables or some food animals count if $1,000 or more of such products were raised and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the Census year. Producers can respond online at
usda.gov
or by mail.

The
Food and Agriculture Mapper and Explorer
brings together data from dozens of publicly available datasets to make it easy for food system practitioners to search and visualize up-to-date information about U.S. local and regional food systems. This new tool is an open-access resource designed to increase the accessibility of local and regional food systems data for federal grant applicants, farmers and food entrepreneurs, and researchers. To learn more about navigating this tool with case study examples, watch the
recorded webinar online
