One Health


















The health of animals, people and the environment is connected. The "One Health" approach is the collaborative effort of the human health, veterinary health and environmental health communities. Through this collaboration, USDA achieves optimal health outcomes for both animals and people.


With its partners such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Environmental Protection Agency, tribal Nations, USDA seeks to maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society.


USDA serves the nation through its commitment to producing wholesome and nutritious foods; ensuring the safety of plant and animal commodities entering the country; safeguarding the health and welfare food-producing animals; and preventing entry and/or controlling plant and animal pathogens. These cumulative actions ensure the health and safety of humans through these One Health partnerships.










Domestic and Global Challenges that

Require a One Health Approach








Antimicrobial Resistance


Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been an area of focus during the past two decades as USDA plays a dual role in protecting animal agriculture and public health. USDA recognizes AMR as a potential and serious threat and focuses on surveillance, research and development, and education, extension and outreach.

Influenza in Swine


While influenza viruses almost always remain infectious only within their host species, at times infections may spread to other species. The main influenza viruses circulating in U.S. pigs in recent years are H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2. Influenza viruses in pigs can occasionally infect people, and human influenza viruses can infect swine.
